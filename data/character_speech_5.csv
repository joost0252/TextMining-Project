"5","Scene: The Cafeteria"
"5","Sheldon: It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like."
"5","Leonard: What are you grinding about?"
"5","Sheldon: Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like."
"5","Leonard: Just let it go, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we? (Mimes doing so) Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out food) Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend."
"5","Leonard: They slept together, Sherlock."
"5","Sheldon: No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like."
"5","Leonard: She lied."
"5","Sheldon: Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?"
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Howard: Hey."
"5","Raj: Hey."
"5","Leonard: Hey."
"5","Sheldon: Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
"5","Leonard: No, I’m fine with it."
"5","Sheldon: That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were."
"5","Leonard: What the hell is wrong with you?"
"5","Howard: Yeah, how could you do that?"
"5","Raj: What is it to you?"
"5","Howard: I got his back."
"5","Raj: Yeah, right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard."
"5","Howard: Hey, if I wasn’t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me."
"5","Leonard: Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals."
"5","Raj: Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love."
"5","Leonard and Howard together: What?"
"5","Sheldon: Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me."
"5","Howard: You’re not in love with Penny."
"5","Raj: Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love."
"5","Howard: Who?"
"5","Raj: He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot."
"5","Leonard: Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee."
"5","Howard: I’m sorry. What?"
"5","Raj: Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish."
"5","Leonard: Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."
"5","Raj: That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny."
"5","Sheldon: For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny has a bottle of wine. She can’t find a glass. Finds a measuring jug and uses that instead. There is a knock on the door."
"5","Penny: Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles."
"5","Amy: Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few."
"5","Penny: You heard what I did?"
"5","Amy: Well, I heard who you did."
"5","Penny: Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore."
"5","Amy: Don’t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?"
"5","Penny: No."
"5","Amy: She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse."
"5","Penny: I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?"
"5","Amy: She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy."
"5","Scene: Raj’s apartment. There is a knock on the door. He opens it."
"5","Bernadette: You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!"
"5","Raj: Please, come in."
"5","Bernadette: What the hell is wrong with you?"
"5","Raj: Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me."
"5","Bernadette: I’m nice to everyone."
"5","Raj: I’m sorry."
"5","Bernadette: Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never been anything between us."
"5","Raj: I will. Hey, Bernadette?"
"5","Bernadette: What?!"
"5","Raj: Do you think I have a shot with Penny?"
"5","Bernadette: Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Penny: You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants."
"5","Amy: You can’t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex."
"5","Penny: You know what? Let’s get out of here."
"5","Amy: Where are we going?"
"5","Penny: Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. (Opens door. Sees Leonard and Sheldon. Slams it shut again.)"
"5","Sheldon: Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?"
"5","Penny: Can I stay at your place for a few nights?"
"5","Amy: Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay."
"5","Penny: Yeah, sure. Yay!"
"5","Amy: We’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I’ll teach you my secret language, Op."
"5","Penny: Sounds great."
"5","Amy: Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top."
"5","Penny: Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag."
"5","Amy: No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Leonard: Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?"
"5","Sheldon: Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you."
"5","Leonard: I’m not in the mood, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. (Showing laptop screen)"
"5","Leonard: I don’t want to talk to Amy."
"5","Sheldon: No, it’s not Amy."
"5","Dr Hofstadter: Hello, dear."
"5","Leonard: You called my mother?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"
"5","Dr Hofstadter: He’s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening."
"5","Leonard: What’s going on? What do you want?"
"5","Dr Hofstadter: Sheldon informed me that you’re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I’m here to help."
"5","Leonard: That’s so nice."
"5","Dr Hofstadter: And we’re back to the obvious. Now, what’s up?"
"5","Leonard: Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone."
"5","Dr Hofstadter: I understand."
"5","Leonard: Got any advice?"
"5","Dr Hofstadter: Yes. Buck up."
"5","Leonard: Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?"
"5","Dr Hofstadter: Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants."
"5","Leonard: Thanks, Mother. I feel much better."
"5","Dr Hofstadter: If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off."
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is brushing Penny’s hair."
"5","Amy: Ninety-nine, one hundred. It’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn."
"5","Penny: You know, I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."
"5","Amy: Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids."
"5","Penny: I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska."
"5","Amy: No, I can’t let you do that."
"5","Penny: Why not? (There is a knock on the door)"
"5","Amy: For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you."
"5","Raj: Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?"
"5","Amy: A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better."
"5","Penny: How did you know I was here?"
"5","Raj: It’s all over her Facebook page."
"5","Amy: I’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer."
"5","Penny: Thanks."
"5","Amy: No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?"
"5","Penny: So, hi. What’s up?"
"5","Raj: I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo."
"5","Penny: Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…"
"5","Raj: Aw, there’s a thing."
"5","Penny: Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships."
"5","Raj: You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles."
"5","Penny: Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles."
"5","Raj: Oh. All right."
"5","Penny: Thank you."
"5","Raj: Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense."
"5","Penny: Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?"
"5","Raj: No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection."
"5","Penny: Oh, you did, didn’t you?"
"5","Raj: Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote."
"5","Penny: So, we didn’t actually…"
"5","Raj: I did. It was beautiful."
"5","Penny: Oh!"
"5","Raj: Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this."
"5","Penny: Of course I won’t. No, I won’t."
"5","Raj: Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?"
"5","Penny: Sure."
"5","Raj: Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?"
"5","Raj: Can I say I ruined you for white men?"
"5","Penny: Also no."
"5","Raj: Okay, just the candle thing."
"5","Penny: Yeah."
"5","Raj: Cool. All right friend."
"5","Penny: Hmm."
"5","Raj: I’ll see you around."
"5","Penny: Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. (She hugs him.)"
"5","Raj: Penny?"
"5","Penny: Mm-hmm?"
"5","Raj: It’s getting beautiful again."
"5","Scene: A shed on the paintball range."
"5","Sheldon: All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle."
"5","Howard: I don’t see anything."
"5","Sheldon: Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out."
"5","Leonard: Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?"
"5","Howard: Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee."
"5","Raj: Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor."
"5","Leonard: You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?"
"5","Howard: Fine with me."
"5","Raj: Sure, whatever."
"5","Sheldon: You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit."
"5","Leonard: Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games."
"5","Sheldon: This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?"
"5","Leonard: Yes, no and no."
"5","Sheldon: Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing."
"5","Howard: Let it go, Sheldon. I’ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home."
"5","Sheldon: No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be."
"5","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"5","Sheldon: Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. (Walks outside) Geology isn’t a real science! (Gets hit by countless paintball pellets)"
"5","Howard: Damn those sons of bitches!"
"5","Leonard: Let’s get ’em!"
"5","Sheldon: If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!"
"5","Leonard: I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper."
"5","Howard and Raj: Here, here."
"5","Sheldon: Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal."
"5","Penny: Hi. You guys have a minute?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, yeah, sure."
"5","Penny: Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything."
"5","Raj: Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower."
"5","Penny: Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?"
"5","Raj: Sorry. Go on."
"5","Penny: Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska."
"5","Leonard: You’re leaving?"
"5","Howard: What are you going to do in Nebraska?"
"5","Penny: I don’t know, maybe teach acting. (Phone rings) Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?"
"5","Leonard: Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman."
"5","Penny: Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday."
"5","Sheldon: What about Nebraska?"
"5","Penny: Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!"
"5","Sheldon (to Leonard): Have you ever thought of teaching physics?"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Penny’s ad is on the television. She is at a stables."
"5","Actress: Ready to ride?"
"5","Penny (on screen): I don’t think so, Mom. Not today."
"5","Actress: Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?"
"5","Penny (on screen): You don’t know the half of it."
"5","Actress: Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this."
"5","Penny (on screen): Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?"
"5","Actress: Now, the H is for Her."
"5","Leonard: I’m proud of you."
"5","Penny: Shh! Here comes my joke."
"5","Actress: How are you doing?"
"5","Penny (on screen): Sittin’ pretty."
"5","i love you~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"

"5","Series 05 Episode 02 – The Infestation Hypothesis"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Leonard is laying out wine and napkins in front of his laptop."
"5","Sheldon: What are you doing?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date."
"5","Sheldon: It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?"
"5","Leonard: Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast."
"5","Sheldon: All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"
"5","Leonard: That doesn’t sound like mocking."
"5","Sheldon: You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are those soy-based candles?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know. Why?"
"5","Sheldon: Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes)."
"5","Leonard: Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
"5","Leonard: Yes, I’ve always admired that about you."
"5","Sheldon: As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here."
"5","Leonard: Oh, good."
"5","Sheldon: Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby."
"5","Leonard: A hobby?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money."
"5","Leonard: You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
"5","Sheldon: When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized."
"5","Leonard: You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?"
"5","Sheldon: Don’t you like Amy?"
"5","Leonard: Of course I like Amy."
"5","Sheldon: Well, there’s the difference. (Skype tone rings)"
"5","Leonard: Excuse me, that’s Priya."
"5","Priya (on screen): Hi, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Hey, honey."
"5","Priya: I miss you."
"5","Leonard: Oh, I miss you, too."
"5","Sheldon: I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Sheldon: Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend."
"5","Penny: Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple."
"5","Sheldon: If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."
"5","Penny: I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles."
"5","Sheldon: A good wife would go to the store."
"5","Penny: I want a divorce."
"5","Sheldon: Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair."
"5","Penny: It’s great, isn’t it?"
"5","Sheldon: It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name."
"5","Penny: What name?"
"5","Sheldon: Chair."
"5","Penny: Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away."
"5","Sheldon: What?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here."
"5","Sheldon (jumps up): Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (Starts stripping off clothing)"
"5","Penny: What is wrong?"
"5","Sheldon: I’ve been sitting in garbage!"
"5","Penny: Sheldon, take it easy."
"5","Sheldon: You take it easy! I need to use your shower."
"5","Penny: I went into this marriage with so much hope."
"5","Sheldon: There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out of apartment)."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: Howard’s workshop."
"5","Raj: This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before."
"5","Howard: Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand."
"5","Leonard: That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?"
"5","Howard: Hang on."
"5","Raj: Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini."
"5","Howard: Hand me the tuna melt."
"5","Leonard: Yep."
"5","Howard: Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?"
"5","Leonard: Not easy, but we’re making it work."
"5","Howard: When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?"
"5","Leonard: What?"
"5","Howard: You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow."
"5","Raj: Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about."
"5","Howard: Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it."
"5","Leonard: There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk."
"5","Howard: Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth."
"5","Leonard: I can’t do that."
"5","Howard: Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books."
"5","Raj: How can you be so racist?"
"5","Howard: Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong."
"5","Sheldon (entering): Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice."
"5","Leonard: I did it last night, I’m not doing it again."
"5","Howard: Just his head, right?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair."
"5","Sheldon: Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."
"5","Sheldon: Name one time I’ve ever done that."
"5","Leonard: How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again."
"5","Sheldon: I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment door."
"5","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"5","Penny: Yello."
"5","Sheldon: You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard."
"5","Penny: Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions."
"5","Sheldon: Really?"
"5","Penny: Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there."
"5","Sheldon: It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring."
"5","Penny: Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?"
"5","Sheldon: All right. It is a comfortable chair."
"5","Penny: Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?"
"5","Sheldon: No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment."
"5","Leonard: It’s like living with a Chihuahua."
"5","Sheldon (at Penny’s door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"5","Penny: What’s up, buttercup?"
"5","Sheldon: You have to get rid of the chair."
"5","Penny: Nope. (Closes door)"
"5","Penny: What’s the word, hummingbird?"
"5","Sheldon: For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death."
"5","Penny: No. (Closes door)"
"5","Penny: What’s the gist, physicist?"
"5","Sheldon: Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"5","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom."
"5","Leonard: So, here we are. Back in bed together."
"5","Priya (on laptop screen): Yep, here we are."
"5","Leonard: Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in."
"5","Priya: All right."
"5","Leonard: Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?"
"5","Priya: What?"
"5","Leonard: Not good?"
"5","Priya: That’s terrible. Try again."
"5","Leonard: Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?"
"5","Priya: Oh, yes. Yes, I am."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!"
"5","Priya: God, Leonard, stop talking."
"5","Leonard: Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back."
"5","Priya: Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you."
"5","Leonard: Okay, like usual. Good."
"5","Priya: Take off your shirt."
"5","Leonard: All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples."
"5","Priya: I said be quiet."
"5","Leonard: Yes, ma’am."
"5","Priya: Now take off your shorts."
"5","Leonard: Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!"
"5","Priya: Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes."
"5","Leonard: Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!"
"5","Priya: Here I am, baby. You miss these?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, damn it!"
"5","Priya: Oh, Leonard! Already?"
"5","Leonard: No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second."
"5","Priya: Fine."
"5","Leonard: So, how are your mom and dad?"
"5","Priya: Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now."
"5","Leonard: Yeah. Sure, sure."
"5","Sheldon (calling from outside): If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack."
"5","Leonard: Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks."
"5","Sheldon (still off): You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here."
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing a harp."
"5","Amy: Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…"
"5","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy."
"5","Amy: Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?"
"5","Sheldon: Is not. Is not, is not."
"5","Amy: Denial. Denial, denial. Come in."
"5","Sheldon: Thank you."
"5","Amy: Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?"
"5","Sheldon: No."
"5","Amy: How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…"
"5","Amy: Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?"
"5","Sheldon: You’re good friends with Penny, right?"
"5","Amy: Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on."
"5","Sheldon: I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture."
"5","Amy: For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?"
"5","Sheldon: Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me."
"5","Amy: Yes, I am."
"5","Sheldon: Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate."
"5","Sheldon: All right, name your price."
"5","Amy: Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before."
"5","Sheldon: You mean like Salt Lake City?"
"5","Amy: Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny."
"5","Amy: Will you listen to me play my harp now?"
"5","Sheldon: No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know about this, Howard."
"5","Howard: What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. (Howard kisses device) Give it a try."
"5","Leonard: I don’t think so."
"5","Raj: I’ll try it. Like this?"
"5","Howard: Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor."
"5","Raj: Like this?"
"5","Howard: Close. Really French it."
"5","Raj: Better?"
"5","Howard: Yeah, you got it, you got it."
"5","Raj: I’m impressed. This is very lifelike."
"5","Howard: Whoa! You just bit my tongue!"
"5","Raj: I, I nibbled. I was being playful."
"5","Howard: Why do you have to make everything weird?"
"5","Raj: Sorry. Better?"
"5","Howard: Oh, yeah."
"5","Penny: Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store."
"5","Amy: I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother."
"5","Penny: You’re kidding."
"5","Amy: Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria."
"5","Penny: And now me."
"5","Amy: I just have one question about the chair."
"5","Penny: And what’s that?"
"5","Amy: Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?"
"5","Penny: No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this."
"5","Amy: No, he didn’t."
"5","Penny: Really?"
"5","Amy: Yes, he did. He absolutely did."
"5","Penny: My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you."
"5","Amy: It is?"
"5","Penny: Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend."
"5","Amy: No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me."
"5","Penny: I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go."
"5","Amy: No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!"
"5","Penny: What’s wrong?"
"5","Amy: Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!"
"5","Penny: Wait. Get up, get up! (She does. Something is moving in the seat cushion. They both run out of the apartment screaming.) Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!"
"5","Amy (between screams): I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!"
"5","Penny (also still screaming): Yeah, sure!"
"5","Leonard: Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out."
"5","Priya (on screen): Oh, Leonard, listen…"
"5","Leonard: No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before."
"5","Priya: Leonard…"
"5","Leonard: That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you."
"5","Priya: My parents are here."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name."
"5","Scene: The street outside the apartment block."
"5","Howard: Check it out. Free chair."
"5","Raj: Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time."
"5","Howard: On three?"
"5","Together: Three!"
"5","Raj: What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?"
"5","Series 05 Episode 03 – The Pulled Groin Extrapolation"
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Leonard: Who wants the last dumpling?"
"5","Penny: Ooh, me."
"5","Sheldon: Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
"5","Penny: Thank you all for this high honour."
"5","Sheldon: I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating."
"5","Howard: All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. (Raj whispers to him) Yeah, well, now it means her."
"5","Bernadette: It’s okay if he wants to come."
"5","Howard: Fine. But next time, we get a sitter."
"5","Penny: All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you."
"5","Sheldon: Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?"
"5","Howard: Neither of them are close."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt."
"5","Penny: Okay, I’m not driving him."
"5","Sheldon: No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this."
"5","Leonard: Aren’t you going with Sheldon?"
"5","Amy: No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele."
"5","Leonard: Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…"
"5","Amy: I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on."
"5","Leonard: Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?"
"5","Amy: Not really, no."
"5","Leonard: All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started."
"5","Amy: Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Amy is staring into space."
"5","Leonard: Amy?"
"5","Amy: Yo."
"5","Leonard: You okay?"
"5","Amy: Oh, sure."
"5","Leonard: I thought you were reading."
"5","Amy: I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable."
"5","Leonard: I, I’m fine."
"5","Amy: Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome."
"5","Leonard: What, who told you that?"
"5","Amy: Well, most recently my gynaecologist."
"5","Leonard: Well, you stay as long as you’d like."
"5","Amy: I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist."
"5","Scene: Raj’s car."
"5","Bernadette: What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic."
"5","Howard: Which side do you come down on?"
"5","Sheldon: I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge."
"5","Howard: Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?"
"5","Bernadette: That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house."
"5","Howard: First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes."
"5","Bernadette: Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?"
"5","Howard: Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house."
"5","Bernadette: Is she moving out?"
"5","Howard: Why would she move out? It’s her house."
"5","Bernadette: Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?"
"5","Sheldon: Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks."
"5","Howard: Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin."
"5","Bernadette: I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever."
"5","Howard: Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues."
"5","Bernadette: Raj, take me home."
"5","Howard: Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre."
"5","Bernadette: Take me home now."
"5","Howard: Movie theatre."
"5","Raj: Mmmmmm."
"5","Sheldon: Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do."
"5","Amy: How was your shower?"
"5","Leonard: It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?"
"5","Amy: Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?"
"5","Leonard: Not really. Is that my yearbook?"
"5","Amy: Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork."
"5","Leonard: Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that."
"5","Amy: If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother."
"5","Leonard: Aw."
"5","Amy: Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom."
"5","Sheldon (entering): Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again."
"5","Leonard: Rough night, Casey Jones?"
"5","Sheldon: You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets."
"5","Leonard: What’s in the bag?"
"5","Sheldon: I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that."
"5","Amy: Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime."
"5","Leonard: Ah, sure. That’d be nice."
"5","Amy: Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department."
"5","Leonard: Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?"
"5","Amy: I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time."
"5","Sheldon: Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age."
"5","Amy: Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change."
"5","Sheldon: Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding."
"5","Scene: Outside Howard’s house. Amy rings the bell."
"5","Howard (off): I’ll get it!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Could you get it?"
"5","Howard (off): I said I’m getting it!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Fine, I’ll get it!"
"5","Howard: I got it! Oh, hi."
"5","Bernadette: Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me."
"5","Howard: Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!"
"5","Howard: The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like."
"5","Bernadette: And your mom would be okay with that?"
"5","Howard: Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?"
"5","Howard: See? She’s good with it."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set."
"5","Sheldon: All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
"5","Penny: You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?"
"5","Amy: Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?"
"5","Penny: Really? For a wedding?"
"5","Amy: Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them."
"5","Leonard: Ready."
"5","Penny: Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond."
"5","Sheldon: Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier."
"5","Amy: I got you this to give to me."
"5","Penny: Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing."
"5","Amy: I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs."
"5","Penny: Put the corsage on her."
"5","Leonard: Amy, this is for you."
"5","Amy: When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist."
"5","Sheldon: All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac."
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"5","Howard: So, dinner went nice."
"5","Bernadette: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?"
"5","Howard: Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!"
"5","Bernadette: I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!"
"5","Howard: Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, God."
"5","Howard: Relax, it’ll be fine."
"5","Bernadette: Okay."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!"
"5","Scene: The wedding."
"5","Amy: Would you like to dance?"
"5","Leonard: No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer."
"5","Amy: You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either."
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy."
"5","Amy: Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm."
"5","Leonard: That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…"
"5","Amy: Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening."
"5","Leonard: Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away."
"5","Amy: I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you."
"5","Leonard: I’m not moody. I’m fun."
"5","Amy: You have any evidence to support that statement?"
"5","Leonard: Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are."
"5","Amy: Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am."
"5","Leonard: Okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
"5","Amy: We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields."
"5","Leonard: Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer."
"5","Amy: Don’t worry, I’ll lead. (They do the Birdie Song dance)"
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom. Howard is playing with a lightsabre."
"5","Amy: Howard?"
"5","Howard: Ready for bed?"
"5","Bernadette: No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour."
"5","Howard: Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): You don’t know that! I just sat down!"
"5","Howard: Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!"
"5","Howard: Problem solved."
"5","Bernadette: No, it’s not. I’m not going in there."
"5","Howard: Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Ha! The eagle has landed!"
"5","Howard: And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love."
"5","Scene: The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs."
"5","Amy: There we go, last floor."
"5","Leonard: I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
"5","Amy: The hokey pokey is a young man’s game."
"5","Leonard: I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while."
"5","Amy: You’re welcome."
"5","Leonard: And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin."
"5","Amy: I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely."
"5","Leonard: Well, okay. Again, thank you."
"5","Amy: And again, you’re welcome."
"5","Leonard: Want to come in, have a cup of tea?"
"5","Amy: No, thanks. I’m gonna head home."
"5","Leonard: Okay. Well, good night."
"5","Amy: Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny’s door)"
"5","Penny: Ames, hi. How was the wedding?"
"5","Amy: Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me."
"5","Penny: Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?"
"5","Amy: Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis."
"5","Penny: Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?"
"5","Amy: The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore."
"5","Penny: Oh, God, did he make a move on you?"
"5","Amy: No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart."
"5","Penny: Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay."
"5","Amy: Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running."
"5","Penny: So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?"
"5","Amy: No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth."
"5","Leonard: Sounds like you had a great night."
"5","Sheldon: I did. How was yours?"
"5","Leonard: Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would."
"5","Sheldon: What exactly do you mean by that?"
"5","Leonard: Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?"
"5","Sheldon: To send a message. She is not for you."
"5","Leonard: What?"
"5","Sheldon: Not for you!"
"5","Bernadette: Good morning, handsome."
"5","Howard: Morning, Mom."
"5","Bernadette: It’s me."
"5","Howard: Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning."
"5","Bernadette: Your mom and I made you breakfast."
"5","Howard: Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?"
"5","Bernadette: Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Does he like the pancakes?!"
"5","Bernadette (in a similar voice): He didn’t try them yet!"
"5","Howard: Is there any butter?"
"5","Bernadette: It’s butter-flavoured syrup."
"5","Howard: Oh."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): So, what’s the word?"
"5","Bernadette: He wants butter!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s butter-flavoured syrup"
"5","Bernadette: I just told him that!"
"5","Howard: I don’t need any butter."
"5","Bernadette: If you want butter, I’ll get you butter."
"5","Howard: Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself."
"5","Series 05 Episode 04 – The Wiggly Finger Catalyst"
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Sheldon: The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?"
"5","Howard: I say, hey Ma, what’s for dinner?”"
"5","Sheldon: Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too."
"5","Leonard: Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?"
"5","Howard: Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted."
"5","Leonard: See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want."
"5","Howard: You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?"
"5","Leonard: Maybe. We enter the dungeon."
"5","Sheldon: You see a dragon."
"5","Howard: Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?"
"5","Sheldon: When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
"5","Leonard: Are you gonna eat that whole pie?"
"5","Raj: Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?"
"5","Raj: No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister."
"5","Leonard: Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."
"5","Raj: You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas."
"5","Howard: Eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas."
"5","Raj: That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips."
"5","Sheldon: Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon."
"5","Raj: I don’t know if I want to play anymore."
"5","Sheldon: Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Amy: Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions."
"5","Penny: Yeah, my bikini region is fine."
"5","Amy: Who’s shocked? I’m not. So, Bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? And I’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!"
"5","Bernadette: We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples."
"5","Penny: Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone."
"5","Bernadette: You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials."
"5","Penny: Well, hello? She’s married."
"5","Bernadette: Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group."
"5","Penny: Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat."
"5","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory."
"5","Leonard: Are we ready to order?"
"5","Sheldon: One moment. I’m conducting an experiment."
"5","Howard: With Dungeons and Dragons dice?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven."
"5","Howard: So, what’s for dinner?"
"5","Sheldon: A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting."
"5","Penny: Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?"
"5","Howard: Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats."
"5","Penny: Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please."
"5","Sheldon: Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas."
"5","Leonard: Do you really want that?"
"5","Sheldon: That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things."
"5","Raj: What’s it thinking about now?"
"5","Sheldon: Hamburgers and lemonade."
"5","Penny: Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf."
"5","Howard (signing): Emily, this is our friend Raj."
"5","Penny: Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good."
"5","Raj: Hi."
"5","Howard: She says it’s nice to meet you."
"5","Raj: Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?"
"5","Howard: Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together."
"5","Raj: Okay, I’m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe."
"5","Howard: He’ll text you."
"5","Raj: Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again."
"5","Sheldon: And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!"
"5","Scene: A coffee shop."
"5","Raj: Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I’m cool with it, I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? Oh, no, I bet you didn’t."
"5","Howard: Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan."
"5","Raj: Oh, she’s here."
"5","Howard: No joke. Oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late."
"5","Raj: Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens."
"5","Howard: Really? That’s the first thing you want to say?"
"5","Raj: I worked on it all night. Use it."
"5","Howard: Look, I don’t know the sign for opalescent."
"5","Raj: Then spell it."
"5","Howard: I don’t know how to spell it."
"5","Raj: You’re blowing this for me!"
"5","Howard: He likes your eyes."
"5","Raj: You’re making me sound like a caveman."
"5","Howard: She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”"
"5","Raj: Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too."
"5","Howard: No."
"5","Raj: Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones."
"5","Howard: She doesn’t know what James Earl Jones sounds like."
"5","Raj: Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying."
"5","Scene: The same, later."
"5","Raj: Let’s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?"
"5","Howard: You really want to ask her that?"
"5","Raj: You’re right. Everyone loves music."
"5","Howard: She says, do you play an instrument?"
"5","Raj: No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants."
"5","Howard: Do you hear yourself"
"5","Raj: Yes, but she doesn’t. So get signing, hand monkey."
"5","Howard (translating for Emily): I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon."
"5","Raj: What are you doing?"
"5","Howard: Texting Bernadette that I’m gonna be late."
"5","Raj: Dude, what is she saying?"
"5","Howard: It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling."
"5","Raj: What? Why?"
"5","Howard: The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!"
"5","Scene: Outside the coffee shop."
"5","Raj: It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there."
"5","Howard: Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime."
"5","Raj: Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?"
"5","Howard: I speak sign language, I don’t read minds."
"5","Raj: If you were me, would you kiss her?"
"5","Howard: Yeah, but I’m a make out king. (She kisses Raj and gets into car)"
"5","Raj: I was so smooth on that date."
"5","Howard: You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot."
"5","Raj: Whatever, dude. She kissed me."
"5","Howard: It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss."
"5","Raj: Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us."
"5","Howard: Okay."
"5","Penny: Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave."
"5","Howard: Why are you still doing this?"
"5","Sheldon: Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle."
"5","Leonard: You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants."
"5","Sheldon: The dice giveth and the dice taketh away."
"5","Penny: Is Raj out with Emily again?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah, every night for the last month."
"5","Penny: Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend."
"5","Sheldon (rolls dice): Me neither."
"5","Howard: Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car."
"5","Penny: You’re kidding."
"5","Leonard: You think she’s taking advantage of him?"
"5","Penny: Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf."
"5","Leonard: Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?"
"5","Penny: Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
"5","Leonard: Could you tell us?"
"5","Sheldon: Let’s see. (Rolls dice) Snake eyes. Sorry, bud."
"5","Penny: Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again."
"5","Sheldon: Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy."
"5","Penny: What do you mean, vastly wealthy?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up."
"5","Leonard: Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much."
"5","Sheldon: No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich."
"5","Penny: Well, so how much is that?"
"5","Sheldon: About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck."
"5","Howard: What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro."
"5","Leonard: Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much."
"5","Penny: Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car."
"5","Howard: And she got him to pay off all her credit cards."
"5","Penny: What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj."
"5","Howard: He’s not going to listen, he’s in love."
"5","Sheldon: Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to… (rolls dice) stay right here."
"5","Scene: The gym."
"5","Howard: Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go."
"5","Penny: No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something."
"5","Howard: Wow."
"5","Penny: You’re engaged to my friend."
"5","Howard: Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage."
"5","Penny: I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes."
"5","Howard: Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you."
"5","Penny: Hi."
"5","Howard (translating): Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you."
"5","Penny: Um, can we talk to you about Raj?"
"5","Howard: She says, sure, what about him?"
"5","Penny: Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying."
"5","Howard: Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment. She answers the door."
"5","Raj: I’m so mad at you!"
"5","Penny: Okay, wait…"
"5","Raj: How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!"
"5","Penny: We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?"
"5","Raj: I’m hammered."
"5","Penny: Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?"
"5","Raj: The best one I ever had!"
"5","Penny: Okay, come on. You know you can do better."
"5","Raj: Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman."
"5","Penny: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"5","Raj: It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings."
"5","Penny: I don’t have feelings."
"5","Raj: Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that. (Storms out)"
"5","Penny: He is cuter now that I know he’s rich."
"5","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"5","Raj: I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. (Skype tone from computer) Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: No, it’s not a nice surprise, it’s a bad surprise."
"5","Mrs Koothrappali: Penny called us."
"5","Raj: Penny?"
"5","Mrs Koothrappali: She told us you’re spending all our money on your new girlfriend."
"5","Raj: I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: Yeah, yeah, I’m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you."
"5","Mrs Koothrappali: You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you’re cut off."
"5","Raj: What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?"
"5","Dr Koothrappali: It’s up to you."
"5","Raj: Well, I choose love."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: Hah. You’re an idiot. Love doesn’t last. Well, he’s going to find out eventually. Think about it."
"5","Raj: My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. (She signs) No, I think we’ll have to return the car. (Again) And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love."
"5","Raj: Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad."
"5","Penny: I know, I know."
"5","Raj: Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying."
"5","Penny: Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better."
"5","Raj: Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?"
"5","Penny: What? No!"
"5","Raj: Look, Penny, you’re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati."
"5","Raj: Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though I can’t have sex with you."
"5","Howard: Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds."
"5","Sheldon: Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
"5","Penny: Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready."
"5","Howard: Thanks for dinner, buddy."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, real big of you."
"5","Sheldon: Hurry, hurry, hurry."
"5","Penny: Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now."
"5","Series 05 Episode 05 – The Russian Rocket Reaction"
"5","Scene: The comic book store."
"5","Leonard: It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?"
"5","Sheldon: I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?"
"5","Leonard: What did you have in mind?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England."
"5","Leonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop."
"5","Sheldon: Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England."
"5","Leonard: Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?"
"5","Sheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?"
"5","Leonard: Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there."
"5","Sheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it."
"5","Stuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure."
"5","Leonard: Yeah. It’s okay, I guess."
"5","Sheldon: Okay? It’s magnificent."
"5","Leonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?"
"5","Stuart: Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s say 250?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, that’s pretty steep."
"5","Stuart: Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys."
"5","Sheldon: Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it."
"5","Leonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?"
"5","Stuart: Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and family discount."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it."
"5","Leonard: Slow down. Two hundred."
"5","Sheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price."
"5","Leonard: Will you shut up?"
"5","Stuart: Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five."
"5","Leonard: Nope. Maybe another time."
"5","Stuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer."
"5","Sheldon: Take it, take it."
"5","Leonard: Two hundred."
"5","Stuart: Man, you’re killing me!"
"5","Sheldon: Killing you? I can’t breathe."
"5","Stuart: Two ten, and I’m losing money."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry."
"5","Leonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet."
"5","Stuart: Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey Jr."
"5","Leonard: So?"
"5","Stuart: Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!"
"5","Leonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten."
"5","Stuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week."
"5","Leonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks."
"5","Sheldon: I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
"5","Stuart: You want me to wrap it?"
"5","Leonard: No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest."
"5","Wil Wheaton (entering): Hey, Stuart."
"5","Stuart: Ah, hey, Wil."
"5","Sheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton."
"5","Wil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword."
"5","Sheldon: It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?"
"5","Wil: No."
"5","Sheldon: I’m not surprised."
"5","Stuart: Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted."
"5","Wil: Awesome. What do I owe you?"
"5","Stuart: Forty bucks."
"5","Wil: Good deal."
"5","Sheldon: Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount."
"5","Wil: Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by."
"5","Stuart: Will there be girls there?"
"5","Wil: Yeah, of course."
"5","Stuart: ‘Cause there wasn’t last time."
"5","Wil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by."
"5","Leonard: Thank you."
"5","Wil: All right, great. Later."
"5","Sheldon: I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever."
"5","Leonard: I was actually thinking about going."
"5","Sheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it."
"5","Leonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time."
"5","Stuart: Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?"
"5","Sheldon: Possibly."
"5","Leonard: Can you or can’t you?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s not that simple, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: It never is, is it?"
"5","Sheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship."
"5","Leonard: Got it. Can I have my water?"
"5","Sheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor."
"5","Penny: Wait, what is going on?"
"5","Sheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…"
"5","Penny: No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there."
"5","Amy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?"
"5","Howard (arriving): Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring."
"5","All: Wow."
"5","Bernadette: Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!"
"5","Howard: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is."
"5","Sheldon: Mohammed Lee."
"5","Howard: Who’s Mohammed Lee?"
"5","Sheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge."
"5","Howard: It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut."
"5","All: Wow, that’s amazing!"
"5","Bernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?"
"5","Howard: Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market."
"5","Bernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?"
"5","Howard: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl."
"5","Leonard: I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you."
"5","All: Cheers."
"5","Sheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos."
"5","Sheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me."
"5","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"5","Howard: You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?"
"5","Bernadette: Fine. Just a little tired."
"5","Howard: I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift."
"5","Bernadette: I always catch your drift."
"5","Howard: All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?"
"5","Bernadette: I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me."
"5","Howard: Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home."
"5","Bernadette: Just stop talking, Howard."
"5","Howard: This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut."
"5","Bernadette: What did you think was going to happen?"
"5","Howard: Honestly? Sex."
"5","Bernadette: Howard."
"5","Howard: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?"
"5","Bernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team."
"5","Howard: I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it."
"5","Bernadette: Okay."
"5","Howard: I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?"
"5","Bernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process."
"5","Howard: Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?"
"5","Bernadette: No."
"5","Howard: No?"
"5","Howard: Well why not?"
"5","Bernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you."
"5","Howard: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!"
"5","Leonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?"
"5","Sheldon: Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy."
"5","Leonard: For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff."
"5","Sheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?"
"5","Leonard: You never stop talking, do you?"
"5","Amy: I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?"
"5","Penny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy."
"5","Amy: Mortal enemy?"
"5","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?"
"5","Sheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?"
"5","Penny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no."
"5","Sheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy."
"5","Amy: A floppy disk?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine."
"5","Amy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?"
"5","All: Oh! Oh, God!"
"5","Sheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list."
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"5","Bernadette: Howard?"
"5","Howard: Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it."
"5","Bernadette: No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams."
"5","Howard: Really?"
"5","Bernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it."
"5","Howard: Thank you."
"5","Bernadette: I love you."
"5","Howard: I love you, too. So, sex now?"
"5","Bernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back. (Exits)"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!"
"5","Bernadette: I’m ready."
"5","Scene: The cafeteria."
"5","Leonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?"
"5","Howard: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me."
"5","Raj: Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star."
"5","Howard: Little bit."
"5","Leonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
"5","Sheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself."
"5","Leonard: Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for."
"5","Leonard: I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!"
"5","Sheldon: Not yet."
"5","Raj: So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?"
"5","Howard: I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions."
"5","Raj: Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space."
"5","Howard: Obviously."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Bernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?"
"5","Amy: You’re kidding."
"5","Penny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book."
"5","Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this."
"5","Penny: Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?"
"5","Bernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?"
"5","Amy: It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize."
"5","Penny: Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question."
"5","Bernadette: What?"
"5","Penny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?"
"5","Bernadette: I do, with all my heart."
"5","Penny: Got it. Just had to check."
"5","Amy: He’s great."
"5","Leonard: All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance."
"5","Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers."
"5","Leonard: You want to drive?"
"5","Raj: Sure."
"5","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me."
"5","Leonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party."
"5","Sheldon: Brent Spiner?"
"5","Leonard: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: I don’t care."
"5","Leonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him."
"5","Sheldon: I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey."
"5","Leonard: I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, Bernadette’s here!"
"5","Howard: Tell her I’m not home!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!"
"5","Bernadette: Can we talk?"
"5","Howard: You can. I have nothing to say."
"5","Bernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother."
"5","Howard: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back."
"5","Bernadette: I know. I’m sorry. I got scared."
"5","Howard: If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil."
"5","Bernadette: I know."
"5","Howard: Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean."
"5","Bernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean."
"5","Howard: Well, those big kids were rocking it."
"5","Bernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle."
"5","Bernadette: You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me."
"5","Howard: Right, right."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!"
"5","Scene: Wil Wheaton’s party."
"5","Raj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah."
"5","Raj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!"
"5","Leonard: What are you doing here?"
"5","Sheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home."
"5","Wil: Hey, Sheldon, I’m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like."
"5","Sheldon: What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely."
"5","Wil: This is for you."
"5","Sheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure."
"5","Wil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn’t show up."
"5","Wil: Look at what I wrote."
"5","Sheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton."
"5","Wil: It’s my last one. I want you to have it."
"5","Sheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!"
"5","Brent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven’t seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?"
"5","Sheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton."
"5","Brent: Sorry, Slim. I’ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?"
"5","Sheldon: You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy."
"5","Wil: Don’t worry. It doesn’t take up a whole lot of your time."
"5","Sheldon: Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house."
"5","Leonard: Can we get autographed dolls?"
"5","Brent: Sure. Twenty bucks."
"5","Leonard: Ten."
"5","Brent: Eighteen."
"5","Leonard: Twelve."
"5","Brent: Sixteen."
"5","Leonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party."
"5","Brent: Done."
"5","Series 05 Episode 06 – The Rhinitis Revelation"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon’s mother is visiting."
"5","Leonard: So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?"
"5","Mrs Cooper: It’s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you’d come with me, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles."
"5","Mrs Cooper: You’re missing out. It’s gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It’s all themed. There’s Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God."
"5","Leonard: What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire ’em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord’s forgiveness."
"5","Sheldon: Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
"5","Mrs Cooper: For example, if Shelly was aboard, he’d write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!"
"5","Sheldon: The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Sounds delicious."
"5","Sheldon: Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook."
"5","Sheldon: Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Actually, I wouldn’t mind going out for a bite, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?"
"5","Leonard: All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street."
"5","Mrs Cooper: I’ve never had it, but there’s no harm in trying something new."
"5","Sheldon: There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he’s fine."
"5","Sheldon: Told you."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston."
"5","Credits Sequence."
"5","Scene: A sushi bar."
"5","All: Irasshaimase!"
"5","Sheldon: Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this."
"5","Leonard: What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?"
"5","Sheldon: The prospect of fried chicken."
"5","Mrs Cooper: This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it’s just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben’s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don’t make it sushi."
"5","Leonard: Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, I thought the one we couldn’t say was ching chong."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, yeah, that, too."
"5","Mrs Cooper: So, Shelly, what’s up with you and your friend Amy, if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Do you have any idea what’s going on with those two?"
"5","Leonard: It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
"5","Mrs Cooper: How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you’re in some sort of a long distance situation?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, that’s a funny turn, isn’t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can’t force things. You need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re just calling it one. It’s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don’t make ’em biscuits."
"5","Sheldon: And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant."
"5","Leonard: Please pester her. Please, for me."
"5","Scene: The stairwell."
"5","Leonard: So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
"5","Mrs Cooper: It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?"
"5","Sheldon: I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo."
"5","Leonard: Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank."
"5","Sheldon: Get them before they get us."
"5","Raj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer): Hey, look who decided to show up."
"5","Leonard: Raj, what are you doing?"
"5","Raj: I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead."
"5","Sheldon: Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother."
"5","Raj: Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Well, it’s so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem."
"5","Leonard: We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?"
"5","Raj: Nothing, I’m fine."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Are ya?"
"5","Raj: No. (Bursts into tears)"
"5","Mrs Cooper: That’s better. Now tell me what’s bothering you."
"5","Raj: I’m so lonely."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Sheldon, your friend is hurtin’. What do we do when someone’s hurtin’?"
"5","Sheldon: Offer them a hot beverage."
"5","Mrs Cooper: And when they’re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?"
"5","Sheldon: Coffee."
"5","Mrs Cooper: And what do we do it with? (Sheldon fixes a large false smile.) Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can’t find someone, but there’s a lock for every key. Back home, there’s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she’d never find a man, then one day, wouldn’t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies."
"5","Raj: I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better."
"5","Sheldon: I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?"
"5","Leonard: You want some Oreos?"
"5","Sheldon: Double Stuf?"
"5","Leonard: No, regular."
"5","Sheldon: Nice. Kick a man when he’s down."
"5","Scene: The laundry room."
"5","Sheldon: I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Sure. One thing you really miss when you’re on vacation is laundry."
"5","Sheldon: Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing."
"5","Sheldon: It is nice, isn’t it?"
"5","Penny (arriving): Mrs. Cooper. Hi!"
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, hello, darlin’."
"5","Penny: Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming."
"5","Sheldon: It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."
"5","Mrs Cooper: So, how’ve you been?"
"5","Penny: Good, good."
"5","Mrs Cooper: I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?"
"5","Penny: Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this? (Holds up a skimpy top)"
"5","Penny: Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost."
"5","Sheldon: Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Hon, you think maybe the reason why you’re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you’re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?"
"5","Penny: Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?"
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, not crazy at all. And don’t beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine."
"5","Sheldon: Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Howard: So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I’ve got a good book you could read."
"5","Howard: Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist."
"5","Mrs Cooper: I bet your mom is really proud of you."
"5","Howard: Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still."
"5","Sheldon: I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A."
"5","Mrs Cooper: I don’t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing."
"5","Sheldon: What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?"
"5","Mrs Cooper: Come on, Sheldon, we’ll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame."
"5","Penny: Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Well, I can’t spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it’s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation."
"5","Howard: What do you say?"
"5","Sheldon: What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it."
"5","Howard (after Raj whispers to him): He’s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine."
"5","Scene: The kitchen."
"5","Leonard: These are delicious."
"5","Mrs Cooper: The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it."
"5","Leonard: Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?"
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we’re not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly."
"5","Sheldon: Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Apology accepted."
"5","Sheldon: Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts."
"5","Mrs Cooper: I am still going out with your friends."
"5","Sheldon: But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don’t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us."
"5","Sheldon: I’m not going, and you can’t make me."
"5","Mrs Cooper: You’re right, I can’t. Have a nice day."
"5","Sheldon: Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Well, then you are going to stand there all day."
"5","Leonard: I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there."
"5","Sheldon: I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me."
"5","Mrs Cooper: I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country."
"5","Sheldon: We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Well, I guess we are."
"5","Leonard: Sorry. Syrup."
"5","Sheldon: All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard’s hand)"
"5","Leonard: I hadn’t…"
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"5","Sheldon: That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)"
"5","Amy: Are you getting sick?"
"5","Sheldon: No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?"
"5","Sheldon: No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
"5","Amy: Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else."
"5","Sheldon: Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?"
"5","Amy: Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He sneezes again) Sure you’re not coming down with a cold?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?"
"5","Scene: A church."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, this one’s sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers."
"5","Leonard: Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers."
"5","Mrs Cooper: My goodness, it’s a wonder you people in California can talk at all."
"5","Penny: This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever."
"5","Leonard: What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches."
"5","Penny: Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?"
"5","Raj (pointing at a crucifixion statue): Hey, none of our gods have abs like that."
"5","Howard: Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Hey, while we’re here, why don’t we all do some praying? Let’s put a little church in this church."
"5","Leonard: Oh, I’m not sure we should."
"5","Mrs Cooper: It’s easy. I’ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn."
"5","Penny: Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool."
"5","Mrs Cooper: She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you’re up. Wasserman, you’re on deck."
"5","Leonard: Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?"
"5","Howard: Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Rajesh?"
"5","Howard: He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing."
"5","Howard: No, you only get one wish."
"5","Scene: A park bench. Sheldon is sitting. A stranger sits next to him."
"5","Sheldon: Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants."
"5","Penny: Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good."
"5","Mrs Cooper: You take notes, darlin’. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He’ll die at 50 but his love will be true."
"5","Sheldon (entering, soaked): I need a tissue.This one got wet."
"5","Leonard: Here."
"5","Sheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. (Sneezes)"
"5","Mrs Cooper: Sweetheart, are you sick?"
"5","Sheldon: I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We’ve got to get you to bed."
"5","Sheldon: Okay."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Don’t worry. Mama’s here to take care of her baby."
"5","Sheldon: And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Of course."
"5","Sheldon: Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?"
"5","Mrs Cooper: You can have whatever you want."
"5","Sheldon: Thanks, Mom.You’re the best."
"5","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn’t have hair on your chest."
"5","Sheldon: I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit."
"5","Mrs Cooper: And whose fault was that?"
"5","Sheldon: Yours."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Shelly, you’re not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship."
"5","Sheldon: No, we don’t. The one we have works great."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Sweetheart, you are a grown man."
"5","Sheldon: Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston."
"5","Sheldon: Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?"
"5","Mrs Cooper: No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
"5","Leonard (at door): Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?"
"5","Sheldon: Get out!"
"5","Mrs Cooper: Well, that was rude."
"5","Sheldon: Well, I know, but he means well. Sing."
"5","Mrs Cooper: Happy kitty, sleepy kitty…"
"5","Sheldon: What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top."
"5","Mrs Cooper (to God): This is what I’m talking about. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
"5","Series 05 Episode 07 – The Good Guy Fluctuation"
"5","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"5","Sheldon: And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock."
"5","Ghostly voice: Sheldon, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Hmm. (Looks outside office door. Corridor lamp sparks and goes out. Corridor is bathed in an eerie glow) All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn."
"5","Ghostly voice: Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. (Reading message on wall) See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. (A luminous skeleton rushes towards him) Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow."
"5","Raj: You should’ve seen your face."
"5","Sheldon: Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
"5","Howard: Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. (Leonard creeps out behind him wearing a Star Trek Balok mask)"
"5","Raj: He’s probably right."
"5","Howard: We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart."
"5","Sheldon: Gentlemen. (Turns and sees Leonard. Screams and faints)."
"5","Howard: Who had money on faints?"
"5","Raj: I had pee his pants."
"5","Leonard: Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The comic book store."
"5","Leonard: Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!"
"5","Sheldon: Droll."
"5","Howard:Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine."
"5","Leonard: That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia."
"5","Sheldon: Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico."
"5","Stuart: Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!"
"5","Raj: What is she doing in a comic book store?"
"5","Stuart: I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi."
"5","Hot girl: Hi."
"5","Stuart: Um… it-it-it… (returns to guys) Shut up."
"5","Hot girl (to Leonard): Are you getting this Next Men?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy."
"5","Hot girl: I know. I’ve been looking for it for years."
"5","Leonard: Sorry."
"5","Hot girl: Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?"
"5","Leonard: Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil."
"5","Hot girl: Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice."
"5","Leonard: Leonard."
"5","Alice: You are very cute, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it."
"5","Alice: No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess."
"5","Alice: Okay. Here. This is my number, call me."
"5","Leonard: Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?"
"5","Alice: Alice."
"5","Leonard: Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis."
"5","Alice: Later."
"5","Howard: Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?"
"5","Stuart: ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes."
"5","Leonard: No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend."
"5","Stuart: Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend."
"5","Scene: Entering the apartment building."
"5","Sheldon: Be sure to check the mail."
"5","Leonard: How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?"
"5","Sheldon: Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality."
"5","Leonard: Right."
"5","Penny: Hey, guys."
"5","Leonard: More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?"
"5","Penny: Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail."
"5","Leonard: Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?"
"5","Sheldon: Open the mail!"
"5","Leonard: Excuse me. (Sheldon holds fingers in ears) A couple of circulars, nothing important."
"5","Penny: What’s with him?"
"5","Leonard: Hang on. (Sheldon opens mail box. A loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard’s face on pops out. Sheldon faints again.) You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Leonard is with Alice."
"5","Leonard: Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con."
"5","Alice: What are you wearing?"
"5","Leonard: Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats."
"5","Alice: Wow, you must have gotten so laid."
"5","Leonard: No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly."
"5","Alice: Want to see a comic I draw?"
"5","Leonard: You’re kidding. You have your own book?"
"5","Alice: Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life."
"5","Leonard: Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?"
"5","Alice: You’d think, but no."
"5","Leonard: You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do… (she kisses him.)"
"5","Alice: So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?"
"5","Leonard: You can have my car."
"5","Sheldon (creeps into office carrying a box): Oh, dear. (Reaches into box, picks up a snake) Oh, dear. (Puts snake into Raj’s top drawer) Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell."
"5","Raj (entering): Good morning, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples."
"5","Raj: You have a thing of paper clips right there."
"5","Sheldon: well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
"5","Raj: I don’t know. Maybe."
"5","Sheldon: Be a lamb and check."
"5","Raj: All right. (Opening drawer) Who do we have here?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s a snake. A terrifying snake."
"5","Raj: Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?"
"5","Sheldon: Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear."
"5","Raj: Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice."
"5","Sheldon: I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment. There is a knock."
"5","Penny: It’s open."
"5","Leonard: Hey, you got a minute?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, sure, come on in."
"5","Leonard: Thanks."
"5","Penny: Want some mac and cheese?"
"5","Leonard: No. Lactose. Gas."
"5","Penny: Glass of wine?"
"5","Leonard: No. Sulfites. Migraines."
"5","Penny: Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?"
"5","Leonard: Okay, we used to go out, right?"
"5","Penny: Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from."
"5","Leonard: I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid."
"5","Penny: All right, what’s going on?"
"5","Leonard: So, you’re okay talking about this?"
"5","Penny: Yes."
"5","Leonard: You’re sure it’s not weird."
"5","Penny: It’s okay."
"5","Leonard: You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that."
"5","Penny: Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point."
"5","Leonard: Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…"
"5","Penny: Yeah, probably."
"5","Leonard: Come on."
"5","Penny: I’m sorry, go ahead."
"5","Leonard: I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common."
"5","Penny: Did you guys do it?"
"5","Leonard: No. We just made out a little."
"5","Penny: Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?"
"5","Leonard: Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth."
"5","Penny: That’s gross."
"5","Leonard: Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman."
"5","Penny: Well, good for you."
"5","Leonard: The problem is, I want to be one of those guys."
"5","Penny: So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya."
"5","Leonard: Oh, that’s not who I am."
"5","Penny: All right, then break it off with the new girl."
"5","Leonard: Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot."
"5","Penny: If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?"
"5","Leonard: Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday."
"5","Penny: Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it."
"5","Leonard: Now we’re getting somewhere."
"5","Penny: What does your gut tell you?"
"5","Leonard: Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is adjusting a device on his arm."
"5","Sheldon: Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. (Grabs his own hand. Electrocutes himself.) Perfect."
"5","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"5","Sheldon: Science. You wouldn’t understand."
"5","Leonard: Hey, well, see you. I’m going out. (Starts to go out. Doesn’t.)"
"5","Sheldon: I thought you were leaving the apartment."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind."
"5","Sheldon: Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?"
"5","Leonard: No. I’m having a moral crisis."
"5","Sheldon: Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss."
"5","Leonard: Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India."
"5","Sheldon: All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on."
"5","Leonard: Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do."
"5","Sheldon: You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men."
"5","Leonard: That actually does help."
"5","Sheldon: It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis."
"5","Leonard: Screw it, I’m going."
"5","Sheldon: On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
"5","Leonard: Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now."
"5","Sheldon: Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?"
"5","Leonard: No."
"5","Sheldon: Great. Tropicana, no pulp."
"5","Scene: Howard’s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell."
"5","Howard: Hey, Sheldon."
"5","Bernadette (off): Who is it?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz."
"5","Howard: That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette."
"5","Sheldon: Really? That’s very unsettling."
"5","Bernadette: Hi, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Hi."
"5","Howard: What’s up?"
"5","Sheldon: It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so."
"5","Howard: Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?"
"5","Sheldon: Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!"
"5","Howard: Whatever. (Takes his hand. Starts to be electrocuted) My… oh… it’s… (Clutches heart and collapses)"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?"
"5","Sheldon: It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look."
"5","Bernadette: Howard has a heart condition! You know that!"
"5","Sheldon: Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?"
"5","Bernadette: This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart."
"5","Sheldon: We are?"
"5","Bernadette: You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, no! I can’t!"
"5","Bernadette: Hurry! We’re running out of time!"
"5","Sheldon: Okay."
"5","Bernadette: Just do it!"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, God! One, two, three!"
"5","Howard: Trick or treat, bubbeleh."
"5","Sheldon: What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… (puts hand to forehead. Electrocutes himself)."
"5","Scene: Alice’s apartment. Alice and Leonard are kissing."
"5","Leonard: Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this."
"5","Alice: Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on."
"5","Leonard: No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to."
"5","Alice: But?"
"5","Leonard: But I kind of have a girlfriend."
"5","Alice: Are you kidding?"
"5","Leonard: You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?"
"5","Alice: I don’t believe this."
"5","Leonard: Wait, I don’t, which part?"
"5","Alice: I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass."
"5","Leonard: Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy."
"5","Scene: Leonard being ejected into the corridor."
"5","Leonard: It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Leonard is on skype."
"5","Leonard: Hey, Priya."
"5","Priya: Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, not so good. We have to talk."
"5","Priya: Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?"
"5","Leonard: Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry."
"5","Priya: Leonard, relax. It’s okay."
"5","Leonard: It is?"
"5","Priya: Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody."
"5","Leonard: Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?"
"5","Priya: Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too."
"5","Leonard: Uh, kind of?"
"5","Priya: A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little."
"5","Leonard: No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot."
"5","Priya: Well, it’s not a competition."
"5","Leonard: Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this."
"5","Sheldon (leaping out of the base of the sofa): Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even."
"5","Series 05 Episode 08 – The Isolation Permutation"
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Penny: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?"
"5","Bernadette: Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great."
"5","Amy: Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems."
"5","Bernadette: Really?"
"5","Amy: Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding."
"5","Bernadette: That’s horrible."
"5","Amy: Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids."
"5","Bernadette: I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh."
"5","Amy: Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters."
"5","Sheldon: Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny."
"5","Leonard: Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?"
"5","Howard: What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?"
"5","Sheldon: I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists."
"5","Penny: Okay, that time you looked at me."
"5","Amy: Who didn’t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?"
"5","Sheldon: Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse."
"5","Penny: All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, me."
"5","Penny: Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving."
"5","Amy: Wait for moi."
"5","Sheldon: You’re leaving?"
"5","Amy: Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body."
"5","Sheldon: Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"
"5","Raj: Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The cafeteria."
"5","Leonard: Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?"
"5","Amy: Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy."
"5","Sheldon: She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease."
"5","Amy: It’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it."
"5","Howard: That’s fun to have in a lunchroom."
"5","Amy: The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week."
"5","Howard: Please, we’re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?"
"5","Sheldon: Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation."
"5","Leonard: This time, it’s your fault."
"5","Sheldon: I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep."
"5","Leonard: Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
"5","Amy: I don’t know, four or five years."
"5","Leonard: No, it’s not gonna do it."
"5","Howard: Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses."
"5","Amy: They’re out shopping right now?"
"5","Howard: Yeah."
"5","Amy: Just the two of them?"
"5","Howard: I guess."
"5","Amy: That’s cool, that’s cool."
"5","Howard: Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? (Raj raises his hand)"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Leonard is horseracing on a Kinnect game."
"5","Leonard: Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up."
"5","Sheldon: What?"
"5","Leonard: Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air."
"5","Sheldon: Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
"5","Leonard: Did you try calling her on the telephone?"
"5","Sheldon: The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser."
"5","Leonard: If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right."
"5","Sheldon: Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood."
"5","Leonard: I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat."
"5","Sheldon: Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?"
"5","Leonard: You do?"
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat."
"5","Leonard: Forget about the bobcat."
"5","Sheldon: How can I? You won’t stop talking about it."
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing the harp."
"5","Amy (singing): Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes."
"5","Sheldon (outside): She sounds weepy. I don’t like weepy. Let’s go."
"5","Leonard: Uh, she’s your friend. Step up."
"5","Leonard: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Bye."
"5","Sheldon: Where are you going?"
"5","Leonard: I’m single, I don’t need this crap."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
"5","Sheldon: You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications."
"5","Amy: I wanted to be alone."
"5","Sheldon: Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me."
"5","Sheldon: Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"
"5","Amy: It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters."
"5","Sheldon: If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
"5","Amy: Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me."
"5","Sheldon: And that made you feel sad?"
"5","Amy: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this."
"5","Amy: It’s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself."
"5","Sheldon: When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, I’m going to ask you something, and I’d like you to keep an open mind."
"5","Sheldon: Always."
"5","Amy: At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind."
"5","Amy: Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins."
"5","Sheldon: Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy."
"5","Amy: How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base."
"5","Sheldon: Neck massage, then you get me that beverage."
"5","Amy: We cuddle. Final offer."
"5","Sheldon: Very well. Oh, boy. (They cuddle, awkwardly.)"
"5","Amy: I’m just saying, second base is right there."
"5","Raj: Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache."
"5","Leonard: For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?"
"5","Raj: This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here."
"5","Sheldon: The two of you need to get your women in line!"
"5","Howard: What?"
"5","Sheldon: Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time."
"5","Howard: What do you want us to do about it?"
"5","Sheldon: You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!"
"5","Leonard: Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend."
"5","Sheldon: You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!"
"5","Leonard: Moo-shu is Penny."
"5","Penny: Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."
"5","Bernadette: That’s so sweet."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
"5","Howard: So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She’s kind of upset."
"5","Penny: Why?"
"5","Leonard: Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her."
"5","Bernadette: I told you that would happen."
"5","Penny: Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it."
"5","Bernadette: She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other."
"5","Penny: Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers"
"5","Bernadette: We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible."
"5","Penny: I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?"
"5","Howard: Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I’m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn’t thinking."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, Howie."
"5","Howard: Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it."
"5","Penny: What do you tell him?"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about."
"5","Leonard: Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
"5","Penny: No. All your little secrets are fine."
"5","Bernadette: Yes, absolutely fine."
"5","Howard (after Raj whispers to him): I’ll tell you later."
"5","Scene: Amy’s lab. Amy is dissecting a brain."
"5","Amy: Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news."
"5","Penny: Hi."
"5","Bernadette: Hello."
"5","Amy: What are you doing here?"
"5","Penny: Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day."
"5","Amy: That’s not necessary, it’s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone."
"5","Penny: Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want."
"5","Bernadette: We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other."
"5","Penny: With-with loofah mitts, no hands."
"5","Amy: It’s okay. I’m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-"
"5","the-right-light friend want to hang out with me."
"5","Bernadette: Amy, we’re really sorry."
"5","Penny: Yeah, we feel awful."
"5","Amy: Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again."
"5","Penny: Oh, come on, Amy."
"5","Amy: You don’t get it. Look at this brain."
"5","Penny: I don’t really want to."
"5","Amy: This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with."
"5","Bernadette: Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not a tumour. (Penny is vomiting in the dustbin)."
"5","Scene: The apartment, Sheldon is building his Lego Death Star. Phone rings."
"5","Sheldon: Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way."
"5","Leonard: What’s going on?"
"5","Sheldon: It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot."
"5","Leonard: Really? Amy?"
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful."
"5","Scene: A liquor store parking lot."
"5","Amy: Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Hi, Amy."
"5","Amy: Hey, Cuddles."
"5","Leonard: Cuddles?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Amy, what are you doing here?"
"5","Amy: Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you’re sad."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?"
"5","Amy: Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me."
"5","Leonard: Maybe we should get you home."
"5","Amy: Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go."
"5","Leonard: Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy."
"5","Amy: Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base."
"5","Scene: Amy’s lab. She is dissecting a brain."
"5","Amy: I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too."
"5","Amy: What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?"
"5","Penny: I never gave you a friendship bracelet."
"5","Amy: When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want."
"5","Penny: No, you made that for you, I want you to have it."
"5","Bernadette: We know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right."
"5","Penny: We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you."
"5","Bernadette: Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding."
"5","Amy: What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?"
"5","Bernadette: No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour."
"5","Amy: Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all died."
"5","Bernadette: So is that a yes?"
"5","Amy: Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we’ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette’s naked body. So that’s happening."
"5","Penny: Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too."
"5","Amy: I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?"
"5","Penny: Sorry."
"5","Amy: Really?"
"5","Penny: Okay, yeah."
"5","Amy: Yay!"
"5","Scene: A bridal store."
"5","Amy: Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one."
"5","Bernadette: We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?"
"5","Amy: I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?"
"5","Bernadette: I am the bride."
"5","Amy: So no. And action."
"5","Penny (in a red bridesmaid dress): What do you think?"
"5","Bernadette: I love it!"
"5","Amy: What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let’s see some skin."
"5","Cut to Amy in a lilac dress."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!"
"5","Amy: You think they don’t have mirrors in there? I know how I look."
"5","Cut to Bernadette in a wedding dress."
"5","Penny: Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!"
"5","Amy: You do."
"5","Bernadette: Thank you."
"5","Amy: Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful."
"5","Cut to changing room door."
"5","Amy: Come on, bestie, you’re up."
"5","Penny (off): Give me a minute."
"5","Amy: What is taking you so long? (Opens door. Penny is in her underwear)"
"5","Penny: Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!"
"5","Amy: – Sorry, sorry. (Swings camera away. Then back again)"
"5","Penny: Oh, God. Amy!"
"5","Amy: Sorry."
"5","Series 05 Episode 09 – The Ornithophobia Diffusion"
"5","Scene: The lobby."
"5","Penny: Hey."
"5","Leonard: Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?"
"5","Penny: Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?"
"5","Leonard: Not really."
"5","Penny: Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?"
"5","Leonard: Star Wars on Blu-ray."
"5","Penny: Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?"
"5","Leonard: Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray."
"5","Penny: Oh, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: I know, it’s high-resolution sadness."
"5","Penny: Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?"
"5","Leonard: Really? Do we do that?"
"5","Penny: What do you mean?"
"5","Leonard: You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up."
"5","Penny: Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night."
"5","Leonard: Sounds like most of my dates."
"5","Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach): Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!"
"5","Penny: What is that about?"
"5","Leonard: Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the window.)"
"5","Sheldon: Shoo, shoo! Be gone!"
"5","Leonard: What the hell is going on?"
"5","Sheldon: There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo."
"5","Penny: Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets."
"5","Penny: So movies, yes or no?"
"5","Leonard: Movies, yes."
"5","Penny: Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him."
"5","Sheldon: That doesn’t help."
"5","Penny: No, I was talking to the bird."
"5","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, just ignore him."
"5","Sheldon: Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The apartment.Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away making cat noises."
"5","Leonard: The bird’s still there?"
"5","Sheldon: Quick, what does a hawk sound like?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know. Scree-scree."
"5","Sheldon: Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help."
"5","Leonard: Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?"
"5","Sheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins."
"5","Leonard: I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date."
"5","Sheldon: Do you think it’s a date?"
"5","Leonard: No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t."
"5","Sheldon: Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t."
"5","Leonard: Are we overthinking this?"
"5","Sheldon: Not at all."
"5","Leonard: You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this."
"5","Sheldon: Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?"
"5","Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap): Too casual?"
"5","Sheldon: For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.) What am I thinking? Whiskers!"
"5","Scene: The cinema."
"5","Penny: Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie."
"5","Leonard: Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America."
"5","Penny: Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam."
"5","Leonard: Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets."
"5","Penny: Okay."
"5","Leonard: Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see."
"5","Penny: You pick plenty of movies."
"5","Leonard: No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along."
"5","Penny: But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes."
"5","Leonard: I hate those movies."
"5","Penny: No, you don’t."
"5","Leonard: Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."
"5","Penny: Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"
"5","Leonard: All the time."
"5","Penny: You’re kidding."
"5","Leonard: Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?"
"5","Penny: Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway."
"5","Leonard: Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?"
"5","Penny: No. No woman would."
"5","Leonard: See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert."
"5","Penny: All right, fine."
"5","Leonard: Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Raj: Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars."
"5","Howard: I’m pushing play."
"5","Sheldon: A minute."
"5","Howard: If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again."
"5","Sheldon: This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator."
"5","Howard: I have a Masters degree from M.I.T."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important."
"5","Raj: I really don’t get your problem with birds."
"5","Sheldon: The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup."
"5","Raj: Hummingbirds are pretty."
"5","Sheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world."
"5","Raj: Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth."
"5","Sheldon: Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?"
"5","Raj: Yes, please. This is way better than the movie."
"5","Howard: All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready."
"5","Sheldon: It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn’t move.)"
"5","Raj: That is one tough birdie."
"5","Scene: A bar."
"5","Leonard: Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
"5","Penny: No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t."
"5","Leonard: I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?"
"5","Penny: Uh, no, thanks."
"5","Leonard: Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries."
"5","Penny: I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like."
"5","Leonard: No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?"
"5","Penny: To get sex."
"5","Leonard: Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?"
"5","Penny: All right, I’d like an order of fries."
"5","Leonard: Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this."
"5","Penny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her): Oh, sorry."
"5","Man: No problem."
"5","Penny: What you writing there?"
"5","Man: A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay."
"5","Penny: I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie."
"5","Man: It’s a working title."
"5","Penny: Oh."
"5","Man: I’m Kevin."
"5","Penny: Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you."
"5","Kevin: I’ll let you get back to your date."
"5","Penny: Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, right."
"5","Penny: So have you written anything I might have seen?"
"5","Kevin: That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?"
"5","Sheldon: This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay. (Opens window) That’s a pretty big blue jay. (Closes window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his place) No!"
"5","Scene: The bar."
"5","Penny (to Kevin): So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment."
"5","Leonard: You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?"
"5","Penny: Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?"
"5","Kevin: No problem."
"5","Penny: What’s up?"
"5","Leonard: I know what you’re doing."
"5","Penny: What am I doing?"
"5","Leonard: You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date."
"5","Penny: No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute."
"5","Leonard: Come on, he’s not that cute."
"5","Penny: Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses."
"5","Leonard: I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses."
"5","Penny: Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically."
"5","Leonard: If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?"
"5","Penny: You should."
"5","Leonard: I’m serious. I’ll do it."
"5","Penny: Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?"
"5","Leonard: They’re in a group. I’m scared."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?"
"5","Sheldon: You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking."
"5","Bernadette: I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains."
"5","Amy: Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
"5","Bernadette: Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet."
"5","Sheldon: No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, he’s a sweetie."
"5","Sheldon: Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman."
"5","Sheldon: Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic."
"5","Bernadette: Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!"
"5","Sheldon: I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him."
"5","Woman: So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?"
"5","Leonard: Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie."
"5","Penny: Hey. Sorry I ditched you."
"5","Leonard: No, it’s fine. You can ditch away."
"5","Penny: Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out."
"5","Leonard: It’s cool. Go back to Kevin."
"5","Penny: Oh, he had to leave."
"5","Leonard: Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me."
"5","Woman: This must be Penny."
"5","Leonard: Yep."
"5","Woman: I totally get it."
"5","Penny: Huh? I’m sorry, get what?"
"5","Leonard: Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them."
"5","Penny: No, no. I want to know what you told her."
"5","Leonard: That’s kind of between me and…"
"5","Woman: Laura."
"5","Leonard: Laura."
"5","Penny: Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?"
"5","Laura: Really?"
"5","Penny: Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween."
"5","Leonard: Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter."
"5","Penny: Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…"
"5","Laura: Laura."
"5","Penny: Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated."
"5","Leonard: When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?"
"5","Penny: Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, yeah? Spell asthma."
"5","Penny: A… S… Take me home."
"5","Leonard: Maybe I’m not done hanging out with… (Laura has gone) You’re right, it’s getting late."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has the bird on his arm."
"5","Sheldon: It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control."
"5","Sheldon: My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?"
"5","Amy: Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here."
"5","Bernadette: I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters."
"5","Sheldon: Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
"5","Amy: If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical."
"5","Sheldon: Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD? (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone."
"5","Amy: I’m sorry, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!"
"5","Scene: The stairwell. They ascend without talking."
"5","Leonard: Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night."
"5","Penny: Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass."
"5","Leonard: I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry."
"5","Penny: All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too."
"5","Leonard: Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
"5","Penny: Way off."
"5","Leonard: Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends."
"5","Penny: I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky."
"5","Leonard: Really?"
"5","Penny: Yeah."
"5","Leonard: Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?"
"5","Penny: Ooh. Maybe I like it."
"5","Leonard: You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be."
"5","Penny: Good night, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night."
"5","Sheldon: Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest with an egg in it.)"
"5","Series 05 Episode 10 – The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition"
"5","Scene: The comic book store."
"5","Howard: It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally."
"5","Leonard: It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
"5","Howard: Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay."
"5","Sheldon: Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?"
"5","Amy: Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o."
"5","Sheldon: Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool."
"5","Stuart: Can I help you find anything?"
"5","Amy: A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device."
"5","Stuart: Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs."
"5","Raj: Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out."
"5","Howard: A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid."
"5","Raj: They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"
"5","Howard: Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?"
"5","Raj: A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand."
"5","Leonard: Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?"
"5","Howard: What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?"
"5","Stuart: Leonard, what’s the deal with Sheldon’s friend Amy? Are they a couple?"
"5","Leonard: Couple of weirdos. Why?"
"5","Howard: You interested in Amy?"
"5","Stuart: Well, I mean, she didn’t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?"
"5","Leonard: Sure. I guess."
"5","Raj: Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?"
"5","Stuart: If I tell you that, I’m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin’ tootin’ low price of $24.95."
"5","Raj: I’ll take one."
"5","Howard: Mmm, make it two."
"5","Leonard: I hate all of you and myself. Three."
"5","Stuart: I’ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Leonard: Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward."
"5","Sheldon: I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
"5","Leonard: No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out."
"5","Sheldon: I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know."
"5","Leonard: You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out."
"5","Sheldon: The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
"5","Leonard: All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it."
"5","Sheldon: Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist."
"5","Leonard: I am not washed-up."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Penny: Well, ladies, we killed the bottle."
"5","Amy: I had half a glass."
"5","Bernadette: I didn’t have any."
"5","Penny: Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"
"5","Amy: Or we play Travel Twister."
"5","Bernadette: Amy, really? Twister?"
"5","Amy: Excuse me. I’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I’m shirts. Called it."
"5","Bernadette: I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
"5","Penny: Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God."
"5","Amy (reading a text on her phone): Guys, something happened."
"5","Penny: What’s wrong?"
"5","Amy: I think a boy likes me."
"5","Bernadette (reading): Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. It’s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft."
"5","Penny: Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester."
"5","Bernadette: What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?"
"5","Penny: Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?"
"5","Amy: I don’t know. He’s nice. He’s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That’s kind of hot."
"5","Penny: Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
"5","Bernadette: Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie."
"5","Penny: Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there."
"5","Sheldon: Where’s Stuart?"
"5","Speccy Guy Behind Counter (sniggering): Out."
"5","Sheldon: Who are you?"
"5","Speccy Guy: I’m Dale. He left me in charge."
"5","Leonard: Really?"
"5","Dale: Yeah. I don’t get it, either."
"5","Leonard: I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack."
"5","Dale: Sorry. I don’t do returns. They’re hard."
"5","Leonard: Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?"
"5","Dale: I don’t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I guess I was wrong."
"5","Leonard: You okay?"
"5","Sheldon: Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?"
"5","Dale: I’m okay, too!"
"5","Scene: The apartment. They are playing Warlords of Ka’a."
"5","Raj: Wild Bill Witchcock."
"5","Leonard: A tribe of Abra-Comanches."
"5","Sheldon: Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. (Spits into a spittoon) Patooie."
"5","Howard: We’re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous."
"5","Sheldon: And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah."
"5","Howard: Very."
"5","Raj: Incredibly so."
"5","Sheldon: Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?"
"5","Sheldon: All right, fine. Let’s just play."
"5","Leonard: We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight."
"5","Howard: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?"
"5","Sheldon: Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?"
"5","Howard: Sorry. Creepy Tepee."
"5","Raj: Annie Ogly."
"5","Leonard: Hocus Pocus Pocahontas."
"5","Sheldon: And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. (Walks away with spurs jangling)"
"5","Leonard: It’s you."
"5","Howard: You are."
"5","Raj: Totally you."
"5","Scene: The cafeteria."
"5","Raj: Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin."
"5","Leonard: Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack."
"5","Howard: Ooh, a sheriff’s badge."
"5","Raj: Yeah, it’s also a wand."
"5","Leonard: With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything."
"5","Leonard: You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?"
"5","Howard: I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore."
"5","Sheldon: Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact."
"5","Raj: Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went."
"5","Sheldon: Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?"
"5","Raj: You’re so full of it."
"5","Sheldon: You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali."
"5","Raj: You unfriended me? Seriously?"
"5","Howard: Oh, yeah. Now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can’t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?"
"5","Sheldon: And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter."
"5","Howard: Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed."
"5","Sheldon: And unfriend Howard Wolowitz."
"5","Leonard: That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?"
"5","Sheldon: Why?"
"5","Leonard: I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment door. Sheldon knocks three times."
"5","Penny (off): Who do we love?"
"5","Sheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)"
"5","Sheldon: Penny."
"5","Penny: Hello, Sheldon. Come on in."
"5","Sheldon: Thank you."
"5","Penny: What’s up?"
"5","Sheldon: I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me."
"5","Penny: I’m sorry, what?"
"5","Sheldon: A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight."
"5","Penny: God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
"5","Sheldon: No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight."
"5","Penny: Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back."
"5","Sheldon: I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
"5","Penny: All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?"
"5","Sheldon: I believe I do."
"5","Penny: Mm."
"5","Sheldon: I’m the guy."
"5","Penny: You’re not the guy."
"5","Sheldon: Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
"5","Penny: I call everyone sweetie."
"5","Sheldon: You tramp."
"5","Penny: Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy."
"5","Sheldon: Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?"
"5","Penny: Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
"5","Scene: A cinema."
"5","Stuart: If you’re bored, you can go. I understand."
"5","Amy: No, I’m having a nice time."
"5","Stuart: Don’t patronize me."
"5","Sheldon: Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart."
"5","Stuart: Hi, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Pardon me. Excuse me."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
"5","Sheldon: The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart."
"5","Stuart: None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word."
"5","Amy: I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
"5","Stuart: Um, again…"
"5","Sheldon: Stuart, please. You’re being rude."
"5","Amy: Anything else?"
"5","Sheldon: I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship."
"5","Amy: I’m listening."
"5","Sheldon: With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend."
"5","Amy: Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative."
"5","Sheldon: You’re being impossible."
"5","Amy: Hi, Stuart."
"5","Sheldon: Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?"
"5","Amy: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids."
"5","Scene: Outside Amy’s apartment."
"5","Stuart: So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice."
"5","Amy: Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door."
"5","Stuart: Oh, you’re welcome."
"5","Sheldon (inside): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Let’s wrap things up out there."
"5","Amy: Um, good night, Stuart."
"5","Stuart: Good night."
"5","Sheldon (inside): Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night."
"5","Amy: How did you get into my apartment?"
"5","Sheldon: Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up."
"5","Amy: What’s that?"
"5","Sheldon: I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend."
"5","Amy: It’s so romantic."
"5","Sheldon: Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp."
"5","Amy: Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive."
"5","Sheldon: Feel free to retain a lawyer."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment. The girls are playing twister."
"5","Amy: Penny, I said right hand red."
"5","Penny (picking up wine): Yeah, I heard you. I got red."
"5","Amy: Bernadette, left foot yellow."
"5","Bernadette: We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo."
"5","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette."
"5","Amy: That’s my boyfriend. It’s open!"
"5","Sheldon: I got a splinter."
"5","Amy: What do you want me to do about it?"
"5","Sheldon: Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it."
"5","Amy: I should’ve gotten a lawyer."
"5","Bernadette: Looks like it’s just us playing. (Penny snores) Penny? (Penny snores louder) Penny, we’re out of wine!"
"5","Penny (waking, bleary): You should probably drive."
"5","Series 05 Episode 11 – The Speckerman Recurrence"
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Penny (entering): Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces."
"5","Penny: Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?"
"5","Sheldon: I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day."
"5","Leonard: You want to hear something weird?"
"5","Penny: Sure."
"5","Sheldon: In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter."
"5","Leonard: What are you talking about?"
"5","Sheldon: You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her."
"5","Sheldon: Oh. I thought it was a game."
"5","Penny: What’s yours?"
"5","Leonard: There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks."
"5","Sheldon: Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick."
"5","Leonard: Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go."
"5","Penny: Basketball Pope."
"5","Sheldon: And that’s how it’s done."
"5","Penny: What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know."
"5","Sheldon: Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?"
"5","Leonard: No, that was a different guy."
"5","Sheldon: Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
"5","Leonard: No, that was a different, different guy."
"5","Sheldon: Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?"
"5","Leonard: No."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?"
"5","Leonard: No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister."
"5","Penny: All right, well, what do you think he wants?"
"5","Sheldon: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there."
"5","Leonard: I told you. That was a different guy."
"5","Penny: Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Leonard: It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?"
"5","Sheldon: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm."
"5","Leonard: Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year."
"5","Sheldon: Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there."
"5","Leonard: Thanks."
"5","Sheldon: So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?"
"5","Leonard: I didn’t have clams."
"5","Sheldon: I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do."
"5","Leonard: It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces."
"5","Sheldon: Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?"
"5","Leonard: You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it."
"5","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"5","Bernadette: I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?"
"5","Penny: ‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully."
"5","Penny: Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes."
"5","Amy: When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?"
"5","Penny: Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose."
"5","Bernadette: I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker."
"5","Penny: Oh, that’s awful."
"5","Bernadette: Worst part was, it was too big."
"5","Amy: That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler."
"5","Penny: Wow. You poor thing."
"5","Bernadette: What about you?"
"5","Penny: Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies."
"5","Amy: Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?"
"5","Penny: No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, my God, that’s awful."
"5","Penny: No, it was funny. Everyone laughed."
"5","Amy: Did Kathy Geiger laugh?"
"5","Penny: Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."
"5","Amy: Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?"
"5","Penny: What? I was not a bully."
"5","Bernadette: Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon."
"5","Amy: Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield."
"5","Scene: A bar."
"5","Raj: Is that him over there?"
"5","Raj: How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you."
"5","Leonard: You know, I can really do this by myself."
"5","Howard: Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy."
"5","Leonard: No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head."
"5","Howard: You wore underwear? You fool."
"5","Raj: So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?"
"5","Leonard: You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school."
"5","Howard: That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?"
"5","Leonard: Scrotum."
"5","Raj: What’s that one?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, stapled."
"5","Jimmy (arriving): Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Oh, hi."
"5","Jimmy: Holy crap, man, it’s good to see you."
"5","Leonard: Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard."
"5","Jimmy: Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you’re a big-time scientist now."
"5","Sheldon: And there’s the first zinger. Ouch."
"5","Leonard: I’m doing okay, I guess."
"5","Jimmy: Okay? Come on, I read online you’re a physicist at a university, you won some medal."
"5","Leonard: The Newcomb medal."
"5","Jimmy: Yeah, congratulations."
"5","Sheldon: Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework."
"5","Jimmy: From what I read, it sounded like a big deal."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?"
"5","Raj: Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too."
"5","Sheldon: My point."
"5","Jimmy: You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot."
"5","Jimmy: Yeah. We were practically a comedy team."
"5","Howard: Like the Black Death and Europe."
"5","Leonard: Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
"5","Jimmy: Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line."
"5","Sheldon: Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey."
"5","Leonard: What’s the idea?"
"5","Jimmy: This is just between us, right?"
"5","Leonard: Right."
"5","Jimmy: Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?"
"5","Raj: That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie."
"5","Howard: How exactly would these glasses work?"
"5","Jimmy: How the hell should I know? That’s why I need a nerd."
"5","Leonard: I don’t think something like that’s even possible."
"5","Jimmy: Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You’re like the smartest guy I’ve ever known."
"5","Sheldon: The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, I got this."
"5","Sheldon: You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess."
"5","Jimmy: I don’t understand."
"5","Leonard: I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit."
"5","Sheldon: A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples."
"5","Raj: That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples."
"5","Jimmy: What is that?"
"5","Sheldon: This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens."
"5","Leonard: 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
"5","Jimmy: What’s this word?"
"5","Leonard: Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years."
"5","Sheldon: You really need to work on your penmanship."
"5","Jimmy: Oh, man, I, I don’t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun."
"5","Leonard: It wasn’t fun for me."
"5","Sheldon: You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him."
"5","Leonard: Come on, guys."
"5","Raj: That was pretty badass, dude."
"5","Sheldon: I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman."
"5","Leonard: Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it."
"5","Scene: Penny’s bedroom. Penny is on the phone."
"5","Penny: Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school."
"5","Bernadette: You’re doing great."
"5","Penny: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies."
"5","Amy: I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt."
"5","Bernadette: Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now."
"5","Penny: That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch."
"5","Amy: Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?"
"5","Penny: Both."
"5","Bernadette: You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone."
"5","Penny: I actually knew that."
"5","Amy: I never doubted you."
"5","Bernadette: Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown."
"5","Penny: Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?"
"5","Amy: There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor."
"5","Penny: Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?"
"5","Amy: How about donating some of your clothes?"
"5","Penny: Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that."
"5","Bernadette: What about helping people?"
"5","Penny: And helping people."
"5","Leonard: Here’s your cocoa."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
"5","Leonard: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: Heated to precisely 183 degrees?"
"5","Sheldon: Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
"5","Leonard: You got one for good luck. (Knock on door) I’ll get it."
"5","Sheldon: One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton."
"5","Jimmy: Hey."
"5","Leonard: What are you doing here?"
"5","Jimmy: I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What’s this word?"
"5","Leonard: Laxative."
"5","Jimmy: Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry."
"5","Leonard: Really?"
"5","Jimmy: Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me."
"5","Leonard: Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess."
"5","Jimmy: You’re a beautiful guy."
"5","Leonard: Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy."
"5","Jimmy: Okay, I got to go."
"5","Leonard: Are you okay to drive?"
"5","Jimmy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention."
"5","Leonard: No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee."
"5","Jimmy: I wouldn’t be imposing?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, we can’t let him drive."
"5","Sheldon: Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks."
"5","Leonard: You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard."
"5","Jimmy: Not really, no. It’s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we’re reversed. You’re the winner."
"5","Sheldon: You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa."
"5","Jimmy: You mind if I use your bathroom?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah, just back there."
"5","Howard: How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes."
"5","Leonard: Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people."
"5","Sheldon: You know what would be nice?"
"5","Raj: What’s that?"
"5","Sheldon: As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it."
"5","Scene: The clothing bank."
"5","Penny: Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago."
"5","Bernadette: I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first."
"5","Penny: Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away."
"5","Bernadette: Donated."
"5","Penny: Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut."
"5","Bernadette: Penny."
"5","Penny: Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!"
"5","Amy: I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Yeah."
"5","Sheldon: In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
"5","Leonard: What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off."
"5","Sheldon: You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out."
"5","Jimmy (belching): When did I have tacos?"
"5","Leonard: Morning, Jimmy."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, there it is, tacos."
"5","Jimmy: Man, I tied one on."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology."
"5","Jimmy: What apology?"
"5","Leonard: For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school."
"5","Jimmy: Geez, you’re still harping on that? What a puss."
"5","Leonard: That’s my French toast."
"5","Jimmy: It’s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy."
"5","Sheldon: I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him."
"5","Leonard: I might kill him right now."
"5","Sheldon: The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared, but he has your back."
"5","Leonard: Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go."
"5","Jimmy: Yeah, all right, let me just finish this."
"5","Leonard: No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now."
"5","Sheldon: Well said, Boy Wonder."
"5","Jimmy: Or what?"
"5","Sheldon: Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience."
"5","Leonard: I’m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! (Pushes him) Uh-oh."
"5","Scene: Running down the stairwell."
"5","Sheldon: You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?"
"5","Sheldon: I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you."
"5","Scene: The clothes bank."
"5","Bernadette: I don’t feel good about this."
"5","Penny: Then sit in the car and keep it running."
"5","Amy: You were right, a whole new load."
"5","Penny: Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top."
"5","Amy: Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size."
"5","Bernadette: God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?"
"5","Penny: Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on."
"5","Amy: What is it, the fuzz?"
"5","Penny: Look at us. What are we doing?"
"5","Amy: I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don’t know about Bernadette."
"5","Penny: You know, this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here."
"5","Bernadette (taking boots and running): It’s okay, I serve soup to poor people!"
"5","Series 05 Episode 12 – The Shiny Trinket Maneouvre"
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Howard: Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?"
"5","Leonard: Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood."
"5","Howard: Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you’d like to examine it?"
"5","Raj: Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party."
"5","Howard: As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. (Pulls out a goldfish in a jar)"
"5","Raj: I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it."
"5","Sheldon: This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?"
"5","Howard: How is this lying?"
"5","Sheldon: A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister."
"5","Raj: Can’t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?"
"5","Sheldon: If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie."
"5","Howard: Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!"
"5","Sheldon: Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose."
"5","Howard: How is that not amusing?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. (Storms out)"
"5","Howard: Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da."
"5","Leonard: Next time, you should open with that."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory."
"5","Penny: Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy."
"5","Sheldon: And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?"
"5","Penny: So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?"
"5","Amy: Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night."
"5","Penny: That is so hot."
"5","Sheldon: All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?"
"5","Amy: How was your day?"
"5","Sheldon: Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin."
"5","Amy: Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron."
"5","Sheldon: Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers."
"5","Amy: That’s nice. Anyway, I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, I’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field."
"5","Sheldon: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here."
"5","Penny: So, are we ready to order?"
"5","Amy: Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up."
"5","Sheldon: Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination."
"5","Penny: Sheldon, what is wrong with you?"
"5","Sheldon: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside."
"5","Penny: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things."
"5","Penny: Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by."
"5","Sheldon: What if they simply don’t excite me?"
"5","Penny: Well, just smile and think about koalas."
"5","Sheldon: She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this."
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff."
"5","Howard: Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act."
"5","Bernadette: Did it work?"
"5","Howard: Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act."
"5","Bernadette: Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?"
"5","Howard: Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Has she tried on the vest yet?"
"5","Howard: I just gave it to her!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She’s short and stacked, like me!"
"5","Howard: She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!"
"5","Bernadette: Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant."
"5","Howard: You’ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it."
"5","Bernadette: You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids."
"5","Howard: Well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?"
"5","Bernadette: Mmm, yeah, sure."
"5","Howard: Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there."
"5","Leonard: Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes."
"5","Leonard: How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around."
"5","Sheldon: Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head."
"5","Leonard: Some people go outside and do that."
"5","Sheldon: It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."
"5","Leonard: You want to talk about it?"
"5","Sheldon: No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away."
"5","Leonard: You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?"
"5","Sheldon: Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material."
"5","Leonard: Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?"
"5","Sheldon: Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?"
"5","Leonard: No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women."
"5","Sheldon: I’ll say."
"5","Leonard: That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you."
"5","Sheldon: I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on."
"5","Leonard: Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change."
"5","Sheldon: Nuts to that. What else you got?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something."
"5","Sheldon: How does that work?"
"5","Leonard: Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture."
"5","Sheldon: Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it."
"5","Leonard: Glad I could help."
"5","Sheldon: It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour."
"5","Scene: The birthday party."
"5","Howard: And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, ah, right. (Bangs drum and cymbal) And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous illusion."
"5","Child: When are we gonna have cake?"
"5","Bernadette: After you’ve been thoroughly amazed."
"5","Child: But we want cake now."
"5","Bernadette: Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?"
"5","Howard: Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk."
"5","Second child: I know how you do that trick."
"5","Bernadette: Do you know how to pipe down?"
"5","Howard: Okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper."
"5","Second child: It’s a fake pitcher."
"5","Bernadette: You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini."
"5","Howard: Okay, we’re going to stick this in here (puts newspaper into trouser waistband) and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants."
"5","Second child: Look, I Googled it. It’s a fake pitcher."
"5","Bernadette: That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?"
"5","Howard: She’s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake."
"5","Bernadette: Not him."
"5","Howard: Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher."
"5","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"5","Bernadette: I told you I’m not good with kids."
"5","Howard: Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle."
"5","Bernadette: The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters."
"5","Howard: Yeah, so?"
"5","Bernadette: Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!"
"5","Howard: All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we’re fine."
"5","Bernadette: I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children."
"5","Howard: Yeah, no, we all got that. But don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?"
"5","Bernadette: Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different."
"5","Howard: Well, yeah."
"5","Scene: A jewellery store."
"5","Sheldon: I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears."
"5","Penny: Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff."
"5","Sheldon: Ooh, a pocket watch."
"5","Penny: Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch."
"5","Sheldon: No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
"5","Penny: Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?"
"5","Assistant: Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?"
"5","Penny: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple."
"5","Sheldon: Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me."
"5","Penny: Fine, go ahead."
"5","Sheldon: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple."
"5","Assistant: My apologies. How can I help you today?"
"5","Penny: He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present."
"5","Assistant: Great, trouble with girlfriends is what’s putting my daughter through USC."
"5","Penny: Ooh, are these real diamonds?"
"5","Assistant: Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight."
"5","Sheldon: Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars."
"5","Assistant: Actually, that’s only 750. Everything’s on sale."
"5","Sheldon: Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch."
"5","Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Donkey Kong Jenga."
"5","Howard: I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I’d be a dad someday."
"5","Raj: Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."
"5","Leonard: There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved."
"5","Raj: Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?"
"5","Howard: Yeah, she doesn’t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual."
"5","Leonard: What are you gonna do?"
"5","Howard: I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers."
"5","Leonard: You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them."
"5","Raj: Wow, that’s rough. Where’d you get that?"
"5","Leonard: It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book."
"5","Howard: Maybe me and Bernadette aren’t right for each other."
"5","Leonard: Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back."
"5","Howard: I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
"5","Raj: What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?"
"5","Howard: Huh, it’ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I’m golden."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Sheldon: What time did you tell Amy to be here?"
"5","Penny: Eight o’clock. (Sheldon checks pocket watch) Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous."
"5","Sheldon: Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?"
"5","Penny: I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?"
"5","Sheldon: Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious."
"5","Amy: Hey."
"5","Penny: Hi."
"5","Amy: What’s he doing here?"
"5","Penny: Okay, he wants to talk to you."
"5","Amy: Well, I don’t want to talk to him. And I’m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won’t last."
"5","Penny: Sheldon, you’re up."
"5","Sheldon: Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you."
"5","Amy: We both know that’s your koala face."
"5","Sheldon: I told you."
"5","Penny: Okay, look, he bought you this."
"5","Amy: Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me."
"5","Penny: You look beautiful."
"5","Amy: Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!"
"5","Sheldon: You’re right, the tiara was too much."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard! Bernadette’s… Oh, she slipped right by me."
"5","Bernadette: Here’s your vest back."
"5","Howard: You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime."
"5","Bernadette: Where?"
"5","Howard: I don’t know, hunting?"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Don’t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don’t get grandkids!"
"5","Howard: Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!"
"5","Bernadette: I guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
"5","Howard: I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes."
"5","Bernadette: Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution."
"5","Howard: Really? That’s great. What?"
"5","Bernadette: Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?"
"5","Howard: Me?"
"5","Bernadette: Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life."
"5","Howard: Yeah."
"5","Bernadette: Yay, so we’re good."
"5","Howard: Yeah, we’re good."
"5","Bernadette: You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?"
"5","Howard: I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it’s a condom."
"5","Series 05 Episode 13 – The Recombination Hypothesis"
"5","Scene: The stairwell."
"5","Leonard: You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?"
"5","Sheldon: You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?"
"5","Leonard: Okay, let’s talk about that."
"5","Sheldon: As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind."
"5","Leonard: We all do. Now, how about dinner?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded."
"5","Leonard (seeing Penny’s door open and the girls inside): Excuse me."
"5","Sheldon: Permission granted, Commander."
"5","Amy: Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling."
"5","Leonard: Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?"
"5","Penny: Why, you guys going somewhere?"
"5","Leonard: No, I mean just you and me."
"5","Penny: You mean, like a date?"
"5","Leonard: Not like a date, a date."
"5","Amy: Ooh!"
"5","Bernadette: Ooh!"
"5","Penny: Um, o-okay. Sure."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"5","Bernadette: This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them."
"5","Amy: How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?"
"5","Bernadette: Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?"
"5","Penny: Just a sec. (Emerges in revealing slinky green dress) Too much?"
"5","Bernadette: Yes."
"5","Amy: No."
"5","Penny: Okay, just hang on."
"5","Amy: You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?"
"5","Bernadette: When did you and Leonard break up?"
"5","Penny: Uh, about two years ago."
"5","Bernadette: Why do you think he asked you out again?"
"5","Penny: I don’t know."
"5","Amy: Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic."
"5","Penny: He’s not dying."
"5","Amy: Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines."
"5","Penny: How about this?"
"5","Bernadette: Maybe."
"5","Amy: Come on."
"5","Penny: Yeah, okay, no."
"5","Bernadette: Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?"
"5","Penny: Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes."
"5","Amy: If he were dying, would you sleep with him?"
"5","Penny: What?"
"5","Amy: Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head."
"5","Penny: Okay, he is not dying."
"5","Amy: How do you know? Are you a doctor?"
"5","Bernadette: You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network."
"5","Penny: Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner."
"5","Amy: With a dead man."
"5","Penny: Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous."
"5","Bernadette: Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great."
"5","Penny: I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?"
"5","Amy: Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette."
"5","Bernadette: Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this."
"5","Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing a board game."
"5","Sheldon: Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? (Raj and Howard snigger) I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?"
"5","Leonard: Okay, how do I look?"
"5","Howard: Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?"
"5","Leonard: What are you talking about?"
"5","Raj: Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down."
"5","Leonard: I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship."
"5","Raj: I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement."
"5","Sheldon: You want to know my opinion?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, boy, do I?"
"5","Sheldon: Sarcasm?"
"5","Howard: No."
"5","Sheldon: All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother."
"5","Leonard: Where on earth did you get that from?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby."
"5","Leonard: That doesn’t make it true."
"5","Sheldon: It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: See you later."
"5","Raj: If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock."
"5","Howard: Why?"
"5","Raj: Because she’s great in everything."
"5","Sheldon: Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?"
"5","Scene: A restaurant."
"5","Leonard: So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"
"5","Penny: Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah, that sounds right."
"5","Penny: Yeah?"
"5","Leonard: Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes."
"5","Penny: Okay."
"5","Leonard: So, Polly, tell me about yourself."
"5","Penny: It’s Penny."
"5","Leonard: Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward."
"5","Penny: Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn."
"5","Leonard: Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles."
"5","Penny: Wow. Can they?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal."
"5","Penny: Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?"
"5","Leonard: Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds."
"5","Penny: What does that mean?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer."
"5","Penny: You are so funny."
"5","Leonard: Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off."
"5","Penny: Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this."
"5","Leonard: Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?"
"5","Penny: Whoa. Not so fast."
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry, what did I say?"
"5","Penny: Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you."
"5","Leonard: Oh, God."
"5","Leonard: You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me."
"5","Penny: So?"
"5","Leonard: So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you."
"5","Penny: How would you say it?"
"5","Leonard: I have feelings for you."
"5","Penny: It’s the same thing."
"5","Leonard: No, it’s not. Always made it worse."
"5","Penny: You’re overthinking this."
"5","Leonard: No, I’m not."
"5","Penny: Yes, you are. You always overthink things."
"5","Leonard: Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse."
"5","Penny: See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk."
"5","Leonard: Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking."
"5","Penny: Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for."
"5","Leonard: Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Sheldon: And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement."
"5","Raj: He’s got to be doing this on purpose."
"5","Howard (as Leonard enters): Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?"
"5","Leonard: You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother."
"5","Raj: I guess it didn’t go well."
"5","Sheldon: We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home."
"5","Howard (as Leonard groans loudly in his room): How about now?"
"5","Sheldon: Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game."
"5","Raj: You were in the middle of an erection."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand."
"5","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Leonard’s phone text signal sounds."
"5","Leonard: What does she want from me now? (Goes to front door, where Penny is waiting) What’s up?"
"5","Penny: Do not overthink this. (Kisses him, then leads him to her apartment.)"
"5","Leonard: I don’t understand."
"5","Penny: Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup."
"5","Leonard: Okay, but earlier it seemed like…"
"5","Penny: No talking."
"5","Leonard: Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions."
"5","Scene: Penny’s bedroom. They are in bed."
"5","Penny: Well, that was fun."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp."
"5","Penny: You hung in there, though."
"5","Leonard: Well, there was a lot at stake."
"5","Penny: So what do you want to do now?"
"5","Leonard: Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?"
"5","Penny: I don’t know, it’s complicated."
"5","Leonard: Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
"5","Penny: Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked."
"5","Leonard: Why? What are you afraid of?"
"5","Penny: Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?"
"5","Leonard: What if I dump you?"
"5","Penny: Come on, be serious."
"5","Leonard: Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public."
"5","Penny: So we don’t tell people we’re back together?"
"5","Leonard: Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly."
"5","Penny: Well, we don’t really have to pretend."
"5","Leonard: And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool."
"5","Penny: Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers."
"5","Leonard: I can’t believe you kept this."
"5","Penny: Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t."
"5","Leonard: That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Leonard is sneaking back in."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?"
"5","Sheldon: Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?"
"5","Leonard: Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
"5","Sheldon: I was using the bathroom."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, well, so was I."
"5","Sheldon: Really? I didn’t see you in there."
"5","Leonard: Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one."
"5","Sheldon: Where?"
"5","Leonard: The, the gas station across the street."
"5","Sheldon: In your pyjamas?"
"5","Leonard: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: Without shoes?"
"5","Sheldon: On a cold winter’s night?"
"5","Sheldon: Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did."
"5","Sheldon: Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister."
"5","Leonard: What?"
"5","Sheldon: After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?"
"5","Leonard: No."
"5","Sheldon: Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky."
"5","Leonard: I don’t want beef jerky."
"5","Sheldon: It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron."
"5","Leonard: Fine."
"5","Sheldon: Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed."
"5","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space."
"5","Sheldon: We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so."
"5","Bernadette: I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny."
"5","Amy: Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship."
"5","Sheldon: You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler."
"5","Leonard: We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker."
"5","Sheldon: Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine."
"5","Howard: I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny."
"5","Leonard: Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends."
"5","Bernadette: Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up."
"5","Howard: Why not?"
"5","Bernadette: I’m a very vengeful person."
"5","Howard: Really?"
"5","Bernadette: With access to weaponised smallpox."
"5","Penny: Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?"
"5","Howard: Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you."
"5","Bernadette: Howard."
"5","Penny: No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, that’s nice."
"5","Leonard: See, she knew what always meant."
"5","Penny: Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?"
"5","Leonard: I’m just making a point."
"5","Penny: Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?"
"5","Sheldon: People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order."
"5","Penny: Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right."
"5","Leonard: Oh, that is not true."
"5","Sheldon: I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know."
"5","Penny: You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else."
"5","Leonard: Well…"
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry."
"5","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Text signal."
"5","Leonard: Unbelievable. (Goes to door)"
"5","Penny: Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?"
"5","Leonard: Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?"
"5","Penny: No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag."
"5","Leonard: You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap. (Goes to Penny’s apartment.)"
"5","Penny: The hell do you think you’re going?"
"5","Leonard: Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, kind of, yeah."
"5","Leonard: What are we doing?"
"5","Penny: What do you mean?"
"5","Leonard: Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly."
"5","Penny: That’s because you overthink everything."
"5","Sheldon’s voice: Leonard, are you listening to me? (Leonard is in the hallway with Sheldon. It is the opening scene, and Sheldon has just found his cardboard Spock.)"
"5","Leonard: What? Yeah."
"5","Sheldon: This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes."
"5","Sheldon: You’re right, I’ll give him a shot."
"5","Leonard: Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?"
"5","Penny: Uh, have you thought this through?"
"5","Leonard: Yes, and I think we should go anyway."
"5","Sheldon: No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back."
"5","Amy: If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with."
"5","Bernadette: What about me and Howard?"
"5","Amy: Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure."
"5","Bernadette: Where are you guys going to eat?"
"5","Amy: Penny?"
"5","(In her imagination, Penny is transported to her wedding day.)"
"5","Minister: Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?"
"5","Penny (turning, heavily pregnant): Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?"
"5","(Back in the bedroom)"
"5","Penny: Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore."
"5","Series 05 Episode 14 – The Beta Test Initiation"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is making a video."
"5","Sheldon: Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
"5","Amy: Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?"
"5","Sheldon: Vexillology is the study of flags."
"5","Amy: Cool. I think I just learned something."
"5","Sheldon: Did you have fun doing it?"
"5","Amy: I’ll say."
"5","Sheldon: Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more."
"5","Amy: Sweet!"
"5","Sheldon: Why are you waving a white flag?"
"5","Amy: I’m surrendering to fun."
"5","Sheldon: Now, today’s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold ’em, you gotta know how to fold ’em. Let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…"
"5","Leonard: Excuse me, sorry, excuse me."
"5","Sheldon: Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?"
"5","Leonard: Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here."
"5","Sheldon: And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!"
"5","Amy: You okay?"
"5","Sheldon: No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
"5","Amy: Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?"
"5","Sheldon: Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?"
"5","Amy: It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers."
"5","Sheldon: Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The stairwell."
"5","Penny: That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again."
"5","Leonard: Me, too, I missed you."
"5","Penny: You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?"
"5","Leonard: Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?"
"5","Penny: I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow."
"5","Leonard: Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off."
"5","Penny: Okay, well, maybe not that slow."
"5","Leonard: How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?"
"5","Penny: You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not."
"5","Leonard: Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed."
"5","Penny: You mean like a beta test?"
"5","Leonard: Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…"
"5","Penny: Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?"
"5","Leonard: No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good."
"5","Penny: All right. Let’s give it a shot."
"5","Leonard: Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange."
"5","Penny: Okay. Good night, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back."
"5","Sheldon: Cut! Take 47."
"5","Scene: Sheldon and Raj’s office."
"5","Sheldon: Here’s an interesting fact about flags."
"5","Raj: I will take that action."
"5","Sheldon: The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism."
"5","Howard: Let’s see the new phone."
"5","Raj: I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?"
"5","Howard: Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part."
"5","Raj: Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment."
"5","Howard: Oh, yeah."
"5","Sheldon: Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself."
"5","Howard: Oh, let me try the voice recognition."
"5","Raj: Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy. (To phone) Hello?"
"5","Phone: Hello."
"5","Raj: What’s your name?"
"5","Phone: My name is Siri."
"5","Howard: Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to."
"5","Raj: Are you single?"
"5","Siri: I don’t have a marital status, if that’s what you’re asking."
"5","Raj: Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?"
"5","Siri: I’ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you."
"5","Raj: I will see you gentlemen later."
"5","Howard: She is gonna break his heart."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Amy: For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London."
"5","Sheldon: Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con."
"5","Penny: Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?"
"5","Leonard: Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no."
"5","Penny: Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV."
"5","Leonard: Even Doctor Who?"
"5","Penny: Even Doctor Who."
"5","Sheldon: All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out."
"5","Leonard: Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity."
"5","Penny: Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow."
"5","Leonard: Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here."
"5","Penny: What’s this?"
"5","Leonard: My bug report to you."
"5","Penny: Well, that’s quite a list you got there."
"5","Leonard: It’s colour coded."
"5","Penny: Oh."
"5","Leonard: Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?"
"5","Penny: Yep."
"5","Leonard: So, have a good night."
"5","Leonard: Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard."
"5","Amy: What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?"
"5","Sheldon: How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?"
"5","Amy: Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth."
"5","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"5","Raj: So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?"
"5","Siri: I am well."
"5","Raj: What are you doing right now?"
"5","Siri: What am I doing? I’m talking with you."
"5","Raj: You have a beautiful voice."
"5","Siri: Thank you, it’s nice to be appreciated."
"5","Raj: I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?"
"5","Siri: Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don’t women like me?”"
"5","Raj: No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?"
"5","Siri: My name is Siri."
"5","Raj: Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj."
"5","Siri: Would you like me to call you Raj?"
"5","Raj: I’d like you to call me sexy."
"5","Siri: From now on, I’ll call you sexy. Okay?"
"5","Raj: Okay."
"5","Siri, I’m in the mood for gelato."
"5","Siri: (chimes) I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you."
"5","Raj: Thank you, darling."
"5","Siri: You are most certainly welcome, sexy."
"5","Sheldon: Well done, Dr. Koothrappali."
"5","Raj: I’m sorry?"
"5","Sheldon: You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos."
"5","Raj: I haven’t bonded with it."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me."
"5","Raj: It’s just a phone."
"5","Barry Kripke: Cooper."
"5","Sheldon: Kripke."
"5","Barry: Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we’re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o’cwock, pot wuck."
"5","Raj: Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers."
"5","Siri: All right, I’ll remind you."
"5","Barry (to his own phone): You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?"
"5","Barry’s Siri: I’m sorry, Bawwy. I don’t understand wecommend a westauwant."
"5","Barry: Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant."
"5","Barry’s Siri: I don’t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant."
"5","Barry: See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi."
"5","Raj: Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady."
"5","Barry: Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment door. Leonard knocks."
"5","Penny: It’s open."
"5","Leonard: Hey. You ready to go?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter."
"5","Leonard: Can you finish it later?"
"5","Penny: No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more."
"5","Leonard: Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?"
"5","Penny: Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs."
"5","Leonard: They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise."
"5","Penny: All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy."
"5","Leonard: Thank you."
"5","Penny: Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there."
"5","Leonard: All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here."
"5","Raj: Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready."
"5","Howard: Great."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, smells amazing in here."
"5","Howard: Yeah, what are we eating?"
"5","Raj: Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious."
"5","Bernadette: Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?"
"5","Howard: Yes. His phone."
"5","Bernadette: Oh. Is that cute or creepy?"
"5","Howard: Uh-huh."
"5","Raj: Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz."
"5","Siri: Playing smooth jazz."
"5","Raj: Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria."
"5","Bernadette: I don’t know if I want to stay."
"5","Scene: A shooting range."
"5","Penny: This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?"
"5","Leonard: I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it."
"5","Penny: Okay, you’re kind of really great."
"5","Leonard: You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?"
"5","Penny: Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up."
"5","Leonard: Right. Sorry, sorry."
"5","Penny: And stop apologizing all the time."
"5","Leonard: Right. Sorry."
"5","Penny: All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?"
"5","Leonard: I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat."
"5","Penny: Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. (Kisses him. Leonard accidentally shoots himself in the foot.)"
"5","Leonard: So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass."
"5","Penny: No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe."
"5","Leonard: Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law."
"5","Penny: Well, thank you for a really cool evening."
"5","Leonard: Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?"
"5","Penny: Things are looking good."
"5","Leonard: So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have."
"5","Penny: Good night, you."
"5","Sheldon: Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian."
"5","Amy: Und ich bin eine pretzel!"
"5","Sheldon: Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…"
"5","Amy: Mit…"
"5","Sheldon: Flags."
"5","Scene: An office suite."
"5","Receptionist: First door on the left."
"5","Raj: Thank you. (Enters a door marked “The Office of Siri” Inside is a red-headed woman sitting at a huge console desk.)"
"5","Siri: Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. (To Raj) Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you’d like to make love to me, just tell me. (Raj tries to speak) I’m sorry. I don’t understand."
"5","Raj (waking from a dream): No!"
"5","Series 05 Episode 15 – The Friendship Contraction"
"5","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon enters in a hard hat and high-vis jacket. Sounds a klaxon on his phone."
"5","Leonard: Aaargh. What the hell?"
"5","Sheldon: Emergency preparedness drill."
"5","Leonard: Oh, no, come on!"
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead."
"5","Leonard: I have to get a lock for my door."
"5","Sheldon: I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?"
"5","Leonard: Fine."
"5","Sheldon: All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest."
"5","Leonard: Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People."
"5","Sheldon: You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know, what am I doing?"
"5","Sheldon: Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice. (Grabs him and pushes him over) Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!"
"5","Leonard: Aah!"
"5","Sheldon: And that’s why we wear hard hats."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The cafeteria."
"5","Howard: Check it out, press release from NASA."
"5","Raj: Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz."
"5","Howard: This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter."
"5","Raj: Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname."
"5","Howard: I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me."
"5","Raj: Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite."
"5","Howard: Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname."
"5","Raj: Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?"
"5","Leonard: Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine."
"5","Howard: Emergency drill night last night, huh?"
"5","Leonard: Uh-huh."
"5","Raj: How’d you do?"
"5","Sheldon: I’ll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness: unsatisfactory. Follows direction: barely. Attitude: a little too much. Overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else’s day."
"5","Leonard: You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?"
"5","Sheldon: You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock."
"5","Leonard: Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?"
"5","Sheldon: Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico."
"5","Raj: They put you under for a cleaning?"
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter."
"5","Leonard: Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist."
"5","Sheldon: Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”"
"5","Leonard: You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches."
"5","Sheldon: Well, it has. Ask anybody."
"5","Leonard: I don’t care. I’m done."
"5","Sheldon: Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes."
"5","Sheldon: Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. (Demonstrating) ‘Sup?"
"5","Leonard: Where do I sign?"
"5","Sheldon: Right here. Use your finger."
"5","Leonard: There. Done."
"5","Sheldon: All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me."
"5","Leonard: I’m gonna go home and take a nap."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Howard: I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills."
"5","Penny: What does that mean?"
"5","Bernadette: He’s gonna learn to poop in space."
"5","Howard: Open the pod bay doors, HAL."
"5","Raj: Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite."
"5","Sheldon: Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter."
"5","Leonard: ‘Sup?"
"5","Sheldon: ‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it."
"5","Amy: I saved you a dumpling."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow."
"5","Amy: I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s."
"5","Sheldon: You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?"
"5","Penny: Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?"
"5","Bernadette: Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?"
"5","Howard: Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid."
"5","Sheldon: Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?"
"5","Raj: Their meatballs are pretty good."
"5","Sheldon: What’s that?"
"5","Raj: Nothing, nothing."
"5","Scene: The comic book store."
"5","Sheldon: Hello, Stuart."
"5","Stuart: Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?"
"5","Sheldon: No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person."
"5","Stuart: Ninth?"
"5","Sheldon: You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?"
"5","Stuart: Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note."
"5","Sheldon: Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?"
"5","Stuart: Yeah."
"5","Sheldon: And your father? Alive?"
"5","Stuart: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: How about your grandparents, they alive?"
"5","Stuart: No."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?"
"5","Stuart: I’m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot."
"5","Stuart: Sheldon, I’m working. I can’t take you to the dentist. Also, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t want to take you to the dentist."
"5","Sheldon: Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from."
"5","Raj: Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?"
"5","Howard: You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken."
"5","Raj: Buzz Lightyear is not real."
"5","Howard: No, that’s not what I’m talking about."
"5","Raj: Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?"
"5","Howard: No."
"5","Raj: Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz."
"5","Howard: Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash."
"5","Raj: All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?"
"5","Leonard: That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz."
"5","Howard: Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts."
"5","Raj: Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it."
"5","Howard: Like how?"
"5","Leonard: Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan."
"5","Howard: Did it work?"
"5","Leonard: No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth."
"5","Raj: Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed."
"5","Howard: That’s actually not a terrible plan."
"5","Raj: They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing."
"5","Leonard (to Sheldon, entering): ‘Sup?"
"5","Sheldon: ‘Sup?"
"5","Leonard: Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?"
"5","Sheldon: Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind."
"5","Leonard: All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist."
"5","Sheldon: Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?"
"5","Leonard: Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own."
"5","Raj: Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes."
"5","Sheldon: I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Leonard is watching television. All the power goes off."
"5","Penny (entering): Oh, good, your power’s out, too."
"5","Leonard: Why is that good?"
"5","Penny: Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra."
"5","Sheldon: Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol."
"5","Leonard: What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you."
"5","Leonard: It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon."
"5","Sheldon: And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first."
"5","Penny: You know, I got some candles in my apartment."
"5","Sheldon: But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick."
"5","Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre): You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go."
"5","Sheldon: Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement."
"5","Penny: I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Leonard: To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water."
"5","Penny: You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?"
"5","Leonard: I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow."
"5","Penny: Okay. Do you want to make out slow?"
"5","Leonard: I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth."
"5","Penny: Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now."
"5","Sheldon: Excuse me, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you."
"5","Sheldon: Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day."
"5","Leonard: Fine, what is it?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire."
"5","Leonard: S’mores, huh? Good for you."
"5","Sheldon: Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement."
"5","Leonard: No, thanks. I’m good."
"5","Sheldon: Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself."
"5","Penny: Aw."
"5","Leonard: No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself."
"5","Penny: But he’s sad."
"5","Leonard: No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in."
"5","Penny: I think he misses his little buddy."
"5","Leonard: Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over."
"5","Leonard: I thought you said candles were dangerous."
"5","Sheldon: This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what I’m doing. Oh, drat. (His s’more is on fire. He dunks it in a glass of water.) Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water."
"5","Leonard: Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement."
"5","Sheldon: What are you proposing?"
"5","Leonard: That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation."
"5","Sheldon: And how would I do that?"
"5","Leonard: You say thank you."
"5","Sheldon: Every time?"
"5","Leonard: It’s not crazy."
"5","Sheldon: Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day."
"5","Leonard: I kind of like the sound of that."
"5","Sheldon: Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else. (Lights come back on) Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water."
"5","Leonard: So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?"
"5","Sheldon: No."
"5","Leonard: Can I sit in your spot?"
"5","Leonard: Can I control the thermostat?"
"5","Leonard: Do I get a card?"
"5","Sheldon: Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day."
"5","Penny: Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch."
"5","Leonard: Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard’s Day."
"5","Penny: Leonard’s Day?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re good."
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"5","Howard: All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song."
"5","Raj: Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?"
"5","Howard: Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don’t bother me!"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut."
"5","Howard: Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning."
"5","NASA Guy (on skype): Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early."
"5","Howard: No problem, Dr. Massimino."
"5","Dr Massimino: The guys here call me Mass."
"5","Howard: Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration."
"5","Mass: Yeah. It’s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the…"
"5","Howard: Sorry. My phone."
"5","Mass: What is that? Is that Rocket Man?"
"5","Howard: Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!"
"5","Howard: Not now!"
"5","Mass: Who’s that?"
"5","Howard: My mom. Sorry."
"5","Howard: No problem, Fruit Loops."
"5","Series 05 Episode 16 – The Vacation Solution"
"5","Scene: The cafeteria."
"5","Sheldon: Gentlemen, I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number."
"5","Leonard: Five."
"5","Sheldon: Uh-huh. And an irrational constant."
"5","Howard: E."
"5","Sheldon: And a funny Greek letter."
"5","Raj: Gamma."
"5","Sheldon: I said funny."
"5","Raj: Upsilon?"
"5","Sheldon: Good one. And an electrical charge."
"5","Leonard: Positive."
"5","Sheldon: Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a (laughs uncontrollably). Okay. No, no. I’ll start over. Professor (laughs again)"
"5","Howard: I haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t."
"5","Leonard: It’s not funny. That mistake got published."
"5","Sheldon: Stop! I’m going to wet myself!"
"5","Raj: Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way."
"5","Howard: I wonder what he wants."
"5","Leonard: Doesn’t look happy, so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon."
"5","Seibert: Dr. Cooper?"
"5","Leonard: Told ya."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, President Siebert, I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office."
"5","Seibert: No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere."
"5","Sheldon: You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions."
"5","Seibert: Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you’re refusing to take your vacation."
"5","Sheldon: I don’t need a vacation."
"5","Seibert: You’re obligated to take one. And I’d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I’ll see you all on Monday, except for you."
"5","Sheldon: But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
"5","Seibert: Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year."
"5","Sheldon: Sarcasm?"
"5","Howard: No. You should go."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: Leonard’s car. Leonard is singing enthusiastically."
"5","Leonard: That tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, I got my money, let’s spend it up…"
"5","Sheldon (appearing in the back seat): Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!"
"5","Leonard: What the hell are you doing?"
"5","Sheldon: Bleeding from my ears."
"5","Leonard: What are you doing hiding back there?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps."
"5","Leonard: Lobster traps?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse."
"5","Leonard: What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you."
"5","Sheldon: Will they, Leonard? (Puts on cap and long-hair wig)"
"5","Leonard: Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I’ll drive you there."
"5","Sheldon: And no more singing."
"5","Leonard: Fine."
"5","Sheldon: I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Penny: I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon."
"5","Bernadette: Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew."
"5","Amy: This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day."
"5","Bernadette: You mean my special day?"
"5","Amy: They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head."
"5","Bernadette: If I ever actually ever get married."
"5","Penny: Why wouldn’t you?"
"5","Bernadette: My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup."
"5","Penny: Ouch."
"5","Bernadette: Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out."
"5","Amy: Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it."
"5","Bernadette: I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him."
"5","Penny: You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing."
"5","Bernadette: I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with sex."
"5","Penny: Oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for."
"5","Amy: You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. (To Penny) You would fetch a unicorn."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?"
"5","Sheldon: Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii."
"5","Howard: How about Florida? They’ve got Cape Canaveral, they’ve got Disney, they’ve got my Aunt Ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride."
"5","Sheldon: My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message."
"5","Raj: You know, if I had a week off, I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones."
"5","Howard: I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage."
"5","Raj: Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life."
"5","Howard: I don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, everybody takes vacations."
"5","Sheldon: One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project."
"5","Howard: Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was."
"5","Sheldon: Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab."
"5","Howard: Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?"
"5","Sheldon: Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert."
"5","Scene: The hallway."
"5","Leonard: Hey."
"5","Penny: Hey, you."
"5","Leonard: Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there."
"5","Penny: Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?"
"5","Leonard: It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway."
"5","Penny: What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup."
"5","Leonard: Wow. That’s rough."
"5","Penny: So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?"
"5","Leonard: Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?"
"5","Penny: I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes."
"5","Leonard: Joke all you want, but you think about it."
"5","Penny: Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations."
"5","Leonard: Good luck catching a man with that attitude."
"5","Scene: Amy’s laboratory."
"5","Sheldon: Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away."
"5","Amy: I’m excited to work with my boyfriend. It’s gonna be romantic."
"5","Sheldon: Way to kill the mood."
"5","Amy: Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell."
"5","Sheldon: Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha, I’m a freak!"
"5","Amy: Oh, I’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
"5","Sheldon: Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?"
"5","Amy: No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny."
"5","Sheldon: What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology."
"5","Sheldon: I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this."
"5","Leonard: Where’s Howard?"
"5","Raj: No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?"
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?"
"5","Raj: Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler."
"5","Leonard: Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup."
"5","Raj: Oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated."
"5","Leonard: I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?"
"5","Raj: Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart."
"5","Howard: Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price."
"5","Leonard: Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something."
"5","Howard: I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care."
"5","Leonard: Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."
"5","Howard: A pre-nup? Wow."
"5","Leonard: What are you gonna do?"
"5","Howard: I don’t know."
"5","Raj: Follow your heart."
"5","Howard: You know what, it’s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It’s completely reasonable."
"5","Leonard; Good. That’s a healthy attitude."
"5","Howard: Yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too."
"5","Raj: Like what?"
"5","Howard: I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company."
"5","Raj: Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy."
"5","Sheldon: Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan."
"5","Amy: Soap spots. Wash ’em again."
"5","Sheldon: Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it."
"5","Sheldon: Biologists are mean."
"5","Later."
"5","Amy: All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes."
"5","Sheldon: There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly."
"5","Amy: I’m sure it was."
"5","Sheldon: I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter."
"5","Amy: Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting."
"5","Sheldon: You know what this place needs? A suggestion box."
"5","Sheldon: 366… 367…"
"5","Amy: How’s it going?"
"5","Sheldon: How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this."
"5","Amy: Great."
"5","Sheldon: Aw, nuts! One…"
"5","Sheldon: This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up."
"5","Amy: Really? Is that what you think?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true."
"5","Amy: Hey, I’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom."
"5","Sheldon: I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, I’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right."
"5","Sheldon: Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math."
"5","Amy: Maybe the math was too bubbly for him."
"5","Sheldon: You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too."
"5","Amy: Okay, smart guy. I’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it."
"5","Sheldon: All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus."
"5","Amy: You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you."
"5","Sheldon: It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house."
"5","Amy: Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?"
"5","Sheldon: No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?"
"5","Amy: No. But your thumb does."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, dear. (Faints)"
"5","Amy: Yeah, you’re a biologist."
"5","Scene: The bar at the Cheesecake Factory."
"5","Howard: What are you doing here?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid."
"5","Howard: What happened to your thumb?"
"5","Sheldon: You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on."
"5","Barman: What can I get you?"
"5","Sheldon: Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those."
"5","Penny: Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
"5","Howard: We’re grown men, we drink at bars."
"5","Penny: No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?"
"5","Howard: Oh, yeah, sure."
"5","Penny: You and Amy? Good?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, better than good."
"5","Penny: You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens."
"5","Howard: I’m not signing a pre-nup."
"5","Penny: All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood."
"5","Sheldon: Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. (Removes plaster. Faints again)"
"5","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?"
"5","Amy: What do you want?"
"5","Sheldon: I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week."
"5","Amy: Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?"
"5","Sheldon: I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood."
"5","Amy: That’s not an apology."
"5","Sheldon: That is your opinion."
"5","Amy: I want a real apology."
"5","Sheldon: I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…"
"5","Amy: No."
"5","Sheldon: That my genius…"
"5","Sheldon: That the soap was…"
"5","Amy: Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Fine. Sorry."
"5","Amy: You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday."
"5","Sheldon: Next year I’m going to Epcot."
"5","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"5","Bernadette: Are you mad at me?"
"5","Howard: No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine."
"5","Bernadette: So, what are we gonna do?"
"5","Howard: You really want me to sign a pre-nup?"
"5","Bernadette: I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though."
"5","Howard: Why don’t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?"
"5","Bernadette: Really? Oh, that’d be so great."
"5","Howard: Done."
"5","Bernadette: I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement."
"5","Howard: Okay."
"5","Bernadette: And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish."
"5","Howard: Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?"
"5","Bernadette: So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there."
"5","Howard: You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May."
"5","Bernadette: In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station."
"5","Howard: They’ve got a phone."
"5","Series 05 Episode 17 – The Rothman Disintegration"
"5","Scene: A corridor at the university"
"5","Raj: It was a nice retirement party."
"5","Howard: I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down."
"5","Leonard: What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time."
"5","Howard: I wonder how long Sheldon’s got."
"5","Sheldon: These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in."
"5","Leonard: Can’t be very long."
"5","Raj: Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad."
"5","Leonard: Yeah."
"5","Sheldon: Mm, indeed."
"5","Howard: So sad."
"5","Sheldon: Dibs."
"5","Kripke: What’s up, fewwas?"
"5","Sheldon: What are you doing here, Kripke?"
"5","Kripke: Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes."
"5","Sheldon: This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet."
"5","Kripke: Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box."
"5","Sheldon: Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs."
"5","Leonard: You just called dibs."
"5","Sheldon: Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first."
"5","Kripke: I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy bird."
"5","Rothman (entering, naked): Gentlemen."
"5","All: Professor Rothman."
"5","Rothman: Good evening."
"5","All: Good evening."
"5","Raj: I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Amy: I got you a little something."
"5","Penny: A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge."
"5","Amy: What’s huge is what you’ve done for me."
"5","Penny: Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything."
"5","Amy: No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it."
"5","Penny: Okay. (Opens parcel to find a huge and not at all flattering painting of Penny and Amy)"
"5","Amy: I wanted to get you something you didn’t have."
"5","Penny: Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow."
"5","Amy: Do you like it?"
"5","Penny: Do I like it? Wow."
"5","Amy: So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?"
"5","Penny: Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…"
"5","Amy: No problem."
"5","Penny: Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow."
"5","Scene: A bathroom at the university."
"5","Sheldon: I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?"
"5","Siebert: Can’t this wait?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m sorry. We just need a word."
"5","Siebert: Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my penis?"
"5","Kripke: Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This guy’s got no wespect for boundawies."
"5","Siebert: What do you want?"
"5","Kripke: Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s office is wightfully mine?"
"5","Siebert: Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?"
"5","Sheldon: We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut."
"5","Siebert: Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish here, and I’m having trouble doing it."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first."
"5","Kripke: Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam."
"5","Siebert: Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind."
"5","Kripke: Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a weak."
"5","Sheldon: Kripke?"
"5","Kripke: Yes?"
"5","Sheldon: You’re in my spot."
"5","Bernadette: That is big."
"5","Penny: So big."
"5","Bernadette: And ugly."
"5","Penny: So ugly. What am I gonna do?"
"5","Bernadette: I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face."
"5","Penny: Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?"
"5","Bernadette: That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?"
"5","Penny: All right, it’s got to go."
"5","Bernadette: What will you tell Amy?"
"5","Penny: How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?"
"5","Bernadette: Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough."
"5","Penny: Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy."
"5","Bernadette: Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Raj: Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick."
"5","Howard: It’s numbered."
"5","Raj: Ooh, limited edition. Nice."
"5","Sheldon (knock on door): Oh, that’ll be Kripke."
"5","Leonard: What’s he doing here?"
"5","Sheldon: We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea."
"5","Kripke: Cooper."
"5","Sheldon: Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?"
"5","Kripke: Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea. Wet’s get down to bwass tacks."
"5","Sheldon: Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…"
"5","Kripke: We’re not fwiends."
"5","Sheldon: Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that."
"5","Kripke: How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a wemon?"
"5","Sheldon: You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?"
"5","Raj: How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?"
"5","Kripke: What the fwig is that?"
"5","Sheldon: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass."
"5","All: Hail."
"5","Kripke: How does it work?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
"5","Kripke: I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
"5","Kripke: Almost got it. One more time."
"5","Sheldon: Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…"
"5","Howard: Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you."
"5","Sheldon: Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things."
"5","Howard: It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel."
"5","Leonard: H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?"
"5","Sheldon: Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains."
"5","Kripke: You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet."
"5","Leonard: It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at."
"5","Raj: Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?"
"5","Both: Sports."
"5","Scene: A basketball court."
"5","Leonard: All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?"
"5","Sheldon: Five what?"
"5","Leonard: Balls in the basket. (Throws ball to Sheldon)"
"5","Sheldon (dodging out of the way): Ew!"
"5","Later. Sheldon dribbling ball, approached Kripke, throws it wildly at a pile of mats in the corner."
"5","Kripke: It’s out, wight?"
"5","Later. Kripke, dribbling ball, watched by Sheldon, dribbles it all the way into the back wall."
"5","Kripke: Time. Wan out of woom."
"5","Leonard: You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?"
"5","Raj: Yeah."
"5","Leonard: I get it."
"5","Later. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased by Kripke."
"5","Later. Ball hits Sheldon in back of head."
"5","Sheldon: Hey! He did that on purpose,"
"5","Leonard: No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office."
"5","Kripke: Making it too easy there, Hofstadter."
"5","Leonard: No. No, I’m not."
"5","Sheldon: Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. (Throws ball. It goes about two feet in front of him.) I’m gonna need more force."
"5","Kripke: Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn’t come down.) Do I get points for that?"
"5","Later. A trampoline has been added. Sheldon tries first, ball hits backboard, bounces back in his face. Kripke tries next, with a run up, ends up crashing into the back wall again."
"5","Later."
"5","Leonard: All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else."
"5","Sheldon: What do you propose?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office."
"5","Kripke: Oh, you are going down, Cooper."
"5","Sheldon: I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day."
"5","Leonard: All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three."
"5","Howard: Sheldon was higher."
"5","Leonard: Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office."
"5","Sheldon: Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?"
"5","Amy: Oh, what a great movie."
"5","Penny: I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease."
"5","Amy: My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang."
"5","Bernadette: I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring."
"5","Amy: I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny."
"5","Penny: Good night, real Amy."
"5","Amy: You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving."
"5","Bernadette: Good night, real Penny."
"5","Penny: Bye."
"5","Bernadette: Good night, transvestite Penny."
"5","Penny: Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish."
"5","Amy (entering): You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running."
"5","Penny: Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye."
"5","Amy: Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?"
"5","Penny: It’s right over there."
"5","Amy: Why?"
"5","Penny: I have no idea. That is weird."
"5","Amy: You hate it."
"5","Penny: No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big."
"5","Amy: I feel like an idiot."
"5","Penny: No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up."
"5","Amy: Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity."
"5","Penny: Oh, Amy, come on."
"5","Amy: I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture."
"5","Scene: Rothman’s office."
"5","Sheldon: Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them."
"5","Raj: I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time."
"5","Raj: Thank you."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah. Call first. (Pushes him out. Closes door. Rothman is standing naked behind it.)"
"5","Rothman: Oh. Hello."
"5","Sheldon: Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired."
"5","Rothman: I think the word you’re looking for is invisible."
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"5","Penny: I came to say I’m sorry."
"5","Amy: Don’t bother."
"5","Penny: Oh, Amy, please."
"5","Amy: I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting."
"5","Penny: I know."
"5","Amy: I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong."
"5","Penny: You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much."
"5","Amy: Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me."
"5","Penny: I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another."
"5","Amy: I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number."
"5","Penny: Amy, come on…"
"5","Amy: If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand."
"5","Penny: Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life."
"5","Amy: I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now."
"5","Penny: Grab your hammer."
"5","Amy: No. Damage is done."
"5","Penny: Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous."
"5","Amy: Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool."
"5","Penny: Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…"
"5","Amy: You have such a good heart."
"5","Penny: Huh, I try."
"5","Amy: Come on."
"5","Penny: Well where are we going?"
"5","Amy: We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment."
"5","Penny: Well, what about Bernadette?"
"5","Amy: Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us."
"5","Scene: Rothman’s office. Sheldon is trying to affix paper over a fiercely blowing air vent."
"5","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt."
"5","Howard: Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?"
"5","Sheldon: Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause."
"5","Leonard: Why is there a hole here?"
"5","Sheldon: Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out."
"5","Raj: Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice."
"5","Sheldon: Is it? Listen."
"5","Raj: What, you don’t like wind chimes?"
"5","Sheldon: No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is."
"5","Howard: The bird?"
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes."
"5","Raj: So?"
"5","Sheldon: You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?"
"5","Howard: The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep."
"5","Sheldon: No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!"
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, relax."
"5","Sheldon: How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman."
"5","Leonard: If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?"
"5","Sheldon: What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! (To the bird) And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!"
"5","Penny: How’s that?"
"5","Amy: Little higher on the right."
"5","Penny: Now?"
"5","Amy: Little more. No. That’s got it."
"5","Penny: Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good."
"5","Amy: I’ll let you in on a little secret."
"5","Penny: Mm."
"5","Amy: Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality."
"5","Penny: Yeah, good call."
"5","Amy: But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges."
"5","Penny: You’re talking about the painting, right?"
"5","Amy: Sure."
"5","Scene: Rothman’s office. Sheldon has his head stuck in the hole in the wall."
"5","Sheldon: Help! Somebody help!"
"5","Leonard: What happened?"
"5","Sheldon: I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck."
"5","Leonard: Why would you do that?"
"5","Sheldon: It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter."
"5","Leonard: Hang in there. I’ll be right back. (Takes out phone and takes a photo. Sits down and starts posting it online.)"
"5","Series 05 Episode 18 – The Werewolf Transformation"
"5","Scene: A barber’s shop."
"5","Leonard: I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done."
"5","Sheldon: Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right."
"5","Barber: Hey, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio."
"5","Barber: I’m sorry, Uncle Tony’s in the hospital. He’s pretty sick."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, dear, Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?"
"5","Barber: I can cut it for you."
"5","Sheldon: You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?"
"5","Leonard: Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber."
"5","Sheldon: He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas."
"5","Leonard: What are you talking about?"
"5","Sheldon: When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio."
"5","Leonard: There’s no such thing as haircut records."
"5","Sheldon: Yes, there are."
"5","Leonard: Have you ever seen them?"
"5","Sheldon: No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?"
"5","Barber: Your what?"
"5","Sheldon: To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it."
"5","Sheldon: Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you. (Sits)"
"5","Barber: So my kid said the funniest thing today."
"5","Sheldon: Nope. (Runs out)"
"5","Leonard: When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Sheldon: Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?"
"5","Leonard: Sure. What are you doing?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut."
"5","Sheldon: Thank you for captioning my nightmare."
"5","Howard: Lookie here, I got my travel orders."
"5","Raj: Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m."
"5","Howard: Yeah, but it’s from NASA, so it’s oh eight hundred."
"5","Raj: But it says eight a.m."
"5","Howard: You read it as oh eight hundred."
"5","Raj: It doesn’t have an oh in front of it."
"5","Howard: You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy."
"5","Leonard: So, what kind of things are they… (to Sheldon) will you stop that?"
"5","Sheldon: I can’t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob."
"5","Penny: You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you."
"5","Sheldon: Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…"
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, be nice."
"5","Sheldon: I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
"5","Raj: You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza."
"5","Howard: Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I’m going"
"5","to astronaut training to Sheldon can’t get a haircut?"
"5","Raj: Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you."
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing her harp."
"5","Amy: I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I’m wanted… I’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night."
"5","Sheldon: I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it."
"5","Amy: What about Supercuts?"
"5","Sheldon: I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse."
"5","Amy: Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?"
"5","Sheldon: Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?"
"5","Amy: Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while."
"5","Scene: Bernadette’s bedroom."
"5","Howard (on Skype): Hi."
"5","Bernadette: Hi, sweetie."
"5","Howard: I miss you."
"5","Bernadette: I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day."
"5","Howard: Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity."
"5","Bernadette: Cool. How do they do that?"
"5","Howard: It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up."
"5","Bernadette: You threw up?"
"5","Howard: Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens."
"5","Bernadette: That sounds mean."
"5","Howard: No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?"
"5","Bernadette: Sure, why?"
"5","Howard: I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light."
"5","Scene: A hospital ward."
"5","Sheldon: Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors."
"5","Nurse: Can I help you?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?"
"5","Nurse: Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, no, no, I’m just here to get my hair cut."
"5","Nurse: I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!"
"5","Sheldon: I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe."
"5","Penny: So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and I win?"
"5","Leonard: Hmm."
"5","Penny: Well, is it or isn’t it?"
"5","Leonard: You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you."
"5","Penny: Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy."
"5","Leonard: Like I said, complicated game."
"5","Penny: So did I win or not?"
"5","Leonard: Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about."
"5","Sheldon: Hello."
"5","Leonard: Hey."
"5","Penny: Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move."
"5","Sheldon: Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?"
"5","Penny: Okay, what just happened?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events."
"5","Penny: Uh, sweetie, are you all right?"
"5","Sheldon: No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened."
"5","Penny: Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, explain it to her."
"5","Leonard: Oh, uh, he’s crazy."
"5","Sheldon: I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, I’ve been wasting my time."
"5","Leonard: Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge."
"5","Penny: You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point."
"5","Leonard: I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit."
"5","Sheldon: You’re right. I should embrace the chaos."
"5","Leonard: Great. What are you going to do first?"
"5","Sheldon: I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight."
"5","Leonard: I got to tell you, I’m a little worried about him."
"5","Penny: If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass."
"5","Bernadette: Howie, what happened to you?"
"5","Howard: We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom."
"5","Bernadette: Survival training? Is that like camping?"
"5","Howard: Uh-huh. Except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer."
"5","Bernadette: Do you sleep in tents?"
"5","Howard: No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me."
"5","Bernadette: Poor baby."
"5","Howard: But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost."
"5","Bernadette: You’re so brave. I’m proud of you."
"5","Howard: I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry."
"5","Bernadette: Are you crying?"
"5","Howard: No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste."
"5","Bernadette: Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you."
"5","Howard: Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up."
"5","Bernadette: Well, is there anything I could do to help?"
"5","Howard: No. Wait. Send more underwear."
"5","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Leonard wakes to the sound of bongos."
"5","Leonard (going to living room): Don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos."
"5","Sheldon: Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning."
"5","Sheldon: Three in the morning is a good time for bongos."
"5","Leonard: I was sleeping."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard sleeps while I play bongos."
"5","Leonard: No, he doesn’t."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo."
"5","Leonard: Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!"
"5","Penny (entering): What the hell?!"
"5","Leonard: Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos."
"5","Penny: Why did you get bongos?"
"5","Sheldon: Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try."
"5","Leonard: Richard Feynman was a famous physicist."
"5","Penny: Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt."
"5","Sheldon: Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning."
"5","Sheldon: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world."
"5","Leonard: W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m."
"5","Sheldon: Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement."
"5","Penny: Where are you going?"
"5","Sheldon: Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. (Sound of falling) Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs."
"5","Scene: Howard’s hotel room. There is a knock on the door."
"5","Bernadette: Surprise."
"5","Howard: What are you doing here?"
"5","Bernadette: I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you."
"5","Howard: Oh, I love you so much."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, I love you."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your bath is getting cold!"
"5","Howard: Don’t worry, once she falls asleep, I’ll spoon you like an armadillo."
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"5","Amy: He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call."
"5","Leonard: Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!"
"5","Amy: That was kind of uncalled for."
"5","Leonard: No, it was called for."
"5","Sheldon: What’s going on?"
"5","Penny: All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair."
"5","Sheldon: Penny, you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records."
"5","Penny: All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once."
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry, duh, what?"
"5","Penny: It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair."
"5","Sheldon: Amy, what do you think?"
"5","Amy: There’s not a hair on my body I wouldn’t let this woman trim."
"5","Sheldon: Fine, let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch."
"5","Amy: There’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?"
"5","Leonard: What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny is cutting Sheldon’s hair."
"5","Penny: Almost done."
"5","Sheldon: At the end of the haircut, Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke."
"5","Penny: Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes."
"5","Sheldon: That’s okay, I never understood them anyway."
"5","Penny: Okay, what do you think?"
"5","Sheldon: Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny."
"5","Penny: Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go."
"5","Sheldon: Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me."
"5","Penny: Okay. (Sheldon laughs and jerks, Penny accidentally shaves a strip up the back of his head) Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay."
"5","Sgeldon: Thank you very much."
"5","Penny: You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move."
"5","Series 05 Episode 19 – The Weekend Vortex"
"5","Scene: The stairwell"
"5","Raj: Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?"
"5","Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise."
"5","Howard: You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs."
"5","Leonard: Good point, I’m in."
"5","Raj: You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days."
"5","Leonard: You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?"
"5","Raj: Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food."
"5","Howard: Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call."
"5","Leonard: It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us."
"5","Howard: They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead."
"5","Raj: We were badass back in the day."
"5","Leonard: All right, let’s do it."
"5","Howard: 48 hours of Star Wars gaming."
"5","Raj: It’s on like Alderaan."
"5","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon"
"5","Raj: Woo-hoo!"
"5","Sheldon: Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!"
"5","Leonard: We are going to play the online game."
"5","Sheldon: The online game? Bully!"
"5","Amy: Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party."
"5","Sheldon: Just tell her I can’t come."
"5","Amy: She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up."
"5","Sheldon: She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long."
"5","Amy: No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none."
"5","Sheldon: Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way."
"5","Amy: You use it to get your way."
"5","Sheldon: I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence."
"5","Amy: You gave me your word. You’re coming with me."
"5","Leonard: We’ll miss you, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies."
"5","Howard: Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!"
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The comic book store."
"5","Sheldon: Hello Stuart."
"5","Stuart: Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?"
"5","Stuart: Uh, I don’t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane."
"5","Sheldon: Do you supply the the tennis ball?"
"5","Stuart: No."
"5","Sheldon: Then no. What else?"
"5","Stuart: Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy."
"5","Sheldon: Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume."
"5","Stuart: I’m sorry Sheldon, that’s it. That’s all I got."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for."
"5","Leonard: I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems."
"5","Sheldon: No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom."
"5","Leonard: That’s what your father used to say?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist."
"5","Howard: Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller."
"5","Raj: I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale."
"5","Howard: Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. (Phone makes whip sound)"
"5","Sheldon: You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Leonard: Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed."
"5","Penny: You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want."
"5","Leonard: Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
"5","Penny: Really, what were you hoping for?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little."
"5","Penny: Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again."
"5","Leonard: Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?"
"5","Penny: Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi."
"5","Leonard: Ay papi? What is that?"
"5","Penny: An acting choice."
"5","Leonard: Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?"
"5","Penny: Choo got a problem with that, papi?"
"5","Leonard: Uh-uh."
"5","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny!"
"5","Penny: Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here."
"5","Sheldon: Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift."
"5","Penny: Gummy bears? Thank you."
"5","Sheldon: Now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party."
"5","Penny: Not a chance."
"5","Sheldon: All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes."
"5","Leonard: Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I’ve been burned more than once."
"5","Penny: All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in your relationship."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now, when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?"
"5","Penny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it."
"5","Sheldon: When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?"
"5","Sheldon: All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B."
"5","Penny: What’s that?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold."
"5","Scene: Amy’s car."
"5","Amy: Good morning."
"5","Sheldon: Hello."
"5","Amy: I think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It’s like a vacation for your teeth."
"5","Sheldon: All right."
"5","Amy: You sure you’re okay with this?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it."
"5","Amy: Thank you. That means a lot to me."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends."
"5","Amy: Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying."
"5","Amy: You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game."
"5","Sheldon: Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Raj: Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs."
"5","Leonard: You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one."
"5","Raj: Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much."
"5","Sheldon: Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side."
"5","Leonard: Well, we’re always the good guys. In D&D, we’re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we’re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat."
"5","Sheldon: Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research."
"5","Howard: Hey, guys, I got a surprise."
"5","Leonard: Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it."
"5","Howard: No. Bernadette’s going to be playing with us. So, that’s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah."
"5","Raj: What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend."
"5","Howard: I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now."
"5","Sheldon: Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?"
"5","Leonard: Uh, it is, but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny. (Whip sound) I was wrong, it’s still funny."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, good. Hah-hah!"
"5","Penny: Amy, what’s wrong?"
"5","Amy: My boyfriend’s a jerk."
"5","Penny: Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?"
"5","Amy: I had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?"
"5","Penny: Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?"
"5","Amy: The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?"
"5","Penny: I would have thought at a miniature horse show."
"5","Amy: Oh, that’s good."
"5","Penny: Mm."
"5","Amy: I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family."
"5","Penny: Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all."
"5","Amy: Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper."
"5","Penny: Yes. On purpose."
"5","Amy: He’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
"5","Penny: Well, sickly is the new sexy."
"5","Amy: Yeah."
"5","Penny: Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
"5","Amy: Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?"
"5","Penny: That’s hilarious. No."
"5","Bernadette: Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!"
"5","Sheldon: Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go."
"5","Bernadette: Pew!"
"5","Leonard: Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail."
"5","Raj: Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff."
"5","Leonard: All right, I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot."
"5","Bernadette: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match."
"5","Howard: But I worked hard to get this armour."
"5","Bernadette: Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple."
"5","Howard: Fine, I’ll change. (Whip sound)"
"5","Sheldon: Hah-hah!"
"5","Amy: I don’t think I want to play a game."
"5","Penny: Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…"
"5","Amy: Like that?"
"5","Penny: Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?"
"5","Amy: Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting."
"5","Penny: Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. (Sound of cheering)"
"5","Amy: That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me."
"5","Penny: Wars."
"5","Amy: What?"
"5","Penny: Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up."
"5","Amy: What’s the difference?"
"5","Penny: There’s absolutely no difference."
"5","Amy: How do I get him to treat me better?"
"5","Penny: All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment."
"5","Amy: No, he loves that."
"5","Penny: Hmm."
"5","Amy: Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening."
"5","Penny: All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene."
"5","Amy: I don’t think I’d be good at that."
"5","Penny: That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s."
"5","Raj: Bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard."
"5","Bernadette: I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie."
"5","Sheldon: That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine."
"5","Amy (bursting in): Sheldon Cooper, I’ve got a bone to pick with you, and I’m about to do it in front of all your friends."
"5","Penny: Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!"
"5","Amy: I’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour."
"5","Penny: Ooh, burn!"
"5","Amy: And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin."
"5","Sheldon: Armin who?"
"5","Amy: Armin… damn it."
"5","Penny: Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush."
"5","Amy: You’re hurting me."
"5","Penny: No, Sheldon hurt you."
"5","Amy: Before; now it’s you."
"5","Penny: Oh."
"5","Sheldon: I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution."
"5","Penny: Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…"
"5","Amy: Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let’s go."
"5","Sheldon: Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. (Whip sound) Oh, grow up, Leonard."
"5","Raj: But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!"
"5","Penny: And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go."
"5","Amy: What about the Science Center?"
"5","Penny: I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up."
"5","Amy: Rain check."
"5","Bernadette: I’m gonna go, too."
"5","Howard: I’ll miss you."
"5","Bernadette: I’ll miss you."
"5","Howard: I’ll miss you more."
"5","Bernadette: No, I’ll…"
"5","Raj: Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil."
"5","All: Hear! Hear!"
"5","Raj: I can’t believe this is only 64 calories."
"5","Scene: Some time later. The guys are asleep."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard Joel Wolowitz! I’ve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I’ve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!"
"5","Howard: That’s my ride, got to go. (Whip sound)"
"5","Series 05 Episode 20 – The Transporter Malfunction"
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Penny: Oh my God, I love this chicken."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free."
"5","Penny: Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking."
"5","Howard: Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding."
"5","Raj: I’ll let you know."
"5","Howard: Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home."
"5","Leonard: Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding."
"5","Sheldon: They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts."
"5","Howard: Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck."
"5","Raj: Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one."
"5","Leonard: Who you bringing?"
"5","Raj: Who are you bringing?"
"5","Penny: He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?"
"5","Raj: Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells."
"5","Howard: Come on, who is it?"
"5","Raj: I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it."
"5","Sheldon: Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?"
"5","Howard: No, uh, I don’t think so."
"5","Sheldon: Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"5","Raj (on skype): Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?"
"5","Mrs Koothrappali: Pretty good, can’t complain."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute."
"5","Raj: Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?"
"5","Mrs Koothrappali: We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself."
"5","Raj: No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: What’s that?"
"5","Raj: It means I like women as well as their skincare products."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: Well, if you’re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?"
"5","Raj: ‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife."
"5","Mrs Koothrappali: And just to clarify, a female wife?"
"5","Raj: Yes."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love."
"5","Mrs Koothrappali: We married for love."
"5","Dr Koothrappali: And it’s been wonderful."
"5","Sheldon: Quantum physics makes me so happy."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, I’m glad."
"5","Sheldon: It’s like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers)"
"5","Penny: Hi, you guys got a minute?"
"5","Leonard: Sure, what’s up?"
"5","Penny: Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up."
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes."
"5","Leonard: Prove it."
"5","Sheldon: Knock, knock."
"5","Leonard: Who’s there?"
"5","Sheldon: Interrupting physicist."
"5","Leonard: Interrupting physi…"
"5","Sheldon: MUON!"
"5","Penny: Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!"
"5","Sheldon: Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!"
"5","Leonard: Where did you get that?"
"5","Penny: Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store."
"5","Leonard: You went to the comic-book store by yourself?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good."
"5","Sheldon: Well this calls for an expression of gratitude."
"5","Penny: Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?"
"5","Sheldon: Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny."
"5","Penny: You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker."
"5","Leonard: Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box."
"5","Penny: Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!"
"5","Leonard: Awesome!"
"5","Sheldon: Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure."
"5","Penny: Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there."
"5","Leonard: Ah!"
"5","Sheldon: Oh dear Lord. No!"
"5","Penny: Why, they’re just toys?"
"5","Sheldon: They’re mint in box."
"5","Leonard: They’re Collectables."
"5","Penny: C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…"
"5","Together: No!"
"5","Leonard: Once you open the box it loses its value."
"5","Penny: Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it."
"5","Scene: A restaurant."
"5","Bernadette: Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?"
"5","Raj: Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two."
"5","Bernadette: The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit."
"5","Howard: Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow."
"5","Raj: Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here."
"5","Howard: Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox."
"5","Raj: It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox."
"5","Howard: Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins."
"5","Bernadette: So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?"
"5","Raj: Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth."
"5","Girl: Excuse me, are you Rajesh?"
"5","Raj: Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you."
"5","Lakshmi: Nice to meet you too."
"5","Raj: Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette."
"5","Bernadette: Hello."
"5","Raj: And this is Howard."
"5","Howard: Nice to meet you."
"5","Lakshmi: You too."
"5","Raj: Please have a seat. (To Bernadette) I’m thinking double wedding!"
"5","Voice of Spock: Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?"
"5","Sheldon: Is someone there?"
"5","Spock: Down here, on your desk."
"5","Sheldon: Spock?"
"5","Spock: I need to speak with you."
"5","Sheldon: Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream."
"5","Spock: It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut."
"5","Sheldon: Was I hit on the head by a coconut."
"5","Spock: I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy."
"5","Sheldon: But it’s mint in box."
"5","Spock: Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half."
"5","Sheldon: Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response."
"5","Spock: Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?"
"5","Sheldon: To be played with."
"5","Spock: Therefore? To not play with it would be?"
"5","Sheldon: Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it."
"5","Spock: Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard’s toy) It’s only logical."
"5","Lakshmi: My goodness, that was delicious."
"5","Raj: Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake."
"5","Lakshmi: Impressive. What goes into making something like that."
"5","Raj: Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake."
"5","Lakshmi: I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here."
"5","Raj: Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls."
"5","Lakshmi: Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them."
"5","Raj: I’d like to tell them things are going well."
"5","Lakshmi: Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page."
"5","Raj: Okay, what page are you on?"
"5","Lakshmi: I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay."
"5","Raj: Say again."
"5","Lakshmi: I’m gay."
"5","Raj: Like, dude on dude, but with women?"
"5","Lakshmi: I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture."
"5","Raj: Why me, of all people?"
"5","Lakshmi: Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari."
"5","Raj: I’m not gay."
"5","Lakshmi: Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am."
"5","Raj: That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex."
"5","Lakshmi: Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?"
"5","Raj: I like to boogie."
"5","Lakshmi: Got you."
"5","Raj: W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women."
"5","Lakshmi: That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for."
"5","Raj: Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it."
"5","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon writhes in bed, then wakes up on an alien planet."
"5","Sheldon: Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen."
"5","Spock: Hello again, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: What is it now, tiny Spock?"
"5","Spock: I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself."
"5","Sheldon: You’re the one who told me to play with it."
"5","Spock: If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?"
"5","Sheldon: No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave."
"5","Spock: Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy."
"5","Spock: Well I am unhappy."
"5","Sheldon: I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions."
"5","Spock: I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing."
"5","Sheldon: You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here."
"5","Spock: Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it."
"5","Sheldon: Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get’s attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help."
"5","Scene: Howard’s laboratory. Howard is soldering something."
"5","Raj: Ready for lunch?"
"5","Howard: Yep, one sec. (Puts thing in mouth.) Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer."
"5","Raj: Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi."
"5","Howard: Yeah. Sure. How are things going?"
"5","Raj: We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian."
"5","Howard: What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?"
"5","Raj: Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true."
"5","Howard: Then why did she even go out with you?"
"5","Raj: She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it."
"5","Howard: Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy."
"5","Raj: Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises."
"5","Howard: Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s."
"5","Raj: It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go."
"5","Howard: Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you."
"5","Raj: Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does."
"5","Howard: So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with."
"5","Raj: I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married."
"5","Howard: Yes, to other gay people."
"5","Raj: Do you hear how homophobic you sound?"
"5","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is working on his laptop. Spock is looking at him judgementally. He switches the two toys."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!"
"5","Leonard: What?"
"5","Sheldon: Nothing. I said nothing."
"5","Penny: That was weird."
"5","Leonard: Really? I don’t even notice any more."
"5","Penny: I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these."
"5","Leonard: Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box."
"5","Penny: I dunno. I just think it’s a waste. (Picks up box. Sheldon screams.) Relax. I’m just looking at the box."
"5","Sheldon: Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands."
"5","Penny: What is your problem?"
"5","Sheldon: My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her."
"5","Penny: Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box."
"5","Leonard: You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it."
"5","Penny: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: Mmmmm!"
"5","Leonard: It’s broken."
"5","Penny: What?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, nice job, man-hands."
"5","Penny: I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this."
"5","Sheldon: Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart."
"5","Penny: You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him."
"5","Leonard: Absolutely."
"5","Sheldon: Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you."
"5","Leonard: Why would you open mine?"
"5","Sheldon: I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them."
"5","Leonard: Well, you should talk to Stuart."
"5","Sheldon: I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie."
"5","Penny: What is the truth?"
"5","Sheldon: My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn."
"5","Leonard: Okay, that I believe."
"5","Penny: Mmm."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie."
"5","Leonard: So, is that one mine."
"5","Leonard: Well, hand it over so I can open it."
"5","Sheldon: Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it."
"5","Leonard: And that’s a lie, right?"
"5","Sheldon: Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks."
"5","Raj: This is a treat, what brings you guys by?"
"5","Bernadette: Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi."
"5","Raj: What, you told her?"
"5","Howard: I told everybody."
"5","Bernadette: We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you."
"5","Howard: Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman."
"5","Raj: So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone."
"5","Bernadette: Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with. (Pulls a puppy out of her bag.)"
"5","Raj: Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?"
"5","Howard: Her. We thought you two would hit it off."
"5","Raj: I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse."
"5","Bernadette: Metrosexual my ass."
"5","Series 05 Episode 21 – The Hawking Excitation"
"5","Scene: The cafeteria."
"5","Howard: So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning."
"5","Raj: I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work."
"5","Howard: Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking."
"5","Leonard: You’re kidding."
"5","Raj: Why?"
"5","Howard: He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair."
"5","Leonard: That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him."
"5","Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice): You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive."
"5","Raj: Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, he worships Hawking."
"5","Howard: I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man."
"5","Raj: That’s really nice of you, Howard."
"5","Howard: Hm, it’s no big deal."
"5","Leonard: Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?"
"5","Leonard: Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?"
"5","Sheldon: Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it."
"5","Leonard: Really?"
"5","Raj: That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you."
"5","Howard: Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics."
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it."
"5","Raj: Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?"
"5","Howard: Yep."
"5","Leonard: Still going to introduce him?"
"5","Howard: Not on your life."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: A corridor."
"5","Sheldon: Please, please, please let me meet Hawking."
"5","Howard: I told you, no."
"5","Sheldon: But I said I’m sorry."
"5","Howard: No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?"
"5","Sheldon: And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?"
"5","Howard: Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?"
"5","Sheldon: Um, to go to Jewish heaven?"
"5","Howard: Jews don’t have heaven."
"5","Sheldon: Then to avoid Jewish hell?"
"5","Howard: Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell."
"5","Sheldon: Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal."
"5","Howard: Oh, you can’t be serious."
"5","Sheldon: Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being."
"5","Howard: Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?"
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps."
"5","Howard: Get out of my lab."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?"
"5","Howard: Get out."
"5","Sheldon: How about dolphins?"
"5","Howard: Out!"
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Leonard: So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?"
"5","Howard: It was great. We talked about movies."
"5","Sheldon: Oh!"
"5","Howard: I showed him some card tricks."
"5","Howard: He even let me read a couple pages from his new book."
"5","Howard: Something got you down there, bunky?"
"5","Sheldon: Howard, please, I’m begging you."
"5","Leonard: Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?"
"5","Raj: Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly."
"5","Sheldon: Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween."
"5","Howard: You’re kidding."
"5","Sheldon: No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy."
"5","Howard: You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111."
"5","Sheldon: It’s actually 01100111."
"5","Howard: No!"
"5","Sheldon: I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking."
"5","Howard: Let me try gansta, hells no."
"5","Sheldon: Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me."
"5","Leonard: What if he doesn’t?"
"5","Sheldon: He will, he’s really smart."
"5","Howard: That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?"
"5","Sheldon: How do I do that?"
"5","Howard: You walk away."
"5","Sheldon: Walking away."
"5","Leonard: You do realize you own his ass right now."
"5","Howard: I do."
"5","Raj: You can make him do anything you want."
"5","Howard: Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him."
"5","Raj: Well, don’t be too mean."
"5","Sheldon: Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."
"5","Raj: I wouldn’t mind a glass."
"5","Sheldon: I wasn’t talking to you."
"5","Raj: Bring him to his bony knees."
"5","Howard: Sheldon, come on back."
"5","Sheldon: Yes, yes. What did you decide?"
"5","Howard: I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking."
"5","Sheldon: Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific."
"5","Howard: But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me."
"5","Sheldon: What kinds of things?"
"5","Howard: Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?"
"5","Sheldon: Of course."
"5","Howard: You should be so lucky."
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"5","Sheldon: All right. What would you like me to do first?"
"5","Howard: Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles."
"5","Sheldon: Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."
"5","Howard: That’s nice."
"5","Sheldon: That’s a lot of belt buckles."
"5","Howard: Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back."
"5","Sheldon: You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that."
"5","Howard: Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room."
"5","(Later)"
"5","Howard: Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off."
"5","Howard: Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud."
"5","Sheldon: My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?"
"5","Howard: Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong."
"5","Sheldon: And you want me to return it for you?"
"5","Howard: No, no, no, mon petit cherie."
"5","Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon enters in the French maid costume."
"5","Sheldon: What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?"
"5","Scene: The laundry room."
"5","Penny: Hey."
"5","Sheldon: Hello."
"5","Penny: It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?"
"5","Sheldon: This is not my laundry."
"5","Penny: Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her."
"5","Sheldon: Those are Howard’s."
"5","Penny: Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?"
"5","Sheldon: Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist."
"5","Penny: Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time."
"5","Sheldon: That’s close enough."
"5","Penny: I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?"
"5","Sheldon: Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?"
"5","Penny: Well…"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…"
"5","Penny: I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down."
"5","Sheldon: Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone."
"5","Penny: Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet."
"5","Sheldon: Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay."
"5","Penny: See, there it is, there’s that twinkle."
"5","Sheldon: Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle."
"5","Penny: What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?"
"5","Sheldon: I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason."
"5","Penny: Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason."
"5","Sheldon: I knew it."
"5","Howard: What’s the matter?"
"5","Bernadette: Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im."
"5","Howard: It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, my God, that’s terrible."
"5","Howard: Hey, I gave you first crack at it."
"5","Bernadette: Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him."
"5","Howard: He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate."
"5","Bernadette: If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great."
"5","Howard: Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine."
"5","Bernadette: It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain."
"5","Howard: Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop."
"5","Bernadette: No, you have to stop now."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him."
"5","Scene: A shop changing rooms."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Sheldon! I need your help!"
"5","Sheldon: What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!"
"5","Sheldon: What do you want me to do?"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): We’re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing."
"5","Sheldon (off): I’m not sure how to do this."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s easy, just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag."
"5","Sheldon (off): Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Now zip me up."
"5","Sheldon (off): Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): You’re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!"
"5","Howard: Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs."
"5","Leonard: What are these?"
"5","Howard: Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?"
"5","Raj: Wow, that’s amazing."
"5","Howard: Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went."
"5","Sheldon: I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."
"5","Howard: I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file."
"5","Sheldon: Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?"
"5","Howard: I don’t know."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
"5","Howard: All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one."
"5","Sheldon: Okay."
"5","Howard: Give me a compliment."
"5","Sheldon: Fine. You have very tiny hands."
"5","Howard: No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do."
"5","Sheldon: You’re obviously good at what you do."
"5","Howard: Well, then why are you always ripping on me?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing."
"5","Leonard: It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run."
"5","Howard: Thank you, Sheldon."
"5","Sheldon: Now will you give my paper to Hawking?"
"5","Howard: Sorry, I can’t."
"5","Sheldon: What, why not?"
"5","Howard: I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you."
"5","Sheldon: All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience."
"5","Raj: I thought he might be a little more excited."
"5","Leonard: Give it a second. (Sound of Sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom)"
"5","Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office."
"5","Sheldon: Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir."
"5","Hawking: I know."
"5","Sheldon: I want to thank you for taking time to see me."
"5","Hawking: My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind."
"5","Sheldon: I know."
"5","Hawking: Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating."
"5","Sheldon: Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower."
"5","Hawking: That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong."
"5","Sheldon: What do you mean wrong?"
"5","Hawking: You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner."
"5","Sheldon: No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes."
"5","Hawking: Are you saying I do?"
"5","Sheldon: Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking."
"5","Hawking: Great, another fainter."
"5","Series 05 Episode 22 – The Stag Convergence"
"5","Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon laughs to himself."
"5","Sheldon: I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it."
"5","Raj: Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having."
"5","Sheldon: Wrong. Leonard?"
"5","Leonard: Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth."
"5","Sheldon: Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?"
"5","Howard: Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball."
"5","Leonard: Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body."
"5","Sheldon: Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad."
"5","Leonard: Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful."
"5","Sheldon: All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll just snack on this sunlight."
"5","Raj: He got us again."
"5","Leonard: No, he didn’t."
"5","Raj: Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party."
"5","Sheldon: Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan."
"5","Raj: I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs."
"5","Howard: Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers."
"5","Raj: You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you."
"5","Howard: What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more."
"5","Leonard: Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still, you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special."
"5","Sheldon: You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom."
"5","Howard: Well, it’s probably not for me."
"5","Raj: Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train."
"5","Sheldon: Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in."
"5","Raj: Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic."
"5","Leonard: Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: The stairwell."
"5","Penny: So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about."
"5","Penny: Why should I worry?"
"5","Leonard: Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?"
"5","Penny: Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."
"5","Leonard: Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff."
"5","Penny: Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count."
"5","Leonard: Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died."
"5","Penny: Well, have fun tonight."
"5","Leonard: Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen."
"5","Penny: Yeah, there is."
"5","Leonard: You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s."
"5","Scene: A restaurant."
"5","Leonard: Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party."
"5","Sheldon: It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks."
"5","Leonard: Are you drinking whisky?"
"5","Sheldon: Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky."
"5","Leonard: Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don’t you think?"
"5","Wil Wheaton: Hey, you guys."
"5","Leonard: Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard."
"5","Wil: Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei’s house."
"5","Sheldon: I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group."
"5","Wil: Oh, I’m friends with Howard too."
"5","Sheldon: Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody. (Drinks) Aagh!"
"5","Stuart: Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check."
"5","Leonard: Oh, yeah, no worries."
"5","Stuart: And maybe a few bucks for the valet."
"5","Leonard: Oh, all right."
"5","Stuart: And gas money to get home."
"5","Leonard: Yeah, sure."
"5","Stuart: Great. You know what? This is my grandfather’s watch."
"5","Leonard: Oh."
"5","Stuart: 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war."
"5","Leonard: Wow, that’s very nice."
"5","Stuart: Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it’s yours."
"5","Raj: Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…"
"5","All (joining in): For he’s a jolly good fellow, for he’s a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny."
"5","Kripke: Yes, yes, yes. He’s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?"
"5","Howard: Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight."
"5","Kripke: Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?"
"5","Stuart: You want to buy a watch?"
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Amy (into a mini-cam): This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?"
"5","Bernadette: Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation."
"5","Penny: Yeah, we labeled them stop and go."
"5","Amy: All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?"
"5","Bernadette: Amy, please."
"5","Amy: Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage."
"5","Penny: Okay, show’s over."
"5","Amy: Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?"
"5","Penny: I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?"
"5","Bernadette: I’ve actually been thinking I’m going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz."
"5","Penny: Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up."
"5","Bernadette: Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours."
"5","Penny: Oh, that’s cool."
"5","Amy: No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later."
"5","Scene: The restaurant."
"5","Raj: May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz."
"5","All: Hear! Hear!"
"5","Sheldon: And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend."
"5","Wil: Sheldon…"
"5","Sheldon: Talk to the hand."
"5","Raj: Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?"
"5","Sheldon: Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!"
"5","Leonard: Sheldon…"
"5","Sheldon: Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that."
"5","Leonard: So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…"
"5","Kripke: Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up."
"5","Leonard: Right. To Howard."
"5","All: To Howard."
"5","Leonard: I totally had sex in the ocean."
"5","Stuart: Okay, I’ll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can’t help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I’m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard."
"5","Raj: Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who’s next?"
"5","Kripke: I’ll go. Howard, I’m gonna say something to you that evewybody’s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That’s not unweasonable."
"5","Raj: Hear, hear."
"5","All: Hear, hear."
"5","Raj: Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world."
"5","Kripke: Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. (Tucks a dollar in Raj’s pants.)"
"5","Raj: I’m not done, but thank you. (Raj puts the dollar on the table. Stuart steals it.) I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
"5","Howard: She was my second cousin."
"5","Sheldon: And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!"
"5","Raj: Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!"
"5","Howard: Okay, buddy, that’s it. Sit down."
"5","Raj: Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?"
"5","Howard: Don’t remember. Please sit down."
"5","Raj: The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here."
"5","Howard: Oh, please shut up."
"5","Raj: Oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us."
"5","Wil (filming on his phone): Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you."
"5","Sheldon: Jeepers, I’m drunk."
"5","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"5","Howard: Thank you for picking us up. There’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!"
"5","Bernadette: Funny. You boys have a nice time?"
"5","Howard: Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes."
"5","Bernadette: That’s nice."
"5","Howard: How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
"5","Raj’s Voice: Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite."
"5","Raj: You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here."
"5","Bernadette: You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway."
"5","Howard: Bernadette, listen…"
"5","Bernadette: You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!"
"5","Raj: Seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street."
"5","Howard: Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country."
"5","Bernadette: Don’t you try and blame this on him."
"5","Raj: Thank you, Bernadette."
"5","Bernadette: Zip it, pervert!"
"5","Scene: Bernadette’s apartment."
"5","Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m not sure I even know who the man is any more."
"5","Amy: I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?"
"5","Penny: Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?"
"5","Amy: Right. And that was…"
"5","Penny: Not."
"5","Bernadette: When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother."
"5","Penny: Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ’em."
"5","Bernadette: Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?"
"5","Penny: Well, a little. You hear stuff."
"5","Bernadette: Why didn’t you tell me"
"5","Penny: Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you."
"5","Bernadette: My God! I thought you were my friend. (Runs to bedroom)"
"5","Amy: I don’t think that was helpful."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone."
"5","Howard: Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back."
"5","Raj: Dude, I am so sorry."
"5","Howard: It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff, not you."
"5","Leonard: Actually, you did do one of them together."
"5","Sheldon: Here."
"5","Howard: What is this?"
"5","Sheldon: You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage."
"5","Howard: No, but what is it?"
"5","Sheldon: Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds."
"5","Howard: I don’t know what my next move is."
"5","Leonard: Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women."
"5","Howard: Yeah?"
"5","Leonard: No, uh, that, that’s it. I don’t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?"
"5","Raj: I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con."
"5","Howard: I’m not calling the girl from Comic-con."
"5","Raj: All right. More Sailor Moon for me."
"5","Sheldon: I just threw up the bachelor party."
"5","Penny: Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this."
"5","Bernadette: No, leave me alone."
"5","Amy: Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?"
"5","Penny: Amy."
"5","Amy: Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying to clean up your mess."
"5","Howard (at the door): Oh, hi."
"5","Penny: Hey."
"5","Howard: I need to talk to Bernadette."
"5","Penny: Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now."
"5","Howard: All right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, sure, I guess."
"5","Howard: Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you."
"5","Penny: Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you."
"5","Bernadette: Howie?"
"5","Howard: Penny has a message for you."
"5","Bernadette: I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls."
"5","Howard: Do you want me to go?"
"5","Bernadette: No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you."
"5","Howard: I get that."
"5","Bernadette: Is there anything else about your past I should know?"
"5","Howard: Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I’ll tell you later."
"5","Bernadette: Okay."
"5","Howard: So, is the wedding still on?"
"5","Bernadette: Yeah, the wedding’s still on. (They hug)"
"5","Amy: Oh, thank God. I’m still a maid of honour. (Joins in the hug)"
"5","Penny: Oh, what the hell. (Joins in too)"
"5","Amy: This is kind of hot."
"5","Scene: The laundry room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown."
"5","Leonard: Hello."
"5","Penny: What’s with the robe?"
"5","Leonard (taking it off): I’m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine."
"5","Penny: No, you’re not."
"5","Leonard: Come on, please."
"5","Penny: If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet."
"5","Leonard: Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy."
"5","Series 05 Episode 23 – The Launch Acceleration"
"5","Scene: Howard’s laboratory. The phone rings. Howard puts it on speaker."
"5","Howard: Howard Wolowitz."
"5","Voice: Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission."
"5","Howard: Yes, yes, I’ve been doing my push-ups. I’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me."
"5","Roeger: That’s great, uh, but that’s not why I called. We’ve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission’s been scrubbed."
"5","Howard (Picks up receiver): You’re kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I’m really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too. (Puts down phone.) Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I’m not gonna die in space! I’m gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami."
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Scene: A suit shop."
"5","Sheldon (off): I’m going to need a larger shirt. This one’s a little tight under the arms."
"5","Assistant: Okay."
"5","Leonard: Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?"
"5","Sheldon: Yes, of course that’s why it’s tight."
"5","Leonard: All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?"
"5","Sheldon: You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?"
"5","Leonard: No, it should be: why are you?"
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?"
"5","Assistant: Why don’t you slip this on?"
"5","Sheldon: Said the hangman offering a noose."
"5","Raj: Well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there."
"5","Howard: Well, that’s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space."
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going."
"5","Howard: Why?"
"5","Leonard: Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians."
"5","Howard: Yeah, so?"
"5","Leonard: When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?"
"5","Howard: Well, their technology isn’t that bad."
"5","Raj: When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle."
"5","Howard: All right, well, whatever. I wasn’t worried."
"5","Raj: You weren’t?"
"5","Howard: Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it."
"5","Raj: Oh, please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."
"5","Howard: Make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did."
"5","Sheldon: Ah, much better."
"5","Leonard: You must be burning up."
"5","Sheldon: A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!"
"5","Assistant: Uh, where’s he going?"
"5","Leonard: He keeps emergency Purell in the car."
"5","Sheldon: Keys! Keys! Keys!"
"5","Scene: Penny’s door."
"5","Penny: Hey, you."
"5","Leonard: Before I come in, you should know, I have gas. (Holds up gas canister)"
"5","Penny: For the record, not your worst opening line."
"5","Leonard: Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in."
"5","Penny: B-Before I do it, if you’re a cop you have tell me, right?"
"5","Leonard: Just try it."
"5","Penny: Okay. (In weirdly low voice) What’s it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is so freaky!"
"5","Leonard (in low voice): You’re a mean one Mr. Grinch."
"5","Penny: Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? (Low voice) Leonard, I am your father."
"5","Leonard: I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life."
"5","Penny: Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?"
"5","Leonard: Mm-hmm."
"5","Penny: Well, I’ve been thinking, and maybe I’m ready to take things a little faster."
"5","Leonard: Oh, great."
"5","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"5","Leonard: And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get."
"5","Penny: You know, just-just one thing. Look, we’re in a really great place right now, and I don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again."
"5","Leonard: So we won’t let it get weird."
"5","Penny: Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing."
"5","Leonard: What about (inhales gas, in low voice) Cookies!"
"5","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"5","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?"
"5","Amy: Seven o’clock, right on time."
"5","Sheldon: It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes."
"5","Amy: Well, dinner’s almost ready."
"5","Sheldon: I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that’s a hot date."
"5","Amy: Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight."
"5","Sheldon: What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?"
"5","Amy: With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?"
"5","Amy: I had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why I’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away."
"5","Amy: I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame."
"5","Sheldon: And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school."
"5","Amy: Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me."
"5","Sheldon: Well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock."
"5","Amy: We’ll see. Let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
"5","Sheldon: Super Mario Bros. theme?"
"5","Amy: Yes."
"5","Sheldon: I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work."
"5","Amy: Fine. There’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. Why don’t you have a seat."
"5","Sheldon: Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink."
"5","Amy: May I offer you something to drink?"
"5","Sheldon: You know I don’t drink."
"5","Amy: Not even strawberry Quik?"
"5","Sheldon: I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol."
"5","Amy: Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner."
"5","Sheldon: Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!"
"5","Amy: Just like your mommy used to make."
"5","Sheldon: Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh."
"5","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!"
"5","Penny: Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time."
"5","Penny: Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that."
"5","Leonard: It was the heat of the moment."
"5","Penny: No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?"
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance."
"5","Penny: Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?"
"5","Leonard: Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back."
"5","Penny: You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?"
"5","Leonard: Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?"
"5","Penny: You’re kidding."
"5","Leonard: No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny."
"5","Penny: It’s not funny."
"5","Leonard: Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go."
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"5","Howard: Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?"
"5","Bernadette: You’re kidding."
"5","Howard: No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, you’re in a good mood."
"5","Howard: Yeah, well, why wouldn’t I be? You know, I’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon. (Phone rings) Oh, hang on. Oh, it’s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What’s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that’s great news. Great, great news. All right, I’ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon."
"5","Bernadette: What’s so great?"
"5","Howard: It looks like I’m going into space after all."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, Howie, that’s wonderful!"
"5","Howard: Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay."
"5","Bernadette: What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission."
"5","Howard: Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch."
"5","Bernadette: When?"
"5","Howard: A week from Friday."
"5","Bernadette: What? We’re getting married that Sunday."
"5","Howard: You’re right. I, I can’t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. I’ll call him back."
"5","Bernadette: Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands in your way."
"5","Howard: Well, too bad, you already did. It’s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you."
"5","Bernadette: No. That’s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We’ll have the wedding when you get back."
"5","Howard: But what about all the plans and the guests?"
"5","Bernadette: We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits."
"5","Howard: You’re right, he is! Your dad’s gonna be furious. There’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried."
"5","Bernadette: I’ll talk to him. He won’t say no to his little girl."
"5","Howard: No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man."
"5","Bernadette: But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna make you cancel your space flight."
"5","Howard: We can only hope… that he doesn’t."
"5","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are playing three dimensional chess."
"5","Sheldon: Bishop to queen four, level two. Check."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?"
"5","Sheldon: I’m fine."
"5","Leonard: Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?"
"5","Sheldon: Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?"
"5","Leonard: We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?"
"5","Sheldon: No, I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares."
"5","Leonard: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny."
"5","Sheldon: Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies."
"5","Leonard: I guess we are. So, what’s going on?"
"5","Sheldon: Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy."
"5","Leonard: I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you."
"5","Sheldon: It’s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception."
"5","Leonard: Shame on her."
"5","Sheldon: They let me blow the whistle, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: She’s good."
"5","Sheldon: I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times."
"5","Leonard: You mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
"5","Sheldon: No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?"
"5","Leonard: Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer."
"5","Sheldon: I assume we’re talking about you now?"
"5","Leonard: Yeah."
"5","Sheldon: So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?"
"5","Leonard: Pretty much."
"5","Sheldon: Well, no wonder the women are winning."
"5","Scene: Bernadette’s father’s house."
"5","Howard: Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?"
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: I’m just looking at some old pictures. Come on in."
"5","Howard: Family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it’s a trick question."
"5","Howard: I’m not sure."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Nah, you’ll never get it. It’s a fraction."
"5","Howard: How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Walnut?"
"5","Howard: No, thank you. I’m allergic."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He’s dead now."
"5","Howard: From nuts?"
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way."
"5","Howard: Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Yeah, so?"
"5","Howard: So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you’re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Where are you going?"
"5","Howard: I’m sorry. May I be excused?"
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you… You just gonna stand there?"
"5","Howard: I’m sorry, I didn’t know, is this going to… Well, I should sit… May I be seat… Well, I’ll just sit."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: When I first met you, I didn’t like you."
"5","Howard: I’m aware of that, sir."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: But then you and I had some time together."
"5","Howard: Uh-huh."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: It did not get better."
"5","Howard: Right, right."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl."
"5","Howard: Oh, I am. And just so you know, I’d still be an astronaut, even if I didn’t go to space. I’ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: No, no, you got to go. You can’t turn down an opportunity like this."
"5","Howard: But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?"
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud."
"5","Howard: Um, okay."
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: You got a problem with that?"
"5","Howard: All right, look, I’m gonna level with you. I’m terrified about going into space. What if I don’t make it back?"
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: It’s gonna be okay, son."
"5","Howard: You really think so?"
"5","Mr. Rostenkowski: Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she’ll find a new guy."
"5","Scene: The stairwell."
"5","Penny: Hey."
"5","Leonard: Hey. Off to work?"
"5","Penny: Yeah."
"5","Leonard: Have a nice night."
"5","Penny: Okay, you, too."
"5","Leonard: Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night."
"5","Penny: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it, too."
"5","Leonard: I noticed you never answered me."
"5","Penny: You’re right. (Kisses him) No."
"5","Leonard: Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?"
"5","Penny: Yep."
"5","Leonard: Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?"
"5","Leonard: I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?"
"5","Penny: No!"
"5","Leonard: I played that pretty well. (Enters apartment. Amy, dressed as a Vulcan starfleet officer, is examining Sheldon.)"
"5","Amy: Hello, Leonard."
"5","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"5","Amy: We’re playing doctor. Star Trek style."
"5","Sheldon: I’m in hell, Leonard. Don’t stop."

"5","Following a “Previously on The Big Bang Theory” section"
"5","Scene: A Soyuz Spaceship capsule."
"5","Mission Control (in Russian): Launch step twelve reading okay."
"5","Cosmonaut (in Russian): Launch step twelve acknowledged."
"5","Howard: Hey Mike?"
"5","Mike Massimino: Yeah."
"5","Howard: I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this."
"5","Mike: Good one."
"5","Howard: Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch."
"5","Scene: The apartment."
"5","Leonard: Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?"
"5","Sheldon: 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290."
"5","Amy: I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?"
"5","Sheldon: Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity."
"5","Amy: The uterus quivers, does it not?"
"5","Leonard: There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can watch."
"5","Raj: You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants."
"5","Sheldon: Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides."
"5","Bernadette: Give me those damn Pringles."
"5","Scene: Soyuz capsule."
"5","Cosmonaut (in Russian): Are all of the systems of the ship ready?"
"5","Mission Control: Da."
"5","Mike: Okay, we’re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?"
"5","Howard: Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?"
"5","Credits sequence."
"5","Mike: Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?"
"5","Howard: Check."
"5","Cosmonaut: He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?"
"5","Howard: No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops."
"5","Cosmonaut: Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that."
"5","Mike: Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl."
"5","Cosmonaut: Congratulations."
"5","Howard: Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch."
"5","Cosmonaut: You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?"
"5","Howard: Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again."
"5","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"5","Howard: Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special."
"5","Bernadette: Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again."
"5","Howard: No, here."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me."
"5","Howard: Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, my God."
"5","Howard: Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything."
"5","Bernadette: This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten."
"5","Howard: Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): ‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?"
"5","Howard: No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!"
"5","Bernadette: Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married."
"5","Howard: What?"
"5","Bernadette: I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket."
"5","Howard: But I’m leaving in two days."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): What about Apple Jacks?"
"5","Howard: I don’t need to take cereal."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of breakfast do you think they’re going to give you in Russia?"
"5","Howard: They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn’t mean they hand them out to you when you go."
"5","Bernadette: We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back."
"5","Howard: Wow. Okay. Let’s get married."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): You know what, I’ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space."
"5","Bernadette: So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back."
"5","Leonard: That’s so great. (Others also make encouraging sounds)"
"5","Howard: I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us."
"5","Amy: No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight."
"5","Bernadette: That wasn’t going to be our processional music."
"5","Amy: Well, it was going to be mine."
"5","Sheldon: Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy."
"5","Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun."
"5","Sheldon: That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong."
"5","Bernadette: So, what do you say, Amy?"
"5","Amy: Can I wear my maid of honour dress?"
"5","Bernadette: Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?"
"5","Amy: It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?"
"5","Scene: City Hall."
"5","Penny: Amy, you look great."
"5","Amy: I know."
"5","Leonard: Where’d you get a beer?"
"5","Raj: From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. Shh, no one can know."
"5","Amy: Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?"
"5","Sheldon: It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?"
"5","Howard: You proposed to Penny?"
"5","Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it."
"5","Raj: Where did he pop the question? What did you say?"
"5","Leonard: She said no, can we drop it now?"
"5","Penny: It wasn’t a real proposal."
"5","Bernadette: Why wasn’t it a real proposal?"
"5","Sheldon: He asked her during coitus."
"5","Howard: Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?"
"5","Bernadette: Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day."
"5","Howard: I’m sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You’re ma Bernadette."
"5","Penny: Good move telling Sheldon."
"5","Leonard: What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?"
"5","Amy: All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me."
"5","Registrar: Folks, can I have your attention. It’s five o’clock, we’re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, no."
"5","Howard: I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station."
"5","Registrar: Yeah, me, too. I’ll see you there."
"5","Bernadette: I can’t believe we’re not going to get married."
"5","Amy: Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour."
"5","Cosmonaut: So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don’t get a dog, I’m not walking it, I’m not feeding it, I’m not picking up after it."
"5","Mike: You know you’re going to wind up walking it."
"5","Cosmonaut: I know."
"5","Howard: Uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?"
"5","Mike: Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff."
"5","Dimitri: Okay, I’m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap."
"5","Mike: Is that better?"
"5","Howard: Thanks."
"5","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory bar."
"5","Howard: You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married."
"5","Bernadette: No, isn’t that kind of tacky?"
"5","Penny: Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas."
"5","Bernadette: Are any of them still married?"
"5","Penny: Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…"
"5","Bernadette: There’s got to be some place special we could do it."
"5","Sheldon: Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?"
"5","Leonard: Will you shut up?"
"5","Raj: Well, I know how to make it special."
"5","Howard: I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music."
"5","Raj: Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space."
"5","All: Oh!"
"5","Leonard: That’s so cool."
"5","Howard: Oh, wait to go, Raj."
"5","Raj: I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip."
"5","Howard: Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us."
"5","Leonard: How about our roof?"
"5","Bernadette: Oh, I like that."
"5","Howard: That’s great."
"5","Amy: Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth."
"5","Howard: So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony."
"5","Penny: Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want."
"5","Bernadette: Great, well, who’s it going to be?"
"5","Sheldon: I’ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon."
"5","Bernadette: No."
"5","Sheldon: What do you see in her?"
"5","Dimitri (in Russian): Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?"
"5","Howard: Leaking? What’s leaking?"
"5","Dimitri: Fuel. Shh."
"5","Mission Control (in Russian): Not bad. We feel okay to go."
"5","Dimitri (in Russian): Okay, thanks Mission Control."
"5","Howard: There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?"
"5","Mike: Don’t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops."
"5","Dimitri: This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem."
"5","Howard: What happens on the tenth time?"
"5","Dimitri: Problem."
"5","Howard: Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present."
"5","Raj: Oh, thanks, man."
"5","Sheldon: You didn’t have to do that."
"5","Howard: Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married."
"5","Leonard: Oh, wow."
"5","Sheldon: Oh, dear. I was afraid of this."
"5","Sheldon: While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars."
"5","Howard: Yeah, so?"
"5","Sheldon: I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man."
"5","Leonard: I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man."
"5","Sheldon: Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving."
"5","Scene: Penny’s door. Howard knocks."
"5","Amy: Who is it?"
"5","Howard: It’s the groom."
"5","Amy: Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride."
"5","Howard: Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I’ll be right back."
"5","Bernadette (off): Why can’t she drive herself?"
"5","Howard: She doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van."
"5","Bernadette (off): All right, just hurry!"
"5","Howard: Okay, I’ll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that."
"5","Scene: The roof."
"5","Leonard: Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start."
"5","Raj: What, we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready."
"5","Howard: Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?"
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m fine where I am. I don’t want to fall off the roof."
"5","Howard: You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it."
"5","Raj: Penny. (She starts music playing)"
"5","Mr Rostenkowski: Your new mother-in-law’s a piece of work."
"5","Bernadette: Not now, Dad."
"5","Mr Rostenkowski: She’s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go."
"5","Bernadette: Here you go? What am I, a football?"
"5","Mr Rostenkowski: Like that guy could catch a football."
"5","Raj: Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Louder!"
"5","Bernadette: They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer."
"5","Raj: Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I’m going to need a minute."
"5","Penny: Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other."
"5","Leonard: Hmm."
"5","Penny: Problem?"
"5","Leonard: No."
"5","Sheldon: I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom."
"5","Penny: Oh, grow up."
"5","Leonard: Hey, I didn’t say it."
"5","Amy: All right, that’s enough from the both of you."
"5","Penny: Well, he started it."
"5","Amy: Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out."
"5","Leonard: Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days."
"5","Sheldon: Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu’ taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH."
"5","Bernadette: Sheldon! I told you no Klingon."
"5","Sheldon: Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry."
"5","Raj: I believe you two have prepared vows?"
"5","Bernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever."
"5","Howard: Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski."
"5","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Speak up!"
"5","Howard: Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you."
"5","All: By the power vested in us, by the state of California…"
"5","Sheldon: And the Klingon High Council…"
"5","All: We now pronounce you husband and wife."
"5","Mike: That’s ignition. I love this part."
"5","Dimitri: Me, too."
"5","Howard: I have strongly mixed feelings."
"5","Bernadette: Oh, my God, it’s happening."
"5","Penny: Did I miss it?"
"5","Leonard: No, come on in. Hurry."
"5","Bernadette: I love that man."
"5","Raj: Me, too."
"5","Penny: I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying."
"5","Leonard: This is it."
"5","Sheldon: Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz."
