"8","Series 08 Episode 01 – The Locomotion Interruption"
"8","Following a “previously on” sequence."
"8","Scene: A railway station. Sheldon is wearing no trousers."
"8","Sheldon: Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?"
"8","Man: I don’t think so."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?"
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Leonard: Morning."
"8","Penny: Hi. Want to do yoga with me?"
"8","Leonard: Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that. (Phone rings) Hello?"
"8","(Phone rings)"
"8","Sheldon: Hello, Leonard."
"8","Leonard: Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice."
"8","Sheldon: Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up."
"8","Leonard: I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything."
"8","Leonard: Oh, my God, are you okay?"
"8","Sheldon: No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs."
"8","Leonard: Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?"
"8","Penny: Hey, what’s going on?"
"8","Leonard: He got all of his stuff stolen."
"8","Penny: Oh."
"8"," "
"8","Sheldon: 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,"
"8","Leonard: Okay."
"8","Sheldon: Hurry."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence."
"8","Leonard: I’ll be there as soon as I can."
"8","Penny: Is he okay?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled."
"8","Leonard: Feel like driving to Arizona with me?"
"8","Penny: I can’t, I have that job interview."
"8","Leonard: Oh, right."
"8","Penny: Besides, I don’t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath until your hair grows back."
"8","Leonard: All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?"
"8","Penny: Nope."
"8","Leonard: Come on, you didn’t even try."
"8","Scene: Howard’s car."
"8","Raj: Thanks for the lift."
"8","Howard: What’s wrong with your car?"
"8","Raj: I’m having my windows untinted."
"8","Howard: Why?"
"8","Raj: Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know."
"8","Howard: What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention to you."
"8","Raj: Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the way to work."
"8","Howard: I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay."
"8","Raj: I thought Stuart was looking after her."
"8","Howard: He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird."
"8","Raj: How so?"
"8","Howard: I don’t know, they’re, chummy."
"8","Raj: Like us?"
"8","Howard: No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog."
"8","Raj: She feeds him out of her own mouth?"
"8","Howard: I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out."
"8","Raj: So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?"
"8","Howard: First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life."
"8","Raj: Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active…"
"8","Howard: I said well past it."
"8","Scene: Kingman Police Station."
"8","Sheldon: Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?"
"8","Hernandez: Not yet."
"8","Sheldon: Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?"
"8","Hernandez: Nope."
"8","Sheldon: Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"8","Leonard: Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself."
"8","Amy: My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, time’s gonna fly by."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Penny: I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really nervous."
"8","Bernadette: Don’t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things."
"8","Penny: I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé."
"8","Bernadette: This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding."
"8","Penny: They do?"
"8","Bernadette: Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you."
"8","Penny: Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head."
"8","Bernadette: You’ll be fine. Just be yourself."
"8","Penny: I wish I felt more confident."
"8","Bernadette: Penny, I wouldn’t have put you up for this job if I didn’t think you could handle it."
"8","Penny: Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel."
"8","Bernadette: It’s too late to cancel. You’re going."
"8","Penny: But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?"
"8","Penny: They’re comfortable."
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"8","Howard: Ma, I hope you’re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be."
"8","Stuart: Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?"
"8","Howard: Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out."
"8","Stuart: Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn’t have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious."
"8","Howard: It’s not that precious."
"8","Raj: I’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious."
"8","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, I can’t find my glasses."
"8","(off)"
"8","Stuart: Be right there, Deb Deb. They’re probably on her head."
"8","Howard: Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about."
"8","Stuart: Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you’d know."
"8","Raj: It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone."
"8","Sheldon: Any word on my stolen items?"
"8","Hernandez: We’re doing everything we can."
"8","Sheldon: You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard. Oh, I’m so happy to see you."
"8","Amy: Are you okay?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?"
"8","Amy: What do you mean, why did I come? You’re my boyfriend. I haven’t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?"
"8","Sheldon: I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers."
"8","Amy: Fine. Whisper it."
"8","Sheldon (whispers): Shotgun."
"8","(whispers)"
"8","Leonard: So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?"
"8","Sheldon: Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle."
"8","Leonard: How were they?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station."
"8","Leonard: Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?"
"8","Sheldon: Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are."
"8","Leonard: I’m sorry, so you never went outside?"
"8","Sheldon: Or had a single piece of fruit."
"8","Scene: Pharmaceutical Company Office."
"8","Dan: So, why do you think you’d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?"
"8","Penny: Well, I’m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I’m saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I’m done."
"8","Dan: You sure?"
"8","Penny: People. Yes."
"8","Dan: Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?"
"8","Penny: Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump."
"8","Dan: Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump."
"8","Penny: People."
"8","Howard: It’s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother."
"8","Raj: That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45."
"8","Howard: Come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?"
"8","Raj: I don’t know. I mean, she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They’re both adults."
"8","Howard: Who cares? You wouldn’t care if I slept with your mom?"
"8","Raj: You know what? You’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing."
"8","Howard: This is stupid. I’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her."
"8","Raj: ‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do."
"8","Stuart (voice on answerphone): This is Debbie."
"8","(voice on answerphone)"
"8","Mrs Wolowitz (voice on answerphone): And this is Stuart."
"8","Together: Just kidding."
"8","Stuart (voice on answerphone): Leave a message."
"8","Raj: This is the part where you talk."
"8","Dan: All right, let’s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor’s drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?"
"8","Penny: Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I’m really sorry for wasting your time."
"8","Dan: Don’t worry about it. Thanks for stopping by."
"8","Penny: Okay, thanks. Um, I’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a, a little terrified of her."
"8","Dan: Wait, wait. You’re scared of Bernadette?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, kind of."
"8","Dan: I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she’s so nice with that squeaky little voice."
"8","Penny: I know, but she’s kind of a bully."
"8","Dan: Wll, she is. I didn’t even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her."
"8","Penny: Me, too."
"8","Dan: Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing."
"8","Penny: What happened?"
"8","Dan: I couldn’t do it. She’s still working on it. Oh, we’re not gonna tell her about this, right?"
"8","Penny: Oh, my God, no."
"8","Sheldon: At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t care."
"8","Sheldon: Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?"
"8","Amy: Have you not noticed that I’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?"
"8","Sheldon: I just thought you were bad at the game."
"8","Amy: I’m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?"
"8","Sheldon: Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?"
"8","Amy: We’re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own."
"8","Leonard: What’s the big deal?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on."
"8","Leonard: Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me."
"8","Amy: Can I stop now?"
"8","Leonard: Just tell her."
"8","Sheldon: I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me."
"8","Amy: You were worried about that?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect."
"8","Sheldon: Can I have one more moment with Leonard?"
"8","Amy: Sure."
"8","Sheldon: Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her."
"8","Howard: Now, I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of excited to see Sheldon."
"8","Bernadette: I never thought I’d say this, but Penny got a job today."
"8","Howard: She did?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me."
"8","Howard (answering a knock on the door): What do you want?"
"8","(answering a knock on the door)"
"8","Stuart: I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom’s."
"8","Howard: You’re right, I’m not. I think it’s weird."
"8","Bernadette: Howie?"
"8","Howard: It is. He’s a grown man. He’s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?"
"8","Stuart: Hey, you’re not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking…"
"8","Howard: Your mother and I? You’re not my father."
"8","Stuart: I didn’t say I was your father."
"8","Howard: Well, I didn’t say I was your father."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, calm down. You’re not his father, he’s not your father. Nobody’s anybody’s father."
"8","Stuart: I, I’m sorry you don’t like my life choices, but it’s my life."
"8","Howard: Well, it’s my house, it’s my rules."
"8","Stuart: Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?"
"8","Bernadette: Hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him."
"8","Stuart: I don’t have to listen to you."
"8","Howard: Don’t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife."
"8","Stuart: You know what? This isn’t getting us anywhere. When you’re ready to apologize, you know where to find me."
"8","Howard: Yeah, in my house."
"8","Stuart: That’s right, sucka."
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Sheldon: I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left."
"8","Amy: But you still accomplished something."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?"
"8","Sheldon: That I couldn’t do it?"
"8","Leonard: Exactly. Right after they said yeah."
"8","Amy: But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way? That’s what makes it an adventure."
"8","Sheldon: That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks."
"8","Amy: See? This trip was good for you."
"8","Sheldon: Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly."
"8","Leonard: Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way."
"8","All: Hey."
"8","Penny: Hey, look who’s back."
"8","Sheldon: Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out."
"8","Sheldon: Would you like to see pictures from my trip?"
"8","Penny: I thought your phone got stolen."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud."
"8","Leonard: And you thought they all had a silver lining."
"8","Sheldon: Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom."
"8","Penny: I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station."
"8","Sheldon: I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave out."
"8","Series 08 Episode 02 – The Junior Professor Solution"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas."
"8","Howard: What a sick use of science."
"8","Raj: Hey, as long as the baby’s healthy."
"8","Amy: I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals."
"8","Leonard: Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass."
"8","Howard: Yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked."
"8","Raj: But half-man, half-owl could fly…"
"8","Sheldon: The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on."
"8","Howard: So, Penny, when’s the new job start?"
"8","Penny: Next Monday."
"8","Bernadette: Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?"
"8","Penny: Uh, not yet, but I will."
"8","Bernadette: Great. When?"
"8","Penny: I said I’ll get to it."
"8","Sheldon: I’m sensing awkwardness, am I right?"
"8","Amy: Yes."
"8","Sheldon: Swish."
"8","Bernadette: I don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start."
"8","Penny: Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They’ll tell me everything I need to know."
"8","Bernadette: But imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material."
"8","Penny: Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?"
"8","Bernadette: Couldn’t hurt."
"8","Leonard: Mm, I don’t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?"
"8","Sheldon: It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz."
"8","Scene: Mrs Davis’ office."
"8","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs. Davis. (Knock, knock, knock) Guess who?"
"8","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"8","Mrs Davis: Dr. Cooper."
"8","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) That’s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?"
"8","Mrs Davis: Yes. Uh, welcome back."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?"
"8","Mrs Davis: You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no."
"8","Sheldon: That’s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?"
"8","Mrs Davis: Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study."
"8","Sheldon: Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?"
"8","Mrs Davis: Currently, you’re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you’ll be able to choose whatever field of research you’d like."
"8","Sheldon: But if I’m a professor, then I’ll have to teach a class."
"8","Mrs Davis: That is correct."
"8","Sheldon: So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?"
"8","Mrs Davis: Yes."
"8","Sheldon: You people are sick."
"8","Scene: Amy’s lab."
"8","Penny: Hey. Ready to go to lunch?"
"8","Amy: Just give me a minute. I’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off."
"8","Penny: What happens if you don’t?"
"8","Amy: Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?"
"8","Penny: Uh, no. Actually, I didn’t invite her."
"8","Amy: How come?"
"8","Penny: Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me."
"8","Amy: Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress."
"8","Penny: That is not true."
"8","Amy: I’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago."
"8","Penny: I told you, they’ll be right out."
"8","Amy: Okay, so no Bernadette."
"8","Penny: Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?"
"8","Amy: No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face."
"8","Penny: I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her."
"8","Amy: I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends."
"8","Penny: So, what are you saying?"
"8","Amy: I’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?"
"8","Scene: The cafeteria."
"8","Raj: So, I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?"
"8","Howard: Why is it your last name and her first name?"
"8","Raj: Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney."
"8","Leonard: Hey, how’d it go with human resources?"
"8","Sheldon: Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class."
"8","Raj: I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?"
"8","Sheldon: What a stupid question."
"8","Leonard: The kids are gonna love him."
"8","Sheldon: I can’t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers."
"8","Leonard: This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong."
"8","Sheldon: Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn’t mean I always do."
"8","Raj: You enjoy giving people grades."
"8","Sheldon: A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus."
"8","Howard: And you love the sound of your own voice."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It’s like an earful of melted caramel."
"8","Leonard: Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter."
"8","Sheldon: It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That’s rich. I’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm."
"8","Amy: Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don’t you? That’s right, say my name."
"8","Bernadette (on skype): Hey."
"8","(on skype)"
"8","Amy: Hey, what’s going on?"
"8","Bernadette: Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?"
"8","Amy: No Penny?"
"8","Bernadette: Not tonight. I’m a little frustrated with her."
"8","Amy: Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?"
"8","Bernadette: So it’s not just me. You see it, too."
"8","Amy: I do, I see it."
"8","Bernadette: It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure."
"8","Amy: That’s outrageous."
"8","Bernadette: I know."
"8","Amy: If she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you."
"8","Bernadette: Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?"
"8","Amy: I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party."
"8","Scene: Sheldon’s classroom."
"8","Leonard: Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?"
"8","Sheldon: There is no class."
"8","Howard: Did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?"
"8","Sheldon: No one signed up."
"8","Leonard: Well, that’s not your fault."
"8","Sheldon: I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious."
"8","Leonard: What?"
"8","Raj: Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry."
"8","Sheldon: No, it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter."
"8","Raj: Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away."
"8","Howard: Hey, what if I took your class?"
"8","Sheldon: Why would you do that?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, why would you do that?"
"8","Raj: What’s wrong with you?"
"8","Howard: I’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about."
"8","Raj: Ask why not again, I’ve got an answer."
"8","Howard: Sheldon, I’m more than smart enough to take your class."
"8","Sheldon: No."
"8","Howard: Yes."
"8","Sheldon: How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?"
"8","Howard: I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution."
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?"
"8","Howard: I’d use Feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?"
"8","Howard: Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I’ll say that. Now do you think I’m smart enough?"
"8","Howard: Oh, come on. You might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists."
"8","Sheldon: You take that back."
"8","Howard: No."
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Amy: So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I’m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette."
"8","Sheldon: I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?"
"8","Amy: Because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I’m in the centre now, and I love that even more."
"8","Sheldon: Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine."
"8","Amy: But I’m just…"
"8","Sheldon: Not now."
"8","Amy: You better watch that attitude, buddy. You’re dating the popular girl now."
"8","Leonard: Hmm. You’re up late."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I’m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don’t really understand it."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, why are you doing this?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m a teacher, Leonard. It’s my job."
"8","Leonard: No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure."
"8","Leonard: You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it."
"8","Sheldon: Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority."
"8","Leonard: Might be something to think about."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah."
"8","Sheldon: Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?"
"8","Howard: Hey."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin."
"8","Howard: Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I’m out. But if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I’m willing to give this a shot."
"8","Sheldon: I suppose that’s a fair request. There’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience."
"8","Howard: Okay."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?"
"8","Howard: I am."
"8","Sheldon: Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?"
"8","Howard: It’s an inverted cycloid."
"8","Sheldon: Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?"
"8","Howard: That’s where I’m a little fuzzy."
"8","Sheldon: Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a C."
"8","Howard (singing): All I do is win, win, win no matter what."
"8","(singing)"
"8","Sheldon: What are you doing?"
"8","Howard (singing): Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!"
"8","Howard: If you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I’m gonna be a crappy student. (Singing) Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause I never been defeated and I won’t stop now…"
"8","(Singing)"
"8","Sheldon: Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand."
"8","Sheldon: Now, where was I? Let’s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?"
"8","Howard: Making a straw."
"8","Sheldon: Why?"
"8","Howard: So I can shoot you with a spitball."
"8","Sheldon: You’re not going to do that, and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!"
"8","Howard: Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don’t think I can do that again."
"8","Amy (on phone): Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?"
"8","(on phone)"
"8","Penny: What?"
"8","Amy: Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs."
"8","Penny: Uh, thanks, but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me."
"8","Amy: Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?"
"8","Penny: No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So…"
"8","Amy: Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend."
"8","Bernadette: Hey, Amy."
"8","Amy: Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine."
"8","Bernadette: That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I’d come by and help her study."
"8","Amy: Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She’s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?"
"8","Bernadette: I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we’re good."
"8","Amy: Oh. Great. I’m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position."
"8","Bernadette: Well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal."
"8","Amy: You mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend."
"8","Sheldon: Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die."
"8","Sheldon: Well?"
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD."
"8","Sheldon: Are you sure? It just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to."
"8","Howard: You reported me to human resources?"
"8","Sheldon: You violated the sanctity of my mouth."
"8","Howard: Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you’re happy."
"8","Sheldon: I told you you weren’t smart enough to take it."
"8","Howard: I’m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. I could do the same to you."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, try me."
"8","Howard: Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?"
"8","Sheldon: Young’s modulus."
"8","Raj: Is that right?"
"8","Howard: Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?"
"8","Sheldon: Laminate the core material."
"8","Leonard: Come on, give him a hard one."
"8","Howard: That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don’t know, do you? What’s the matter, smart guy? Don’t know Poiseuille’s law?"
"8","Sheldon (coughing several times): Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool."
"8","(coughing several times)"
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?"
"8","Penny: Headaches, dizziness and nausea."
"8","Bernadette: Yes."
"8","Penny: Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you."
"8","Bernadette: Want to stop here?"
"8","Penny: Uh, no. I can keep going."
"8","Bernadette: Nah, you got this. Let’s go for a drink. I’ll call Amy."
"8","Penny: Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight."
"8","Amy (phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny’s door): Hey, girl."
"8","(phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny’s door)"
"8","Leonard: Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea"
"8","Raj: 250 million years."
"8","Leonard: Yes. (Cheers)"
"8","(Cheers)"
"8","Howard: Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg."
"8","Sheldon: Oh! It’s not even Easter time. This is crazy."
"8","Howard: Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?"
"8","All together: The Rhombicosidodecahedron. (Cheers)"
"8","Leonard: We are so smart."
"8","Raj: Why didn’t girls like us in high school?"
"8","Howard: Because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!"
"8","Leonard: Right again. (Cheers)"
"8","Series 08 Episode 03 – The First Pitch Insufficiency"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Howard: So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate."
"8","Howard: All right."
"8","Raj: You suck, Wolowitz."
"8","Howard: What’s that about?"
"8","Raj: I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball."
"8","Sheldon: He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck."
"8","Penny: Hi. What’s going on?"
"8","Leonard: Baseball."
"8","Penny: Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play."
"8","Leonard: He’s practicing."
"8","Penny: For what?"
"8","Howard: The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?"
"8","Penny: What, you? Really?"
"8","Howard: Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me."
"8","Penny: That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group."
"8","Sheldon: Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team."
"8","Penny: I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget."
"8","Leonard: C’mon now, throw one."
"8","Howard: All right, here we go."
"8","Raj: You look like a jackass."
"8","Howard: Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings."
"8","Leonard: Now you know why we’re not outside."
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Sheldon: Did you enjoy my lecture?"
"8","Amy: No, and neither did our waiter."
"8","Sheldon: Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it."
"8","Amy: It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail."
"8","Penny: Hey, how was dinner?"
"8","Sheldon: Good, I had Cornish game hen."
"8","Leonard: Oh, that poor waiter."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?"
"8","Penny: You guys are going out two nights in a row?"
"8","Sheldon: I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement."
"8","Penny: That’s so hot."
"8","Amy: It’s better than hot, it’s binding."
"8","Sheldon: If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date."
"8","Penny: Aw."
"8","Amy: You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates."
"8","Sheldon: Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Bernadette: I can’t believe you’re sore."
"8","Howard: Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game."
"8","Bernadette: But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV."
"8","Howard: For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five."
"8","Bernadette: I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people."
"8","Howard: They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn’t say no."
"8","Bernadette: Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up."
"8","Howard: Thank you, that would be great."
"8","Bernadette: Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound."
"8","Howard: What’s wrong with the way I run?"
"8","Bernadette; Oh, just kidding. Nothing."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Penny: Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub."
"8","Sheldon: At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon."
"8","Amy: I then suggested a pub."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding."
"8","Leonard: You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding."
"8","Sheldon: No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum."
"8","Amy: After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin."
"8","Leonard: Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive."
"8","Sheldon: Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours."
"8","Penny: Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?"
"8","Sheldon: I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours."
"8","Leonard: You don’t honestly think that, do you?"
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you."
"8","Leonard: There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it."
"8","Penny: Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc."
"8","Leonard: That’s the part you have a problem with?"
"8","Penny: Relax."
"8","Amy: There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc."
"8","Scene: A gymnasium."
"8","Raj: So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?"
"8","Howard: Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out."
"8","Bernadette: All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate."
"8","Howard: Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?"
"8","Bernadette: Keep going."
"8","Howard: How about now?"
"8","Bernadette: I’ll let you know."
"8","Howard: Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?"
"8","Bernadette: Okay, stop."
"8","Howard: Are you kidding me?!"
"8","Bernadette: That’s sixty feet."
"8","Howard: There’s no way this is sixty feet."
"8","Bernadette: I’m looking at it."
"8","Howard: You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is."
"8","Scene: Amy’s car."
"8","Leonard: Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?"
"8","Sheldon: For starters, we enjoy spending time together."
"8","Leonard: So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things."
"8","Sheldon: It’s called parallel play."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, toddlers do that."
"8","Sheldon: Not as well as we do."
"8","Leonard: You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything."
"8","Penny: So what? Why do you even care?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over."
"8","Leonard: Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement."
"8","Sheldon: If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today."
"8","Amy: It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire."
"8","Scene: The gym."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it."
"8","Howard: That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it."
"8","Bernadette: Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working with."
"8","Raj: Come on Howard, fire it in."
"8","Bernadette: Throw the damn ball!"
"8","Scene: The pub."
"8","Amy: So when do you guys plan on getting married?"
"8","Penny: Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant."
"8","Sheldon: May I have one of your fries?"
"8","Amy: Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?"
"8","Sheldon: Absolutely not."
"8","Leonard: Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her."
"8","Sheldon: It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?"
"8","Leonard: I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified."
"8","Sheldon: Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four."
"8","Leonard: How ridiculous is he?"
"8","Penny: A hundred."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion."
"8","Sheldon: No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig."
"8","Penny: Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry."
"8","Sheldon: Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto."
"8","Penny: Oh, what did those rascals do now?"
"8","Amy: They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper."
"8","Leonard: So, this is accurate?"
"8","Sheldon: It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers."
"8","Penny: Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships."
"8","Sheldon: Kind of? It does it perfectly."
"8","Amy: Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten."
"8","Leonard: Fine. We’ll take it right now."
"8","Penny: No, don’t."
"8","Leonard: What?"
"8","Penny: Just don’t take it."
"8","Leonard: Why not?"
"8","Penny: ‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?"
"8","Leonard: Come on. It’ll be fun."
"8","Penny: I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink."
"8","Leonard: Sorry."
"8","Amy: I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work."
"8","Bernadette: Think he’s getting any better?"
"8","Raj: Yup."
"8","Howard: That was a close one."
"8","Bernadette: Okay."
"8","Raj: Is it too late for him to cancel?"
"8","Bernadette: I think so."
"8","Howard: Heads up! Watch out!"
"8","Leonard: Are you mad at me?"
"8","Penny: No, stop being stupid."
"8","Leonard: Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?"
"8","Penny: Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about."
"8","Leonard: What are you worried about?"
"8","Penny: That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, that scares me, too."
"8","Penny: It does?"
"8","Leonard: Sometimes."
"8","Penny: Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on."
"8","Leonard: Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing."
"8","Mike (on Skype): Hey, Froot Loops, what’s up?"
"8","(on Skype)"
"8","Howard: Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?"
"8","Mike: Yeah. Don’t do it. What else you up to?"
"8","Howard: Why shouldn’t I do it?"
"8","Mike: There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever."
"8","Howard: But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?"
"8","Mike: That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose."
"8","Howard: Well, maybe I’ll do a good job."
"8","Mike: I don’t know. In space, you couldn’t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity."
"8","Howard: Okay, thanks for the pep talk."
"8","Mike: Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She’s so much cuter than you, I don’t know how you ever got her."
"8","Bernadette: He’s so nice."
"8","Penny: Hey, sorry about that."
"8","Amy: No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place."
"8","Sheldon: Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge."
"8","Leonard: I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple."
"8","Sheldon: The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag."
"8","Leonard: I killed his Chewbacca slippers."
"8","Penny: Let’s just take the test."
"8","Leonard: No, no, no, I don’t want to."
"8","Penny: Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad."
"8","Leonard: Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two."
"8","Sheldon: Or a one. A one is possible."
"8","Leonard: Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you."
"8","Penny: Leonard."
"8","Amy: It would make me so happy if you said things like that."
"8","Sheldon: We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy."
"8","Scene: Angels Stadium"
"8","Raj: Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together."
"8","Penny: Look at you, talking sports."
"8","Leonard: This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game."
"8","Sheldon: Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, what did you expect?"
"8","Sheldon: I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade."
"8","Amy: I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead."
"8","Sheldon: Who’s the bobblehead of?"
"8","Amy: Does it matter?"
"8","Sheldon: No, as long as it bobbles."
"8","Bernadette: Howie, I am so proud of you."
"8","Howard: Thanks. I’m proud of me, too."
"8","Man: You ready?"
"8","Howard: Let’s do it."
"8","Man: All right."
"8","Howard: Wish me luck."
"8","Bernadette: Go get ’em."
"8","Stadium Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz."
"8","Howard: Thank you. Thank you."
"8","Penny: Can he really throw a ball?"
"8","Leonard: On our Quidditch team, he…"
"8","Penny: Yeah, that’s a no."
"8","Howard: I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch."
"8","Bernadette: Why is it going so slow?"
"8","Howard: ‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch."
"8","Howard: Okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about Mars."
"8","Man in Crowd: You suck, Wolowitz!"
"8","Sheldon: He makes a valid point."
"8","Howard: Okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster."
"8","Series 08 Episode 04 – The Hook-Up Reverbration"
"8","Scene: The cafeteria."
"8","Leonard: Have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I think that sounds wonderful."
"8","Howard: What? You’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens."
"8","Sheldon: Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot."
"8","Raj: Hey, guys."
"8","Howard: Hey."
"8","Sheldon: Hello."
"8","Raj: We still on for tomorrow night?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend."
"8","Sheldon: Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends."
"8","Howard: Since when do you read social science?"
"8","Sheldon: I go to the bathroom like everybody else."
"8","Raj: Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us."
"8","Raj: You guys kiss and hold hands."
"8","Leonard: I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic."
"8","Raj: Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship."
"8","Leonard: What happens if she doesn’t like us?"
"8","Raj: Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Amy: So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?"
"8","Howard: I don’t want to talk about it."
"8","Bernadette: But he’s going to."
"8","Howard: My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven."
"8","Bernadette: Long story short, they have seven HBOs."
"8","Raj: Emily, you know almost everybody here."
"8","Emily: Hi."
"8","Raj: And this is Leonard, this is Penny."
"8","Emily: Oh, it’s so nice to meet you."
"8","Leonard: Nice to finally meet you, too."
"8","Penny: Hi."
"8","Emily: Hello."
"8","Leonard: Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her."
"8","Raj: I told you she exists."
"8","Penny: Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist."
"8","Emily: Uh, yeah, I’m a resident at Huntington Hospital."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop."
"8","Bernadette: You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time."
"8","Penny: Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor."
"8","Emily: Yeah. I’m sure that’d be fine."
"8","Sheldon: I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?"
"8","Emily: Um, okay, I guess."
"8","Amy: I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Bernadette: Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?"
"8","Penny: I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me."
"8","Bernadette: Did she say she didn’t like you?"
"8","Penny: Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face."
"8","Amy: We have led different lives."
"8","Bernadette: You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?"
"8","Penny: It’s just this vibe I got."
"8","Bernadette: I’m sure you’re worried about nothing."
"8","Penny: Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much."
"8","Bernadette: Really?"
"8","Penny: Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out."
"8","Bernadette: When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. It’s fine."
"8","Penny: Yeah, I hope you’re right."
"8","Amy: You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?"
"8","Penny: Yeah."
"8","Amy: I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones."
"8","Scene: Capital Comics."
"8","Sheldon: I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?"
"8","Howard: Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too."
"8","Leonard: Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs."
"8","Howard: Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?"
"8","Raj: You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies."
"8","Leonard: Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?"
"8","Howard: All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?"
"8","Sheldon: For starters, they shed and bite."
"8","Leonard: Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?"
"8","Raj: So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?"
"8","Leonard: It’s kind of a dream come true."
"8","Howard: That does sound fun."
"8","Raj: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place."
"8","Sheldon: I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in."
"8","Leonard: It’s not that bad."
"8","Scene: Emily’s surgery."
"8","Penny: Hey."
"8","Penny: Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it."
"8","Emily: Sure."
"8","Penny: Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that."
"8","Emily: Thanks. If we could get started. I’m a little busy."
"8","Penny: Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra."
"8","Emily: Great."
"8","Penny: So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure."
"8","Emily: All right."
"8","Penny: It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive."
"8","Emily: Funny."
"8","Penny: Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me."
"8","Emily: No, it’s fine."
"8","Penny: Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?"
"8","Emily: Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem."
"8","Penny: Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?"
"8","Emily: Look, it’s nothing. It’s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up."
"8","Penny: What? Oh, why would he say that?"
"8","Emily: Did it not happen?"
"8","Penny: Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up."
"8","Emily: Did you kiss?"
"8","Emily: Were you naked?"
"8","Emily: So, it was a hook-up."
"8","Penny: No. Yeah."
"8","Sheldon: So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?"
"8","Leonard: Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store."
"8","Howard: You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride."
"8","Raj: Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?"
"8","Sheldon: Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?"
"8","Howard: Toy stores, puppet shows."
"8","Leonard: Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes."
"8","Leonard: And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?"
"8","Raj: We are now."
"8","Penny: You told Emily we hooked up?"
"8","Raj: Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody."
"8","Penny: Why would you say that?"
"8","Raj: We were having a conversation about past lovers."
"8","Penny: We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?"
"8","Raj: Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?"
"8","Leonard: Why say it?"
"8","Penny: Yes."
"8","Raj: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list."
"8","Penny: Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh."
"8","Raj: Great."
"8","Sheldon: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next."
"8","Raj: You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next."
"8","Sheldon: No. You’re crazy about me."
"8","Penny: I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past."
"8","Amy: Hmm-hmm."
"8","Penny: Almost everyone has a past."
"8","Bernadette: Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you."
"8","Penny: It’s not."
"8","Bernadette: And I’m sure you can turn it around."
"8","Penny: How? You can’t force someone to like you."
"8","Amy: What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine."
"8","Penny: No, that won’t work."
"8","Amy: You’re right. Cheers."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?"
"8","Penny: What?"
"8","Bernadette: Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute."
"8","Penny: It’s stupid."
"8","Bernadette: Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas."
"8","Amy: I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back."
"8","Penny: Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you."
"8","Amy: Shh. Amy’s here now."
"8","Sheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store."
"8","Howard: We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves."
"8","Sheldon: And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out."
"8","Howard: You say things like that all the time."
"8","Sheldon: Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up."
"8","Leonard: Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?"
"8","Howard: Yeah."
"8","Leonard: Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m sure she did."
"8","Leonard: Why?"
"8","Sheldon: Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list."
"8","Leonard: Will you stay out of this?"
"8","Sheldon: If only Penny had said that once in a while."
"8","Howard: Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she wants to marry."
"8","Leonard: That’s true."
"8","Howard: Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon."
"8","Leonard: Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women."
"8","Sheldon: I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store."
"8","Howard: He’s right."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack."
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Leonard: There’s something I wanted to run past you."
"8","Penny: What’s up?"
"8","Leonard: Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?"
"8","Penny: Why are you asking me?"
"8","Leonard: Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about."
"8","Penny: Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah."
"8","Penny: Huh."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Howard: Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity."
"8","Bernadette: Nope."
"8","Howard: But you didn’t hear what it was."
"8","Bernadette: I know."
"8","Howard: Oh, come on."
"8","Bernadette: Fine. What is it?"
"8","Howard: It’s to help reopen the comic book store."
"8","Howard: Well, hear me out."
"8","Bernadette: Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house."
"8","Howard: I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money."
"8","Bernadette: It just seems like a risky investment."
"8","Howard: I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together."
"8","Bernadette: Oh. Howie, I had no idea."
"8","Howard: Well, I don’t like to talk about it."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?"
"8","Howard: That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me."
"8","Sheldon: I’d like your honest opinion on something."
"8","Amy: Of course."
"8","Sheldon: Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind."
"8","Amy: I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: Perfect. Now, I’m considering investing in Stuart’s comic book store."
"8","Amy: Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?"
"8","Sheldon: No."
"8","Amy: Then I think it’s a terrific idea."
"8","Sheldon: Great. Wait till you hear about our van."
"8","Raj: Hey."
"8","Raj: Thanks for inviting us over."
"8","Penny: Oh, thank you for coming."
"8","Emily: Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office."
"8","Penny: No, no. No need to apologise."
"8","Raj: Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?"
"8","Penny: Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago."
"8","Raj: It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have."
"8","Penny: Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us."
"8","Emily: Mm. I’d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I’d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are."
"8","Penny: Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous."
"8","Raj: It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life."
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"8","Stuart: So, what brings you by?"
"8","Howard: Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house."
"8","Stuart: Technically, it’s your mom’s house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome."
"8","Howard: I’m always welcome."
"8","Stuart: Mm, just try and call first."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, let’s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions."
"8","Stuart: Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money."
"8","Howard: What?"
"8","Stuart: Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala."
"8","Howard: Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more than one bubala."
"8","Stuart: I don’t know who he’s talking to. She’s at Target, buying me shirts."
"8","Raj: I’m so glad we could work this all out."
"8","Penny: Yeah, me, too."
"8","Emily: You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard."
"8","Penny: Oh, we would love that."
"8","Penny: Okay, good night, guys."
"8","Emily: All right, night."
"8","Penny: Bye."
"8","Emily and Penny (simultaneously): I hate her."
"8","(simultaneously)"
"8","Raj: I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store."
"8","Leonard: I know. I was looking forward to it."
"8","Sheldon: It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace."
"8","Howard: With comfy seats."
"8","Raj: And snacks."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I guess it was too good to be true."
"8","Series 08 Episode 05 – The Focus Attenuation"
"8","Scene: The cafeteria."
"8","Raj: Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking."
"8","Leonard: We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?"
"8","Howard: Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back."
"8","Sheldon: I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town."
"8","Leonard: That’s not what happened."
"8","Sheldon: I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death."
"8","Howard: No one wants to hear it."
"8","Sheldon: Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old."
"8","Leonard: Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?"
"8","Raj: Easy. Sleeping with Penny."
"8","Howard: Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him."
"8","Raj: Tricking Penny into getting engaged."
"8","Howard: And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up."
"8","Leonard: I think someone owes me an apology."
"8","Sheldon: Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives."
"8","Howard: You admit Amy’s a distraction?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?"
"8","Leonard: Well, maybe we have lost our focus."
"8","Howard: It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas."
"8","Raj: Ooh, we could have one of those retreats."
"8","LeonardLike our own science retreat."
"8","Howard: My cousin has a cabin out in the woods."
"8","Sheldon: I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?"
"8","Leonard: Then we’ll go to a hotel."
"8","Sheldon: A hotel? Did you see The Shining?"
"8","Raj: We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake."
"8","Sheldon: Did you see The Lake House?"
"8","Raj: Nothing bad happens in The Lake House."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet."
"8","Leonard: Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it."
"8","Sheldon: Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house."
"8","Leonard: You would go to a beach house?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?"
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Penny: Hey."
"8","Leonard: Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday."
"8","Penny: Want to go to Vegas this weekend?"
"8","Amy: Of course I do."
"8","Penny: Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?"
"8","Bernadette: Hell, yeah."
"8","Penny: Yes. I’ll check flights."
"8","Bernadette: I’ll check hotels."
"8","Amy: I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed."
"8","Leonard: They seem okay with it."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Raj: Hey."
"8","Leonard: Hey."
"8","Howard: Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it."
"8","Raj: Why not?"
"8","Howard: Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit."
"8","Raj: For your information, Emily is working tonight."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit."
"8","Leonard: Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world."
"8","Sheldon: Thinking caps on."
"8","Howard: Here we go."
"8","Raj: Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie."
"8","Howard: Oh. I never saw that."
"8","Sheldon: Really?"
"8","Raj: Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it."
"8","Raj: Cool. I’ll make the popcorn."
"8","Leonard: Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV."
"8","Sheldon: I’m sorry. Is that a no?"
"8","Howard: Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?"
"8","Leonard: I, I think I still have it."
"8","Sheldon: I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now."
"8","Leonard: Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend."
"8","Howard: Mm, that was mine."
"8","Leonard: Robot prostitute."
"8","Howard: Also mine."
"8","Sheldon: Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?"
"8","Howard: There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend."
"8","Raj: Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit."
"8","Leonard: Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion."
"8","Howard: No, it vibrates. Keep going."
"8","Leonard: You know, let’s just come up with something new."
"8","Sheldon: You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact."
"8","Raj: Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet."
"8","Leonard: How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?"
"8","Sheldon: If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application."
"8","Leonard: Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."
"8","Raj: Oh, I have an idea."
"8","Sheldon: I think I have the same one."
"8","Howard: We got to watch Back to the Future II."
"8","Raj: I’ll make the popcorn."
"8","Scene: A Vegas hotel room."
"8","Penny: So, where should we go first?"
"8","Amy: Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge."
"8","Penny: Nah."
"8","Amy: But they play Barry Manilow."
"8","Penny: No."
"8","Amy: But they’re called Fairly Manilow."
"8","Penny: Oh. Okay."
"8","Amy: Great."
"8","Bernadette: Well, what do you want to do?"
"8","Penny: Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere."
"8","Amy: What if we don’t want to vomit?"
"8","Penny: Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh."
"8","Amy: What?"
"8","Penny: It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday."
"8","Amy: What does that mean?"
"8","Penny: It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days."
"8","Bernadette: That sucks."
"8","Amy: Can you start in the morning?"
"8","Penny: Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later."
"8","Bernadette: You sure?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead."
"8","Amy: So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…"
"8","Bernadette: We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow."
"8","Amy: Okay."
"8","Howard: Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in."
"8","Leoanard: This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet."
"8","Sheldon: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?"
"8","Leonard: What do you mean?"
"8","Sheldon: Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?"
"8","Leonard: Had will have placed?"
"8","Sheldon: That’s my boy."
"8","Leonard: Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!"
"8","Howard: What?"
"8","Sheldon: Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…"
"8","Leonard: Wait. Is brought right?"
"8","Sheldon: Marty and Doc never had have had brought?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t know. You did it to me."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t."
"8","Raj: He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff."
"8","Howard: Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies."
"8","Leonard: Guys."
"8","Sheldon: Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?"
"8","Raj: Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?"
"8","Leonard: Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t think it worked."
"8","Scene: A bar in Vegas."
"8","Amy: Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow."
"8","Bernadette: I think after this, I’ll be dead."
"8","Amy: Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying."
"8","Bernadette: I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously."
"8","Amy: It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re looking good."
"8","Bernadette: We are."
"8","Amy: Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’."
"8","Bernadette: Amy."
"8","Amy: Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?"
"8","Bernadette: You’re embarrassing me."
"8","Amy: Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Amy: No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s laboratory."
"8","Leonard: All right."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here."
"8","Raj: Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work."
"8","Leonard: So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology."
"8","Howard: Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that."
"8","Raj: Go online and look it up."
"8","Shortly afterwards."
"8","Howard: Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener."
"8","Raj: That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is."
"8","Leonard: I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?"
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?"
"8","Howard: Like behavior modification?"
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?"
"8","Raj: That cannot be true."
"8","Raj: Hey, it was match point."
"8","Leonard: Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic."
"8","Raj: Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind."
"8","Howard: We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked."
"8","Sheldon: Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue."
"8","Leonard: If only we had one."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I’ll check Amazon."
"8","Scene: The hotel room."
"8","Bernadette: Housekeeping."
"8","Amy: We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there."
"8","Bernadette: It was us the whole time."
"8","Amy: Why’d you tell her? It was working."
"8","Bernadette: Was it working?"
"8","Penny: Yeah."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, I’m so sorry."
"8","Penny: You guys look like you’re having fun."
"8","Amy: We’re having the best time."
"8","Bernadette: Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps."
"8","Penny: That’s a dollar."
"8","Bernadette: Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress."
"8","Amy: Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers."
"8","Bernadette: We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction."
"8","Penny: That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do."
"8","Amy: Can you believe this nerd?"
"8","Bernadette: Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man’s G-string like a baby kangaroo?"
"8","Penny: All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I’ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman."
"8","Amy: Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let’s just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I’m gonna quiz you. I’m gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they’re gonna be at the strip club."
"8","Bernadette: Aren’t you gonna chase her?"
"8","Penny: To the walk-in closet? Sure."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s lab."
"8","Leonard: Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off."
"8","Raj: And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her."
"8","Leonard: All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…"
"8","Sheldon: Wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?"
"8","Leonard: I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not, we’ll take a vote. Oh, and also…"
"8","Sheldon: Ow. We didn’t vote!"
"8","Leonard: We didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?"
"8","Sheldon: You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That’s a tangent and it’s your fault."
"8","Howard: That’s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent."
"8","Leonard: Thank you. And now I owe you one."
"8","Sheldon: Ow. That was your fault."
"8","Howard: Hey."
"8","Raj: Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I’m gonna hear it from Jenny."
"8","Leonard: Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn’t working."
"8","Sheldon: I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a common mistake."
"8","Howard: Negative reinforcement is really wrong?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters."
"8","Raj: No way. Not Bill Murray."
"8","Bill Murray (on screen): I’m studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability."
"8","(on screen)"
"8","Raj: Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong."
"8","Howard: Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man."
"8","Leonard: No."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard’s right. We can’t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie."
"8","Leonard: Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark."
"8","Raj: Yeah, sorry for clicking on that."
"8","Leonard: It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?"
"8","Sheldon: But we didn’t see them bust one ghost."
"8","Leonard: So you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?"
"8","Sheldon: No."
"8","All: Ghostbusters!"
"8","Leonard: It really does hold up."
"8","Scene: The Vegas strip club."
"8","Bernadette: See? Isn’t this better than a hotel room?"
"8","Penny: Yep. Shake that thing."
"8","Bernadette: Have you ever seen a body so fine?"
"8","Amy: We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that."
"8","Penny: Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it’s bright out. Isn’t it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye."
"8","Bernadette: Would you please close the drapes?"
"8","Series 08 Episode 06 – The Expedition Approximation"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Bernadette: I like your suit."
"8","Penny: Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work."
"8","Howard: How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?"
"8","Leonard: She doesn’t flirt with doctors."
"8","Penny: Yeah. It’s all very professional."
"8","Amy: You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?"
"8","Penny: Okay, good."
"8","Bernadette: Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field."
"8","Bernadette: Oh. What’s going on?"
"8","Sheldon: I started doing it."
"8","Raj: You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, I’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines."
"8","Raj: You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."
"8","Penny: Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?"
"8","Sheldon: Why not?"
"8","Penny: You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash."
"8","Sheldon: Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned."
"8","Leonard: I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba."
"8","Howard:If they get scared, they’ll have those hats with the lights on them, ’cause down there it’s night-night all the time."
"8","Bernadette: Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost."
"8","Sheldon:Are they making fun of us?"
"8","Raj: Yup."
"8","Sheldon: I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Leonard: So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga."
"8","Penny: I’m sorry, I was thinking about work."
"8","Leonard: Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…"
"8","Penny: Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news."
"8","Leonard: Hmm."
"8","Penny: This is for you."
"8","Leonard: Huh. What is this?"
"8","Penny: Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one."
"8","Leonard: The one I gave you?"
"8","Penny: Yeah. And there’s your money back, and now we’re even. How great is that?"
"8","Leonard: Uh, yeah."
"8","Penny: What?"
"8","Leonard: Nothing."
"8","Penny: Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both."
"8","Leonard: You’re right."
"8","Penny: What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?"
"8","Leonard: Doesn’t sound that bad."
"8","Penny: Well, good, because that’s what I did."
"8","Leonard: Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet."
"8","Penny: Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage."
"8","Leonard: You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it."
"8","Penny: Why?"
"8","Leonard: The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out."
"8","Penny: And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go."
"8","Leonard: Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in."
"8","Penny: Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now."
"8","Leonard: I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this."
"8","Penny: Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight."
"8","Leonard: I don’t, either."
"8","Penny: Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?"
"8","Leonard: Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex."
"8","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"8","Raj: Hey, Sheldon, you busy?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies."
"8","Raj: Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?"
"8","Sheldon: Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?"
"8","Raj: So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’m from Texas and you’re from India, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next."
"8","Raj: It’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next."
"8","Raj: Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah? We have to be somewhere."
"8","Raj: Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket."
"8","Sheldon: So it’s settled, we’re not doing it."
"8","Raj: Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment."
"8","Sheldon: Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it."
"8","Raj: Exactly."
"8","Sheldon: Very well."
"8","Raj: So where should we do it?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up."
"8","Raj: Uh, Sheldon…"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos."
"8","Leonard: Hey, you got a sec?"
"8","Penny: Hi. Sure."
"8","Leonard: I was hoping we could talk about the money again."
"8","Penny: Oh, sweetie, just forget about it."
"8","Leonard: No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night."
"8","Penny: Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird."
"8","Leonard: Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution."
"8","Penny: Mm."
"8","Leonard: Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever."
"8","Penny: You know what, that’s great. I love that."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, of course you do, I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby."
"8","Penny: You two want to be alone?"
"8","Leonard: I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you."
"8","Penny: Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I’m trying to be sensitive to that."
"8","Leonard: What?"
"8","Penny: Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary."
"8","Leonard: Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues."
"8","Penny: Control issues?"
"8","Leonard: Maybe."
"8","Penny: Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure."
"8","Leonard: Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities."
"8","Penny: You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?"
"8","Penny: Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers."
"8","Scene: The university basement."
"8","Raj: Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here."
"8","Amy: Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority."
"8","Raj: Did you get in?"
"8","Amy: No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores."
"8","Sheldon: Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines."
"8","Raj: This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym."
"8","Sheldon: Plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked."
"8","Raj: Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame."
"8","Sheldon: All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?"
"8","Amy: Save you first; come back for Raj only if there’s time."
"8","Raj: We’re going to be fine."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, I’m really impressed you’re willing to try this."
"8","Sheldon: Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list."
"8","Raj: I’m sweating already."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know."
"8","Raj: How hot is it?"
"8","Sheldon: Uh, let’s see. 704? No, wait, it’s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees."
"8","Raj: Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be."
"8","Sheldon: True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Leonard: Thanks again for having us."
"8","Howard: Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?"
"8","Penny: Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple."
"8","Bernadette: I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them."
"8","Howard: I didn’t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard’s feelings."
"8","Leonard: Well, nailed it."
"8","Howard: So what did you want to know?"
"8","Penny: Well, do you guys ever fight over money?"
"8","Bernadette: Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie."
"8","Howard: You didn’t have to say so much more."
"8","Bernadette: Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should."
"8","Howard: I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too."
"8","Bernadette: Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?"
"8","Howard: For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay."
"8","Bernadette: Without asking me?"
"8","Howard: There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home."
"8","Bernadette: How much, Howie?"
"8","Howard: Not a lot."
"8","Bernadette: How much?"
"8","Howard: Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends."
"8","Bernadette: Was it more or less than falconry school?"
"8","Howard: For the tenth time, that was a Groupon."
"8","Leonard: Like I would swing with him."
"8","Scene: The steam tunnel."
"8","Raj: How you feeling?"
"8","Sheldon: Good. Little claustrophobic."
"8","Raj: Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it."
"8","Sheldon: Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up."
"8","Raj: Do you know any mining songs?"
"8","Sheldon: Just the hits. (Singing) Where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew."
"8","(Singing)"
"8","Rajj: That’s pretty."
"8","Sheldon: Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine."
"8","Raj: It’s a little more bleak than I thought."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal."
"8","Raj: Getting kind of grim."
"8","Sheldon: Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones."
"8","Raj: Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?"
"8","Sheldon: Who’s he?"
"8","Howard: Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn’t also doing everything else around here."
"8","Howard: Oh, you’re saying I don’t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart."
"8","Leonard: She made him a chore chart."
"8","Penny: I see it."
"8","Howard: Do the dishes. There’s a star right there."
"8","Bernadette: That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes."
"8","Howard: That pan had to soak and you know it."
"8","Bernadette: Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance."
"8","Howard: It’s not an allowance. It’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends."
"8","Leonard: I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good."
"8","Raj: So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache."
"8","Sheldon: That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?"
"8","Raj: But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?"
"8","Sheldon: He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality."
"8","Amy (shouting): You guys doing okay down there?"
"8","(shouting)"
"8","Sheldon: I told you to use the walkie-talkie!"
"8","Amy (on walkie-talkie): You guys doing okay down there?"
"8","(on walkie-talkie)"
"8","Sheldon: Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you."
"8","Amy: I’m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?"
"8","Sheldon: This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought."
"8","Amy: Okay, just checking."
"8","Raj: We should have asked her to get some Funyuns."
"8","Sheldon: You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth."
"8","Raj: What if we brought them down with us?"
"8","Sheldon: We’ll take some Funyuns."
"8","Amy: Anything else?"
"8","Sheldon: Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana."
"8","Rajj: Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself."
"8","Bernadette: Sorry you guys had to see that."
"8","Penny: Oh, don’t apologize."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened."
"8","Bernadette: Money’s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income."
"8","Penny: It really bothers him?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, sure. There’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him."
"8","Penny: Uh-oh."
"8","Penny: Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you."
"8","Leonard: Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what I think love looks like."
"8","Bernadette: I’ll be right back. I’m gonna go check on him."
"8","Penny: Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do."
"8","Leonard: Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us."
"8","Penny: It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married."
"8","Howard (off): Why are you being so bossy?"
"8","(off)"
"8","Bernadette (off): Why are you being a baby?"
"8","Howard (off): I’m not a baby. I’m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where’s my star?"
"8","Leonard: Should we go?"
"8","Penny: Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star."
"8","Raj: Oh, this heat is brutal."
"8","Sheldon: As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature."
"8","Rajj: Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings."
"8","Sheldon: My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay."
"8","Raj: How’s that going?"
"8","Sheldon: You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs."
"8","Raj: Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop."
"8","Sheldon: We’re not stopping."
"8","Raj: You don’t have to bite my head off."
"8","Sheldon: I apologize. I just, I’m plagued by an internal struggle."
"8","Raj: If you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable."
"8","Sheldon: My struggle is emotional."
"8","Raj: Oh. Is it Amy?"
"8","Sheldon: It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening."
"8","Raj: Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager."
"8","Sheldon: Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?"
"8","Raj: The space probe."
"8","Sheldon: Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show."
"8","Raj: By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this."
"8",""
"8","Amy: Sheldon, is everything okay?"
"8","Sheldon: It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go."
"8","Amy: 11 minutes. That’s longer than I thought."
"8","Raj (off): They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt."
"8","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"8","Penny: Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money."
"8","Leonard: I’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It’s my first time, too."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"8","Bernadette: I’m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff."
"8","Howard: It’s okay."
"8","Bernadette: No, it’s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship."
"8","Howard: I want that, too."
"8","Bernadette: Now, let’s talk about your birthday party."
"8","Howard: Ooh, laser tag, laser tag."
"8","Bernadette: Oh."
"8","Amy: Do you really need me to transcribe this?"
"8","Sheldon: You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle. (Voice on recorder) Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost."
"8","(Voice on recorder)"
"8","Raj: You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward."
"8","Sheldon: His statements of the obvious continue to annoy."
"8","Series 08 Episode 07 – The Misinterpretation Agitation"
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Bernadette: So, what are you working on these days?"
"8","Amy: I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame."
"8","Bernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?"
"8","Penny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear."
"8","Bermadette: Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news."
"8","Penny: Okay, if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us."
"8","Bernadette: He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?"
"8","Amy: I think it’s awful."
"8","Penny: Why would you say that?"
"8","Amy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?"
"8","Penny: I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist."
"8","Bernadette: Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?"
"8","Amy: I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead."
"8","Penny: Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls."
"8","Amy: Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science."
"8","Bernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad."
"8","Penny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: The building foyer."
"8","Man with Flowers: Thank you."
"8","Sheldon: No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know."
"8","Man: I’m not a delivery man, I’m a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients."
"8","Sheldon: That’s humorous."
"8","Man: All right."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous."
"8","Sheldon: Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke."
"8","Man: All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office."
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you."
"8","Man: I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door."
"8","Sheldon: Making the extra effort. Good for you."
"8","Leonard: Great timing, food just got here."
"8","Sheldon: Ooh, Siam Palace?"
"8","Leonard: Yes."
"8","Sheldon: Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?"
"8","Sheldon: Uh, extra peanut sauce?"
"8","Leonard: No, but you can have mine."
"8","Sheldon: Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak."
"8","Leonard: What? Why didn’t you say that first?"
"8","Sheldon: Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game."
"8","Leonard: Can I help you?"
"8","Man: Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?"
"8","Leonard: May I ask why?"
"8","Man: Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship."
"8","Leonard: Okay, um, look, I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you."
"8","Man: Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two…"
"8","Leonard: I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée."
"8","Man: Really? I’ve never seen her wear an engagement ring."
"8","Raj: Really?"
"8","Man: So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?"
"8","Leonard: I think so."
"8","Man: When will I learn? It’s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again."
"8","Leonard: Excuse me?"
"8","Man: Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You’re a, you’re a lucky man."
"8","Leonard: Thank you. Sorry."
"8","Man: Oh, uh, you probably don’t want her to see this. It’s unnecessarily graphic."
"8","Sheldon: Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage."
"8","Leonard: He tried to score with Penny."
"8","Sheldon: So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us."
"8","Scene: A bar."
"8","Amy: So, how was work today?"
"8","Bernadette: It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article."
"8","Amy: What happened?"
"8","Bernadette: I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it."
"8","Amy: Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine."
"8","Bernadette: I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here."
"8","Amy: Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled."
"8","Bernadette: What? How?"
"8","Amy: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail."
"8","Bernadette: Amy, what did you say?"
"8","Amy: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress."
"8","Bernadette: Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche."
"8","Amy: Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day."
"8","Bernadette: No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity."
"8","Amy: But it was bad publicity."
"8","Bernadette: That’s for me to decide, not you."
"8","Amy: I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us."
"8","Bernadette: And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line."
"8","Amy: You have a nice night."
"8","Bernadette: Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey."
"8","Man: Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show."
"8","Raj: Oh, cool."
"8","Howard: How’d you get that?"
"8","Man: Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy."
"8","Sehldon: Wait a minute. You’ve snipped Gene Roddenberry’s vas deferens?"
"8","Man: Yes."
"8","Howard: Wow, he really went where no man has gone before."
"8","Man: I don’t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I’m kind of the doctor to the stars’ urinary tracts."
"8","All: Wow."
"8","Man: Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron’s kidney stone?"
"8","All: Ooh."
"8","Man: He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator."
"8","Leonard: That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?"
"8","Man: Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn’t really get serious until William Shatner’s bladder infection."
"8","Sheldon: What’d you get? What’d you get?"
"8","Man: Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it’s pretty cool."
"8","Raj: I would love to see your collection."
"8","Man: Anytime. Uh, I’ve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know."
"8","Howard: We know."
"8","Raj: Preach."
"8","Man: Can I ask you a personal question?"
"8","Leonard: Sure."
"8","Man: Um, I mean, you’re a guy like me, so how’d you get a girl like Penny?"
"8","Leonard: Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him."
"8","Leonard: I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection."
"8","Howard: A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra."
"8","Leonard: Can we please change the subject?"
"8","Penny: Hi."
"8","Raj: Well, that didn’t go your way."
"8","Penny: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Uh, well, actually I came to see you."
"8","Penny: Really? Why?"
"8","Leonard: Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis."
"8","Penny: Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on."
"8","Dr Lorvis: You touched my arm for two Mississippis."
"8","Penny: Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi."
"8","Leonard: Can we talk in private?"
"8","Penny: Please, yes."
"8","Leonard: I’ll be right back."
"8","Sheldon: So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?"
"8","Leonard: So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?"
"8","Penny: What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket."
"8","Leonard: Why?"
"8","Penny: Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?"
"8","Leonard: Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage."
"8","Penny: You were okay with that?"
"8","Leonard: No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too."
"8","Penny: Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?"
"8","Leonard: A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy."
"8","Penny: Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him."
"8","Leonard: Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?"
"8","Penny: I can’t do it, he’s my best client."
"8","Leonard: All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one."
"8","Raj: Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, sure. You owe me."
"8","Scene: Dr Lorvis’ basement."
"8","Leonard: Oh, my God."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude."
"8","Howard: Oh, come on. It’s a replica."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Original."
"8","Howard: Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife."
"8","Raj: The gun from Hellboy?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Yup."
"8","Raj: How did you get it?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Bought it at auction."
"8","Raj: Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles."
"8","Woman’s voice (off): Oliver, I’m going to play bingo."
"8","(off)"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Okay, Mother. Have fun."
"8","Howard: Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?"
"8","Raj: Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond."
"8","Leonard: Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid."
"8","Sheldon: Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?"
"8","Leonard: No, because I liked it."
"8","Sheldon: Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl."
"8","Dr Lorvis: So, I’ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny."
"8","Sheldon: Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure."
"8","Dr Lorvis: So, you think she’ll be single soon?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something."
"8","Leonard: What?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m still upset about that peanut sauce."
"8","Scene: The lobby."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Oh, could you hold the door?"
"8","Amy: Nice flowers."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Thank you. They’re for a girl. Uh, I’m being implacable and relentless."
"8","Amy: Isn’t she lucky?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing."
"8","Amy: What’s that?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Unconditional love."
"8","Amy: I guess that’s all anybody wants."
"8","Dr Lorvis: I guess so."
"8","Amy: Well, I hope you get it."
"8","Dr Lorvis: One Mississippi, two Mississippi."
"8","Leonard: Next game, let’s switch helmets."
"8","Sheldon: No, I’d look silly in that helmet."
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Amy: I can’t take these."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis."
"8","Amy: But what about the other girl?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Oh, right. I’ll tell her we should just be friends."
"8","Penny: Dr. Lorvis?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?"
"8","Raj: You think he bites?"
"8","Howard: Stick your head in there and find out."
"8","Raj: You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again."
"8","Leonard: I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while."
"8","Raj: Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy."
"8","Howard: It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings."
"8","Raj: Okay, now you’re messing with me."
"8","Leonard: Uh, guys, we’re locked in here."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, this day just keeps getting better."
"8","Penny: So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met."
"8","Amy: We all have a past."
"8","Penny: Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy."
"8","Dr Lorvis: You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom."
"8","Penny: Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Well, that’s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies."
"8","Penny (on phone): Hey, Leonard. Guess who’s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?"
"8","(on phone)"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Well, they’re, they’re not locked in. The door just sticks."
"8","Penny: Okay, so how do they unstick it?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: They’d need the key."
"8","Penny: Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Three Mississippi, four Mississippi."
"8","Penny: Move it."
"8","Scene: The foyer."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry."
"8","Amy: That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: She seems nice. Who’s she?"
"8","Penny: Just walk."
"8","Sheldon: You can do this."
"8","Raj: One ladder left."
"8","Leonard: Oh-hom yeah."
"8","Howard: Yes."
"8","Leonard: Next level."
"8","Penny: Leonard, are you okay?"
"8","Leonard: Better than okay. I am having the game of my life."
"8","Amy: Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?"
"8","Dr Lorvis: Yes. I’m very sorry for locking you in my home."
"8","Howard: Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer."
"8","Leonard: Got it."
"8","Penny: Okay, Leonard, let’s go."
"8","Leonard: Just hang on."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire’s prostate sonogram?"
"8","Amy: Sure."
"8","Penny: Yeah."
"8","Dr Lorvis: Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing."
"8","Series 08 Episode 08 – The Prom Equivalency"
"8","Scene: The cafeteria."
"8","Leonard: Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night."
"8","Howard: Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld."
"8","Leonard: I know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart."
"8","Howard: That’s fine. I don’t care."
"8","Rajj: It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?"
"8","Howard: They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner."
"8","Raj: And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins."
"8","Howard: Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating."
"8","Raj: Like who?"
"8","Howard: Like you and your dog."
"8","Leonard: Don’t rule out the dating."
"8","Howard: Fine, it bothers me. You happy?"
"8","Sheldon: You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape."
"8","Howard: How is this helpful?"
"8","Sheldon: All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef."
"8","Leonard: But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon."
"8","Sheldon: True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Penny’s Apartment."
"8","Amy: Hi."
"8","Penny: Hey."
"8","Bernadette: We brought snacks for movie night."
"8","Penny: Oh, great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper."
"8","Bernadette: Right here."
"8","Penny: Ah, You guys are the best."
"8","Amy: What’s with the clothes?"
"8","Penny: Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet."
"8","Amy: I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?"
"8","Penny: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress."
"8","Bernadette: Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere."
"8","Penny: What kind of teenager did you think I was?"
"8","Bernadette: Slutty."
"8","Amy: Easy."
"8","Penny: The word is popular."
"8","Bernadette: How was your prom? Did you go?"
"8","Amy: No, but I was on clean-up crew."
"8","Penny: Aw, that’s sad."
"8","Amy: No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red."
"8","Bernadette: My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her."
"8","Amy: Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging."
"8","Penny: Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways."
"8","Bernadette: Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team."
"8","Penny: No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking."
"8","Amy: My date would’ve had to clean that up."
"8","Bernadette: Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over."
"8","Amy: Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos."
"8","Bernadette: Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance."
"8","Penny: Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be."
"8","Amy: You went to seven proms?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Howard: Hey."
"8","Raj: Hey."
"8","Leonard: Hey, where’s Bernadette?"
"8","Howard: She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing."
"8","Raj: Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster."
"8","Howard: Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling."
"8","Raj: Did you go to your prom?"
"8","Sheldon: No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…"
"8","Penny: Okay, okay."
"8","Shldon: …of AP Calculus."
"8","Raj: How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?"
"8","Leonard: Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?"
"8","Penny: Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?"
"8","Leonard: Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you."
"8","Penny: Ugh, thanks a lot."
"8","Leonard: What?"
"8","Penny: Well, now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch."
"8","Raj: That sounds like a yes."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Bernadette: Ooh, every single person RSVP’d yes. This is so exciting. Isn’t this exciting?"
"8","Howard: Yep."
"8","Bernadette: Look, even Stuart’s bringing a date. I wonder who it is."
"8","Howard: You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?"
"8","Bernadette: Because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can’t he take your mom? You took her to your prom."
"8","Howard: I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone."
"8","Bernadette: I saw a picture of you two dancing together."
"8","Howard: What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore."
"8","Stuart (on phone): Hello."
"8","(on phone)"
"8","Howard: Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It’s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party I’m going to? What the hell?"
"8","Stuart: I’m not bringing your mother, I have a date."
"8","Howard: Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?"
"8","Stuart: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There’s nothing weird going on with me and your mother."
"8","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, your bath is getting cold!"
"8","(off)"
"8","Stuart: I got to go, bye."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?"
"8","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"8","Penny: You knocked more than usual."
"8","Sheldon: Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank."
"8","Penny: Okay, what’s up?"
"8","Sheldon: I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it."
"8","Penny: Great, how?"
"8","Sheldon: We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy."
"8","Penny: Okay, just one question. What?"
"8","Sheldon: My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up."
"8","Penny: Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?"
"8","Sheldon: There are post-prom mating rituals?"
"8","Penny: Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always."
"8","Sheldon: Well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then I’m open to it."
"8","Penny: You’re kidding."
"8","Sheldon: I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on."
"8","Leonard: You know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons."
"8","Sheldon: Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on."
"8","Leonard: Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him."
"8","Sheldon: His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does."
"8","Leonard: There, perfect."
"8","Sheldon: What, are you sure? It’s my first prom, I want to do it correctly."
"8","Leonard: I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien."
"8","Sheldon: I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody."
"8","Leonard: Was that a flask?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch."
"8","Leonard: You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants."
"8","Leonard: If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook."
"8","Leonard: And while you’re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to."
"8","Sheldon: Why would you say that?"
"8","Leonard: You know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night."
"8","Sheldon: Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?"
"8","Leonard: Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones."
"8","Leonard: Wow, you look amazing."
"8","Penny: Thank you, so do you."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, you look so handsome."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you."
"8","Penny: Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin."
"8","Amy: What’s that?"
"8","Leonard: Oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing."
"8","Sheldon: Excuse me."
"8","Amy: Where are you going?"
"8","Sheldon: I can’t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck."
"8","Leonard: He’s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin."
"8","Scene: A limo."
"8","Raj: Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close."
"8","Bernadette: That’s a neat tattoo."
"8","Emily: Oh, thanks, it’s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas."
"8","Bernadette: Aw, that movie’s so cute."
"8","Howard: Do you like her because you both have red hair?"
"8","Emily: Uh, a little, but more that she’s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on."
"8","Bernadette: I like Cinderella."
"8","Emily: Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?"
"8","Bernadette: I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."
"8","Raj: Hey, here comes Stuart and his date."
"8","Emily: Oh, she’s cute."
"8","Howard: Oh, my God."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Howard: That’s Jeanie."
"8","Bernadette: That’s Jeanie?"
"8","Emily: Who’s Jeanie?"
"8","Howard: Don’t say it."
"8","Raj: That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with."
"8","Howard: She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don’t say it."
"8","Emily: No, it’s okay. He told me that story a long time ago."
"8","Howard: Raj."
"8","Raj: It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?"
"8","Scene: The rooftop."
"8","Penny: Oh, it’s beautiful."
"8","Leonard: Oh, the girls really did a nice job."
"8","Penny: Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom."
"8","Leonard: What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went."
"8","Penny: Well, who’d you go with?"
"8","Leonard: I took a little lady I like to call loneliness."
"8","Penny: Aw."
"8","Leonard: Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…"
"8","Penny: Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance."
"8","Leonard: No, you wouldn’t have."
"8","Penny: Well, you don’t know that."
"8","Leonard: It was before my growth spurt."
"8","Penny: What, that already happened?"
"8","Leonard: Very funny."
"8","Penny: Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either."
"8","Leonard: I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry."
"8","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, can I come in?"
"8","Sheldon: I don’t think that’s a good idea."
"8","Amy: Why not?"
"8","Sheldon: According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day."
"8","Amy: You’re making me worry. What’s going on?"
"8","Sheldon: What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee."
"8","Amy: What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?"
"8","Sheldon: It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants."
"8","Sceme: The limo."
"8","Stuart: So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys’. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel."
"8","Rajj: Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?"
"8","Howard: So, my mother’s okay with this?"
"8","Jeannie: Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?"
"8","Howard: ‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship."
"8","Jeannie: Weirder than what you and I did in my dad’s Corolla?"
"8","Raj: This is so messed up."
"8","Emily: I know, I’m having the best time."
"8","Howard: Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?"
"8","Jeannie: It was a long time ago, Howard."
"8","Stuart: And you’re only second cousins, who cares?"
"8","Bernadette: So, you knew and you brought her anyway?"
"8","Stuart: Oh, so she’s good enough for Howard, but not for me?"
"8","Howard: Yeah."
"8","Bernadette: Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf."
"8","Penny: Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now."
"8","Leonard: There’s no music."
"8","Penny: I don’t care. We’ll make our own music."
"8","Leonard: My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats."
"8","Penny: Thank you for wearing your heels."
"8","Leonard: Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom."
"8","Penny: Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?"
"8","Leonard: I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming."
"8","Penny: I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama."
"8","Scene: The limo."
"8","Bernadette: Howie, get off of him."
"8","Howard: Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree."
"8","Scene: Sheldon’s bedrooom."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, this is silly. I’m not missing another prom. I’m going upstairs now. Good-bye."
"8","Sheldon: I really did think you looked pretty."
"8","Amy: You did?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes. So much so that I started to panic."
"8","Amy: Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together."
"8","Sheldon: Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?"
"8","Amy: I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you for understanding."
"8","Amy: Of course I understand. Sheldon, there’s something else I’ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. I know you’re not ready, and I don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…"
"8","Sheldon: I love you, too."
"8","Amy: You said it."
"8","Sheldon: There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated."
"8","Amy: Okay."
"8","Sheldon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room."
"8","Raj: Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…"
"8","Iskip)"
"8","Stuart: Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. (On phone) Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I’m here with Jeanie. Okay, but we’re just friends. It’s, yeah. I got to go."

"8","Series 08 Episode 09 – The Septum Deviation"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Amy: This is an easy one. You love this guy."
"8","Sheldon: Me."
"8","Amy: Come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius."
"8","Sheldon: Still think it’s me."
"8","Amy: It’s not you. Now think, there’s a car named after him."
"8","Sheldon: Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me."
"8","Amy: How about this, he’s a poor man’s Sheldon Cooper."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, Tesla."
"8","Penny: Hi."
"8","Amy: Hello."
"8","Sheldon: Hey, how did it go?"
"8","Leonard: Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses."
"8","Penny: Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka."
"8","Amy: Did they figure out what’s wrong?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week."
"8","Sheldon: Why would you have surgery?"
"8","Leonard: Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections."
"8","Penny: Yeah, back off, he’s all mine."
"8","Sheldon: But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?"
"8","Amy: Sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, I’ve heard you complain about his snoring."
"8","Sheldon: Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. End of story."
"8","Sheldon: Very well. I’m done talking about it."
"8","Leonard: Thank you."
"8","Sheldon: I believe it was your turn in the game."
"8","Amy: Okay."
"8","Sheldon: Let’s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak."
"8","Leonard: I think you could give a better clue."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom."
"8","Leonard: Okay, why?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it."
"8","Leonard: If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?"
"8","Sheldon: Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?"
"8","Leonard: What’s your problem?"
"8","Sheldon: If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone."
"8","Leonard: It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest."
"8","Sheldon: I have to be honest with you Leonard, I’m truly worried."
"8","Leonard: I told you, there’s nothing to worry about."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia."
"8","Leonard: Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?"
"8","Sheldon: I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Raj: Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them."
"8","Howard: Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?"
"8","Bernadette: Not anymore."
"8","Raj: Anyway, any ideas on a gift?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, what are some of the things they like?"
"8","Raj: They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in."
"8","Bernadette: He said that to her?"
"8","Raj: Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you."
"8","Bernadette: They’re yours in the divorce."
"8","Leonard: Hey. What’re you working on?"
"8","Sheldon: Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300."
"8","Leonard: Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?"
"8","Leonard: I’m not allergic to latex."
"8","Sheldon: Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?"
"8","Leonard: For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair net."
"8","Sheldon: Fine. What about epilepsy?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t have epilepsy, either."
"8","Sheldon: You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?"
"8","Sheldon: I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life."
"8","Leonard: Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I’m not going to die."
"8","Sheldon: You don’t know that."
"8","Leonard: Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike."
"8","Sheldon: You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car."
"8","Leonard: If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?"
"8","Sheldon: I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way."
"8","Leonard: Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll think about it."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death."
"8","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"8","Raj (on phone): Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye."
"8","(on phone):"
"8","Howard: So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are."
"8","Raj: Dude, my parents just split up."
"8","Howard: What?"
"8","Raj: Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out."
"8","Howard: Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here."
"8","Raj: No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali."
"8","Howard: You sure you’re okay?"
"8","Raj: I’m okay."
"8","Howard: You don’t look okay."
"8","Raj: How can I be okay? I come from a broken home."
"8","Scene: A waiting room."
"8","Leonard: The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten."
"8","Penny: Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?"
"8","Leonard: He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it."
"8","Scene: Amy’s car."
"8","Sheldon: 18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it."
"8","Amy: Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work."
"8","Sheldon: Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl."
"8","Amy: It’s nice they’re getting exercise."
"8","Sheldon: Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt."
"8","Amy: I’m sure he brought it."
"8","Sheldon: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it."
"8","Amy: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it."
"8","Sheldon: You’re acting odd. Why?"
"8","Amy: I’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth."
"8","Sheldon: Tell me the truth."
"8","Amy: Twenty eight."
"8","Sheldon: Come on."
"8","Amy: Fifty six."
"8","Sheldon: Amy. What’s going on?"
"8","Amy: All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now."
"8","Sheldon: I see. Take me to Leonard."
"8","Amy: Just go to work, he’ll be fine."
"8","Sheldon: Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, I’m going there anyway."
"8","Amy: Fine. It’s sweet that you care about him so much."
"8","Sheldon: I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so."
"8","Scene: The waiting room."
"8","Sheldon: Hello."
"8","Penny: We had a really nice swim."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire."
"8","Penny: ‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?"
"8","Sheldon: That’s for the fire marshal to determine."
"8","Penny: You had to tell him?"
"8","Amy: He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today."
"8","Sheldon: Is he okay?"
"8","Penny: He’s still in surgery."
"8","Sheldon: Very well."
"8","Penny: He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky."
"8","Amy: Come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery."
"8","Sheldon: That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?"
"8","Penny: I think she meant something a little happier."
"8","Sheldon: I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young."
"8","Scene: Raj’s office."
"8","Howard: Knock, knock."
"8","Bernadette: Hi."
"8","Raj: Hey. What brings you by?"
"8","Bernadette: Oh, muffin much."
"8","Howard: Told you, not funny."
"8","Bernadette: He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd."
"8","Raj: I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks."
"8","Howard: So, how you doing?"
"8","Raj: Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected."
"8","Bernadette: Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up."
"8","Howard: Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother."
"8","Bernadette: Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off."
"8","Howard: As you can see, we’re here to cheer you up."
"8","Bernadette: Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?"
"8","Raj: I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew."
"8","Bernadette: It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?"
"8","Penny: Oh, it’s nice you got him that."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, this isn’t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me."
"8","Amy: Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in."
"8","Sheldon: You know those confounded things make me dizzy."
"8","Amy: Who told you to keep going around?"
"8","Sheldon: There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside."
"8","Penny: Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time."
"8","Amy: Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself."
"8","Sheldon: It was like a grapefruit."
"8","Amy: And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me."
"8","Penny: Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass."
"8","Sheldon: The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was."
"8","Penny: Really? You won’t even say A?"
"8","Sheldon: You bet your sweet B I won’t."
"8","Penny: Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him."
"8","Sheldon: And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it."
"8","Penny: Sheldon, it was just a little tremor."
"8","Sheldon: A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don’t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he’s okay."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, you can’t go back there."
"8","Sheldon: Try and stop me."
"8","Amy: Are you okay?"
"8","Sheldon: Why didn’t you stop me?"
"8","Bernadette: Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us."
"8","Howard: What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s parents probably split up because of Raj."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Howard: They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on."
"8","Bernadette: I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don’t want that to happen to us."
"8","Howard: How can I convince you it won’t?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?"
"8","Howard: I’m not answering that. It’s a trap."
"8","Bernadette: So there are things you don’t like."
"8","Howard: And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m gonna chew my leg off."
"8","Bernadette: Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won’t get mad."
"8","Howard: Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful."
"8","Bernadette: Oh. Howie, be serious."
"8","Howard: Okay, okay. I really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea."
"8","Howard: I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…"
"8","Bernadette: Who were you in couples therapy with?"
"8","Howard: Not important."
"8","Bernadette: Was it your mom?"
"8","Bernadette: It was your mom."
"8","Howard: Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that."
"8","Howard: All right."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh."
"8","Howard: Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and independent."
"8","Bernadette: And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me."
"8","Howard: I love that I’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that."
"8","Bernadette: Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that."
"8","Howard: See, I am. Isn’t this great?"
"8","Penny: Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card."
"8","Sheldon: You know this is all your fault."
"8","Leonard: How is it my fault?"
"8","Sheldon: I told you not to get the surgery."
"8","Leonard: Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn’t even want you there."
"8","Sheldon: Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you."
"8","Amy: Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out."
"8","Penny: Yeah, ’cause you sound really funny."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out."
"8","Leonard: I never thought I’d say these words, but come on, nose spider."
"8","Penny: Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him."
"8","Amy: Sheldon will move out eventually."
"8","Penny: Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door."
"8","Sheldon: I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard."
"8","Leonard: You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there."
"8","Bernadette: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair."
"8","Howard: I love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink."
"8","Bernadette: I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought."
"8","Howard: And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It’s like washing myself with a hamster."
"8","Raj: Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, how is she?"
"8","Raj: Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you guys?"
"8","Howard: We’re just saying all the things we love about each other."
"8","Raj: Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy."
"8","Leonard: Oh, what’d you get?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I was going to put you in."
"8","Penny: Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back."
"8","Sheldon: I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”"
"8","Leonard: That’s funny. Boy, I’m gonna miss these painkillers."
"8","Penny: Hey, why did you get two? I’m with stupid."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, that one’s mine."
"8","Series 08 Episode 10 – The Champagne Reflection"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: Hello. I’m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?"
"8","Amy: I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?"
"8","Sheldon: But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend."
"8","Amy: And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board."
"8","Sheldon: So as they say, all good things must come to an end."
"8","Amy: After only 232 episodes."
"8","Sheldon: 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on."
"8","Amy: You said you weren’t gonna bring that up."
"8","Sheldon: And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?"
"8","Amy: That was a good one."
"8","Sheldon: It was so good."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: An office at the university."
"8","Raj: You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross."
"8","Howard: Doesn’t Professor Abbott’s family want any of this stuff?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t think he had a family."
"8","Raj: That’s rough."
"8","Leonard: I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box."
"8","Howard: Makes you think. Oh, well."
"8","Leonard: Hey. Hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important."
"8","Howard: I did. It’s all outdated or disproved."
"8","Raj: I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off."
"8","Howard: Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade."
"8","Leonard: It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this."
"8","Howard: Don’t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too."
"8","Leonard: That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it."
"8","Howard: That’s intense."
"8","Raj: Poor Roger Abbott."
"8","Howard: Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit."
"8","Raj: Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he’s dead, but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott."

"8","Dan: Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year."
"8","Penny: Oh, Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine."
"8","Dan: Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep."
"8","Penny: Aw."
"8","Dan: Yes. Why don’t you come over to my table."
"8","Penny: I’ll be right there. Bernadette’s just parking the car."
"8","Dan: Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette."
"8","Penny: Come on. She’s not that bad."
"8","Dan: Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies."
"8","Penny: I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…"
"8","Bernadette: Hey, what are you talking about?"
"8","Penny: Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn’t that right? Dan?"
"8","Sheldon: Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder."
"8","Amy: And, yes, even shed a tear or two."
"8","Sheldon: Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded."
"8","Amy: How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?"
"8","Sheldon: How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights."
"8","Highlight 1"
"8","Sheldon: Crikey, what flag do we have today?"
"8","Amy: Australia, mate."
"8","Highlight 2"
"8","Sheldon: And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag."
"8","Kripke: Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this."
"8","Highlight 3"
"8","Amy: Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?"
"8","Sheldon: I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock."
"8","Amy: Then who did sew it, hmm?"
"8","Sheldon: Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck."
"8","Highlight 4"
"8","Sheldon: Fancy a dip, my dear?"
"8","Amy: I do."
"8","Sheldon: Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present."
"8","Amy: Wow, that flag is a lifesaver."
"8","Sheldon: No. This is. Stop looking at my legs."
"8","Highlight 5"
"8","Kripke: Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap."
"8","Scene: The office."
"8","Raj: When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?"
"8","Howard: Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?"
"8","Raj: Wrong, smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie."
"8","Leonard: Look at these notebooks. They’re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this."
"8","Howard: Mmm. It’s just columns of random numbers. Toss it."
"8","Leonard: Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?"
"8","Raj: Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties."
"8","Leonard: This has to mean something."
"8","Howard: Well, there’s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check."
"8","Leonard: Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer."
"8","Howard: Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants."
"8","Leonard: Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems."
"8","Howard: Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis."
"8","Raj: Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with."
"8","Howard: Oh, let’s do that."
"8","Leonard: Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?"
"8","Howard: Yeah, I’m not even sure if it’s the right word."
"8","Scene: The conference room."
"8","Penny: So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?"
"8","Dan: Seven."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time."
"8","Penny: I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid."
"8","Bernadette: Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.”"
"8","Dan: I need another drink."
"8","Bernadette: What’s his problem?"
"8","Penny: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss."
"8","Bernadette: Well, I didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore."
"8","Penny: Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh."
"8","Bernadette: What? I’m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies."
"8","Penny: Yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, yeah? You one of those people?"
"8","Penny: No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing."
"8","Amy: Action."
"8","Sheldon: Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton."
"8","LeVar Burton: Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal."
"8","Sheldon: You do this, I delete your contact information."
"8","LeVar: While?"
"8","Sheldon: While you watch me do it."
"8","LeVar: Great. Happy to be back."
"8","Sheldon: Well, since you’re here, I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? (On recording) Hi. My name is George."
"8","(On recording)"
"8","LeVar: Oh, hell, no."
"8","Sheldon: You heard him, Leonard. No, it’s not racist."
"8","Scene: An apartment building."
"8","Howard: Are we sure this is the place?"
"8","Raj: The doorman said this is the right building."
"8","Leonard: I think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman. (Knocks)"
"8","(Knocks)"
"8","Man (off): Who is it?"
"8","(off)"
"8","Leonard: Uh, I’ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?"
"8","Prof Sharpe: Hold on. Can I help you?"
"8","Leonard: Hi. We’re from the university. We’re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott."
"8","Howard: We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers."
"8","Leonard: Any chance you know what it is?"
"8","Prof Sharpe: Yes, he was always working on this."
"8","Raj: I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy."
"8","Prof Sharpe: It’s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That’s his food diary."
"8","Leonard: Really?"
"8","Prof Sharpe: Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever."
"8","Raj: Does it work?"
"8","Howard: Seriously?"
"8","Raj: Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know."
"8","Prof Sharpe: Sorry it’s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn’t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years."
"8","Leonard: So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?"
"8","Prof Sharpe: To be honest, his research never amounted to anything."
"8","Raj: You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel."
"8","Raj: Well, you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm."
"8","Bernadette: I’m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody."
"8","Penny: No. That’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper."
"8","Bernadette: I did say that, didn’t I?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them."
"8","Bernadette: Where? To Babies R Us?"
"8","Penny: You’re doing it again."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me."
"8","Penny: Oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are."
"8","Bernadette: I think I’d rather go."
"8","Penny: No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together."
"8","Bernadette: Thank you."
"8","Penny: Even though your dress is ugly."
"8","Scene:The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I’d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show."
"8","Amy: Take that, glass ceiling."
"8","Sheldon: And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn’t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I’m giving it up. Before I sign off, I’d, uh, I’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It’s good for times like this. Good night."
"8","Amy: Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful."
"8","Sheldon: If you didn’t press record…"
"8","Amy: I pressed it."
"8","Leonard: Well, that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott."
"8","Raj: And we still don’t know who framed him."
"8","Leonard: I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing."
"8","Howard: I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life."
"8","Leonard: That’s a nice way of looking at it."
"8","Howard: Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I’m covered."
"8","Leonard: You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let’s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott."
"8","Howard: I love that."
"8","Raj: Yeah, me, too."
"8","Leonard: Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face."
"8","Raj: Oh, well, that’s the best part."
"8","Howard: Oh, yeah."
"8","Bernadette: Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?"
"8","Dan: Sure, go ahead."
"8","Bernadette: Just want you to know I didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson."
"8","Dan: No, it’s okay."
"8","Bernadette: No, it’s not. Penny told me that everyone’s scared of me."
"8","Dan: What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?"
"8","Penny: What?"
"8","Bernadette: No, she’s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I’m gonna be much more sensitive. I don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me."
"8","Dan: Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I’ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee."
"8","Bernadette: No problem. When does that start?"
"8","Dan: Five months ago."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Dan: Yeah."
"8","Bernadette: Who’s been paying for my coffee?"
"8","Dan: All of us."
"8","Penny: Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse."
"8","Bernadette: What else don’t I know about?"
"8","Penny: Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?"
"8","Bernadette: Yeah?"
"8","Penny: That was supposed to be for the whole floor."
"8","Bernadette: You’re kidding."
"8","Dan: No, no. It’s okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she’s back in the hospital now, so it all worked out."
"8","Bernadette: I feel so bad."
"8","Penny: Well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her Wheelchair Kathy."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I’m just a monster."
"8","Dan: But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc."
"8","Bernadette: No, I’m the worst. I’m a terrible person."
"8","Dan: Come on, don’t cry. It’s okay."
"8","Bernadette: It’s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?"
"8","Penny: Because this company needs you."
"8","Dan: It’s fine. We don’t mind paying for the coffee."
"8","Bernadette: I can’t let you do that."
"8","Dan: Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office."
"8","Bernadette: I guess that would be all right."
"8","Penny: See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want."
"8","Bernadette: You’re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?"
"8","Leonard: Hey."
"8","Sheldon: Hello."
"8","Leonard: How come you’re up so late?"
"8","Sheldon: I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing."
"8","Leonard: Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking."
"8","Sheldon: It’s not the same thing. I don’t think you know how I feel at all."
"8","Leonard: Sad?"
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. What did they say?"
"8","Sheldon: Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back."
"8","Leonard: Congratulations."
"8","Sheldon: Let’s celebrate."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, that wasn’t for you."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no, I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary."
"8","Scene: LeVar Burton’s house."
"8","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton?"
"8","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"8","LeVar: Ugh. What are you doing here?"
"8","Sheldon: You told me not to call, and I didn’t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode."
"8","LeVar: Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don’t know why I didn’t get a gate."
"8","Sheldon: You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk"
"8","about German flags. How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?"
"8","Series 08 Episode 11 – The Clean Room Infiltration"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Penny: Hey, how are things going with your parents?"
"8","Raj; Not great. They hired divorce attorneys."
"8","Sheldon: You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk."
"8","Penny: You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon."
"8","Amy: Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?"
"8","Howard: Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York."
"8","Sheldon: Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire."
"8","Raj: Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year."
"8","Amy: If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father."
"8","Raj: That would be nice."
"8","Amy: I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding."
"8","Sheldon: Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going."
"8","Amy: You’re going."
"8","Sheldon: Why do you hate me?"
"8","Amy: I don’t hate you. I love you."
"8","Sheldon: Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it."
"8","Raj: Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving."
"8","Bernadette: I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice."
"8","Howard: I agree."
"8","Leonard: Why not?"
"8","Penny: Me, too."
"8","Raj: You guys suck."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: The University clean room."
"8","Leonard: You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen."
"8","Howard: We should get going to Amy’s."
"8","Leonard: Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses."
"8","Howard: I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty."
"8","Leonard: Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no."
"8","Howard: How the hell did a pigeon get in here?"
"8","Leonard: You shut the loading doors, right?"
"8","Howard: I thought you did."
"8","Leonard: Do you know what a disaster this is?"
"8","Howard: You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?"
"8","Leonard: What do we do? Should we call someone?"
"8","Howard: And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows."
"8","Leonard: Okay, how do we catch it?"
"8","Howard: Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it."
"8","Leonard: It’s not a moth."
"8","Howard: Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling."
"8","Leonard: Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?"
"8","Howard: Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do."
"8","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"8","Penny: So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?"
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Twenty hours."
"8","Penny: Oh, that’s rough."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don’t pray for the plane to crash?"
"8","Raj: Can we please talk about anything else?"
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?"
"8","Penny: Oh, great. Everything’s good."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: I see you got engaged."
"8","Penny: Yes, we did."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Let me tell you a story."
"8","Raj: Dad."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Sorry. I’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other."
"8","Raj (on phone): Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university."
"8","(on phone)"
"8","Amy: What’s going on?"
"8","Raj: There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: You want me to come?"
"8","Raj: Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing."
"8","Penny: You’re just gonna leave him here?"
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Relax, he says."
"8","Raj: Yup. Bye."
"8","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"8","Bernadette (singing): Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins."
"8","(singing)"
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I appreciate the ride."
"8","Bernadette (singing): Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?"
"8","Sheldon: Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him."
"8","Bernadette: Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children."
"8","Sheldon: My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts."
"8","Bernadette: Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something."
"8","Sheldon: Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show."
"8","Bernadette: She’s just excited about the holidays."
"8","Sheldon: Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson."
"8","Bernadette: How?"
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m going to buy her a present."
"8","Bernadette: Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that."
"8","Sheldon: With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible."
"8","Bernadette: Then you’re both sad?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again."
"8","Bernadette: So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?"
"8","Sheldon: That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too."
"8","Scene: The clean room."
"8","Howard: Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up."
"8","Leonard: A Slim Jim?"
"8","Howard: It’s all I could find. It’ll work."
"8","Leonard: Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker."
"8","Howard: Okay, well, what’s your plan?"
"8","Leonard: I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help."
"8","Howard: And admit that we contaminated the clean room?"
"8","Leonard: No, admit that you contaminated the clean room."
"8","Howard: Why do you keep assuming it was me?"
"8","Leonard: Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up."
"8","Howard: Like when?"
"8","Leonard: What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?"
"8","Howard: Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys."
"8","Leonard: Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag."
"8","Howard: Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?"
"8","Leonard: I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it."
"8","Raj: Hey, what’s going on?"
"8","Leonard: Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim."
"8","Raj: Should have put it in the bag first."
"8","Penny: So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?"
"8","Dr Koothrappali: It’s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?"
"8","Penny: No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?"
"8","Amy: Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play."
"8","Penny: Like what?"
"8","Amy: Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off."
"8","Penny: Sorry. She’s taken, too."
"8","Howard: You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along."
"8","Leonard: And you found somebody you could push around?"
"8","Raj: Hey."
"8","Howard: Stay out of this."
"8","Raj: Okay."
"8","Howard: You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me."
"8","Raj: Actually."
"8","Howard: I said, stay out of it."
"8","Leonard: No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say."
"8","Raj: All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard."
"8","Howard: Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out."
"8","Raj: No, you’re the one who let him in."
"8","Howard: How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?"
"8","Raj: Come on."
"8","Scene: A shopping mall."
"8","Bernadette: What about that sweater?"
"8","Sheldon: No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect."
"8","Bernadette: I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me."
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along."
"8","Bernadette: Wow, you really do love her."
"8","Sheldon: I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless."
"8","Amy: You won."
"8","Penny: Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?"
"8","Dr Koothrappali: You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time."
"8","Penny: Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working."
"8","Penny: Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right."
"8","Scene: Santa’s grotto."
"8","Santa: All right, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?"
"8","Sheldon: Correct."
"8","Santa: Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough."
"8","Sheldon: There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure."
"8","Photographer: Smile."
"8","Santa: Ho, ho. ho."
"8","Leonard: Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out."
"8","Howard: Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?"
"8","Leonard: Do you want the fire extinguisher?"
"8","Howard: Yeah, I do."
"8","Leonard: Great. Here you go."
"8","Howard: Okay. One, two, three."
"8","Raj: Uh, you have to take the pin out."
"8","Leonard: You miss the blanket now, don’t you?"
"8","Howard: On three. One, two, three."
"8","Raj: What did you do?"
"8","Howard: It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
"8","Leonard: Relax, it wasn’t your fault."
"8","Howard: Uh, maybe it’s just stunned."
"8","Raj: Dude, it’s not breathing."
"8","Howard: Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again."
"8","Raj: What do you mean, not again?"
"8","Howard: When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious."
"8","Leonard: Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds."
"8","Howard: Great. Do it."
"8","Leonard: I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it."
"8","Raj: I’ll do it."
"8","Howard: No. I need to do it. This is on me."
"8","Leonard: Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions."
"8","Raj: Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit."
"8","Leonard: Anything?"
"8","Howard: I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim."
"8","Leonard: Wait, wait, his wing moved."
"8","Howard: Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive."
"8","Raj: It’s a Christmas miracle."
"8","Howard: I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain."
"8","Raj: Someone should really close that loading door."
"8","Scene: The same, later."
"8","Raj: Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks."
"8","Howard: You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault."
"8","Leonard: No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one."
"8","Raj: Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy."
"8","Leonard (on phone): Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?"
"8","Penny: It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble."
"8","Penny: Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?"
"8","Leonard: No, our names are on the sign-in sheet."
"8","Penny: So erase them and walk out."
"8","Leonard: I can’t do that."
"8","Howard: Can’t do what?"
"8","Leonard: She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave."
"8","Howard: We can’t do that."
"8","Leonard: Yeah."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"8","Leonard, Howard and Raj (singing): Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey."
"8","Raj: Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious."
"8","Sheldon: If you like raisins."
"8","Amy: Thank you. And it’s figs."
"8","Sheldon: Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good."
"8","Bernadette: You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose."
"8","Howard: It smelled too much like blue jay."
"8","Dr Koothrappali: Can I help you clean up?"
"8","Amy: Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good."
"8","Sheldon: Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?"
"8","Penny: Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any."
"8","Leonard: I thought you hate giving gifts."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this."
"8","Amy: You got me something?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it."
"8","Amy: Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet."
"8","Sheldon: Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?"
"8","Amy: No, I love it."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, really? Well, how about now? (On recording) Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. (Not on recording) And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun."
"8","(On recording)"
"8","(Not on recording)"
"8","Amy: Actually, I did get you something."
"8","Sheldon: But what about our agreement?"
"8","Amy: Well, you got me something. Here."
"8","Sheldon: Cookies?"
"8","Amy: They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe."
"8","Sheldon: They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs."
"8","Amy: Merry Christmas, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box."
"8","Amy: Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans."
"8","Penny: Of course it is."
"8","Amy: One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold."
"8","Raj: If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy."
"8","Series 08 Episode 12 – The Space Probe Disintegration"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: What colour would you like to be?"
"8","Leonard: Well, I’d like to be green, but you know you always take it."
"8","Sheldon: That’s not true. Any colour’s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow."
"8","Leonard: Blue and yellow make green."
"8","Sheldon: Well, then it’s settled."
"8","Penny: Hi. Ready to go?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours."
"8","Penny: Sweetie, you really thought I’d want to do this?"
"8","Leonard: No."
"8","Penny: Well, did you tell him that?"
"8","Leonard: Yes."
"8","Penny: Did you say it out loud with words?"
"8","Penny: I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories."
"8","Amy: I will literally race you to the car."
"8","Leonard: No, no, no, come on, don’t leave. Just try it."
"8","Penny: No. We’re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted."
"8","Sheldon: You want to be green?"
"8","Leonard: You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into."
"8","Penny: Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary."
"8","Amy: Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I’m banished to the kitchen."
"8","Penny: Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do."
"8","Leonard: You got it, you girls are in charge."
"8","Penny: Thank you."
"8","Amy: Sheldon?"
"8","Sheldon: Fine. Now that we’re not playing, you can be green."
"8","Leonard: Thank you."
"8","Sheldon: And since you’re green this time, I can be it next time."
"8","Penny: All right, let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding."
"8","Amy: I actually can’t. My hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off."
"8","Penny: All right, well, what do you want to do?"
"8","Amy: There’s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire."
"8","Penny: Well, that’s Wilshire’s problem. Come on, you know, there, there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate."
"8","Leonard: Hang on, why do we have to hate it?"
"8","Penny: Three words, Doctor Who convention."
"8","Leonard: I did not force you to go to that."
"8","Penny: You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn’t get beat up."
"8","Leonard: I wasn’t gonna get beat up."
"8","Penny: You were, but somehow I held myself back."
"8","Sheldon: You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni."
"8","Leonard: Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, I’m a problem-solver, it’s what I do."
"8","Amy: I actually can’t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles."
"8","Penny: Is there any part of your body that’s normal?"
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Raj: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."
"8","Howard: Will you please relax?"
"8","Raj: I can’t take it, dude."
"8","Bernadette: You okay?"
"8","Raj: No, I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin."
"8","Bernadette: I told you not to wax down there. It’s itchy when it grows back."
"8","Raj: I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe."
"8","Bernadette: What’s he talking about?"
"8","Howard: Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on."
"8","Raj: We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived."
"8","Howard: Now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice."
"8","Raj: Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore."
"8","Amy: Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown."
"8","Sheldon: Before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog."
"8","Penny: How come we can’t think of something we both want to do?"
"8","Amy: Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it."
"8","Leonard: Ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy."
"8","Sheldon: You should point out the hypocrisy of that."
"8","Leonard: That’s what I was doing."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, that wasn’t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?"
"8","Penny: All right, keep thinking."
"8","Sheldon: You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?"
"8","Leonard: Well, yeah."
"8","Sheldon: Well, then, it’s settled?"
"8","Amy: What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect."
"8","Penny: It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it."
"8","Sheldon: Well, once again, it’s what I do."
"8","Raj: Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me."
"8","Howard: I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…"
"8","Raj: Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?"
"8","Howard: A story can do two things."
"8","Raj: Ugh, I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack."
"8","Howard: You work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?"
"8","Bernadette: All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack."
"8","Raj: I can’t stop thinking about it."
"8","Bernadette: You know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens."
"8","Raj: I know."
"8","Howard: Maybe you need to do something more productive."
"8","Raj: Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order."
"8","Howard: So, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess."
"8","Raj: Yes."
"8","Howard: The man who crashed his stationary bike."
"8","Raj: I didn’t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this."
"8","Howard: You happy? Now you can relax."
"8","Raj: What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three."
"8","Scene: A clothes shop."
"8","Leonard: This isn’t so bad."
"8","Sheldon: That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that’s a lot of panties."
"8","Amy: You guys comfy? This might take a while."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes."
"8","Penny: No, you’re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston."
"8","Sheldon: They have a man there who understands my personal style."
"8","Penny: Bye."
"8","Leonard: Uh, I’ve got some bad news. There’s no cell service in here."
"8","Sheldon: Oh. Well, that’s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented."
"8","Leonard: That’s true."
"8","Sheldon: I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, it’s fine."
"8","Sheldon: No, it’s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have Wi-Fi? I’m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit."
"8","Scene: The same, later."
"8","Sheldon: Let’s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three."
"8","Leonard: Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win."
"8","Sheldon: Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it. I wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here."
"8","Leonard: I don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It’s the least we can do."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, that’s true. I suppose it’s only fair we make compromises."
"8","Leonard: Look at you, being all mature."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t know why you’re so surprised. If there’s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise."
"8","Leonard: I, I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?"
"8","Sheldon: All the time."
"8","Leonard: On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we’re living?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you."
"8","Leonard: That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me."
"8","Leonard: What? Then. then why don’t you do it?"
"8","Sheldon: Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise."
"8","Scene: Raj’s car."
"8","Raj: Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company."
"8","Howard: I’m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?"
"8","Raj: If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple."
"8","Howard: Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels."
"8","Raj: I meant a Hindu temple."
"8","Howard: Oh. Okay. It’s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out."
"8","Raj: Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians."
"8","Howard: You love that movie."
"8","Raj: Yeah, it’s pretty great."
"8","Howard: I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious."
"8","Raj: Why?"
"8","Howard: Well, because I’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house."
"8","Raj: Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don’t talk about it."
"8","Howard: Yeah, but you’re a scientist."
"8","Raj: So?"
"8","Howard: So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?"
"8","Raj: That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?"
"8","Howard: No. There’s also Apu from The Simpsons."
"8","Raj: Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe."
"8","Howard: Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe."
"8","Raj: Actually there’s no proof of that."
"8","Howard: You believe in your religion, I’ll believe in mine."
"8","Scene: The store changing rooms."
"8","Amy: How’s it going in there?"
"8","Penny: Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?"
"8","Amy: Sure."
"8","Penny: Do I really force you to do things you don’t want to?"
"8","Amy: Yeah, but it’s okay."
"8","Penny: How is it okay?"
"8","Amy: I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I’d do whatever they said. Really, I’m lucky you found me before a cult did."
"8","Penny: Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want."
"8","Amy: Really?"
"8","Penny: Absolutely. You name it, we’re doing it."
"8","Amy: Basket weaving at the craft museum."
"8","Penny: Well, you named it."
"8","Scene: The store."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, here’s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don’t put it there because I don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast."
"8","Leonard: Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?"
"8","Sheldon: I wasn’t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising."
"8","Leonard: Because of you, I’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I’m not allowed to whistle. I don’t wear shoes that might squeak."
"8","Sheldon: Well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you."
"8","Sheldon: Is that true?"
"8","Leonard: Yes, it’s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away."
"8","Sheldon: Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now."
"8","Leonard: You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting."
"8","Sheldon: You know what? You think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, I, I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should."
"8","Leonard: Do you mean that?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life."
"8","Leonard: Come on, don’t get upset."
"8","Sheldon: I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: It’s okay."
"8","Leonard: I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall."
"8","Sheldon: I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me."
"8","Leonard: Buddy."
"8","Penny: How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?"
"8","Leonard: Everything’s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements."
"8","Amy: Are you crazy? You know he’s a flight risk."
"8","Sheldon: That’s exactly what I told him."
"8","Penny: Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready."
"8","Sheldon: Well, what if you did it gradually?"
"8","Leonard: All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?"
"8","Sheldon: How about one night and I let you whistle?"
"8","Leonard: Okay."
"8","Sheldon: When I’m not home."
"8","Leonard: You got it."
"8","Sheldon: There we go, compromising again. We really are the best."
"8","Scene: The temple car park."
"8","Howard: Here we go, my first Hindu temple."
"8","Raj: You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine."
"8","Howard: Huh. I always thought it was mini golf."
"8","Raj: All right. Shall we?"
"8","Howard: Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?"
"8","Raj: Like what?"
"8","Howard: Like am I dressed okay?"
"8","Raj: Really? So every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?"
"8","Howard: I know you’re under a lot of pressure, so I’m gonna let that pass."
"8","Raj: Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us."
"8","Howard: That’s nice."
"8","Raj: Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs."
"8","Howard: Raj."
"8","Raj: You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber."
"8","Howard: Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It’s fine."
"8","Raj: Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa."
"8","Scene: The craft museum."
"8","Leonard: I thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun."
"8","Penny: Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket."
"8","Sheldon: It’s not a basket. It’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century China."
"8","Amy: Very nice."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, it looks great."
"8","Sheldon: I saw that."
"8","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"8","Leonard: Well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start."
"8","Penny: I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, I’m proud of him, too."
"8","Sheldon (in Penny’s living room): Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here."
"8","(in Penny’s living room)"
"8","Series 08 Episode 13 – The Anxiety Optimisation"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Leonard: Okay, we’re headed out, see you later."
"8","Sheldon: Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, sure."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. Go ahead."
"8","Leonard: Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years."
"8","Penny: Uh, Bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada."
"8","Leonard: Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph."
"8","Penny: Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush."
"8","Leonard: Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever."
"8","Sheldon: Aw, now I’m sad I didn’t hear it."
"8","Penny: So what do you need the headphones for?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman."
"8","Penny: Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours."
"8","Penny: Yeah, have fun."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science."
"8","Penny: And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower."
"8","Leonard: Bye."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay."
"8","(Time shift)"
"8","Leonard: Hey, we’re home. Any progress?"
"8","Sheldon: How could there be, with these constant interruptions?"
"8","Penny: I love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Leonard: What are you doing? It’s time to go."
"8","Sheldon: I’m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?"
"8","Leonard: Ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?"
"8","Sheldon: Like a big old baby."
"8","Leonard: Call me if you need anything."
"8","Sheldon: I’ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air."
"8","Penny (off): Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!"
"8","(off)"
"8",""
"8","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?"
"8","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"8","Penny (off): Ugh!"
"8","Penny: Ugh, what?"
"8","Sheldon: You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard."
"8","Penny: Oh, I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it."
"8","Sheldon: Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard."
"8","Penny: I don’t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder."
"8","Sheldon: And to clarify?"
"8","Penny: The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m not going. Would you like to know why?"
"8","Penny: Uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?"
"8","Sheldon: Boy, I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am."
"8","Scene: The cafeteria."
"8","Howard: I invented a game. You want to play?"
"8","Leonard: Sure."
"8","Howard: It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog."
"8","Raj: Go ahead, make fun. You can’t embarrass me, I’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater."
"8","Howard: Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it."
"8","Raj: I may not be liking this game so much."
"8","Leonard: Cinnamon. Give me another one."
"8","Howard: Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters."
"8","Leonard: We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon."
"8","Raj: You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It’s not strange."
"8","Leonard: Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself."
"8","Howard: What do you mean?"
"8","Sheldon: According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I’d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable."
"8","Howard: Hold on. What’s in it for us?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I suppose…"
"8","Howard: Okay, we’ll do it."
"8","Scene: Amy’s laboratory."
"8","Sheldon: Done."
"8","Amy: 33 seconds. Okay, that’ll be our baseline."
"8","Sheldon: You know, I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet."
"8","Amy: It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers."
"8","Sheldon: And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster."
"8","Amy: All right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate."
"8","Sheldon: Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy."
"8","Amy: Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart."
"8","Amy: Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana."
"8","Sheldon: Who eats them horizontally?"
"8","Amy: My mother said that’s how good girls do it."
"8","Sheldon: Perhaps this was a waste of time."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you."
"8","Amy: And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?"
"8","Sheldon: Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…"
"8","Amy: Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone."
"8","Sheldon: Really? Oh, that’s fantastic. Now, wait, they’re dropping. Why are they dropping?"
"8","Amy: Because you’re happy they’re elevated."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down."
"8","Raj: All right, guys, what game do you want to play?"
"8","Howard: Let’s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?"
"8","Raj: You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships."
"8","Howard: Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair."
"8","Leonard: That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them."
"8","Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it."
"8","Leonard: So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes."
"8","Raj: And you think that’s going to help?"
"8","Howard: Well, I don’t think that’s gonna help at all."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I’ll become more focused."
"8","Leonard: Howard’s right, that’ll never work."
"8","Sheldon: Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically valid. I’m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me."
"8","Raj: I don’t think that’s what you want at all."
"8","Sheldon: Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?"
"8","Leonard: Because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said."
"8","Sheldon: I ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it."
"8","Howard: Yes, we can."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, well, then do it."
"8","Howard: Nah."
"8","Sheldon: You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Penny: So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii."
"8","Amy: That would be so romantic for you and Leonard."
"8","Penny: Yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector."
"8","Amy: If I were going to Hawaii, I’d spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?"
"8","Penny: Really? Want to go to Hawaii?"
"8","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies?"
"8","Penny: Come in."
"8","Sheldon: Ladies."
"8","Penny: What’s up?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, as you may know, I’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?"
"8","Penny: What exactly do you think goes on here?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them."
"8","Bernadette: We were talking about Penny’s job."
"8","Sheldon: And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue."
"8","Penny: Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about."
"8","Sheldon: You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?"
"8","Penny: Let’s just talk about our periods."
"8","Amy: No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. They’re a werewolf, that’s only part wolf. It’s like comparing apples to oranges."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye."
"8","Leonard: What is going on?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her."
"8","Leonard: Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I’m trying to sleep. Good night."
"8","Sheldon: Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."
"8","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"8","Amy: You’ve been working so much lately, I’m glad you didn’t forget about date night."
"8","Sheldon: Of course."
"8","Amy: Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah."
"8","Amy: Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me."
"8","Sheldon: I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time."
"8","Amy: Fine. How was your day?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, you said it."
"8","Amy: Sheldon. Sheldon, I’m worried about you. You’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell."
"8","Sheldon: I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety."
"8","Howard: Okay, so it’s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you’re the tiebreaker."
"8","Penny: Say the quote again."
"8","Howard: It’s just so perfect that we’re both Libras."
"8","Penny: Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon."
"8","Howard: Yes."
"8","Penny: Yes."
"8","Raj: Come on."
"8","Howard: That was the last one, I promise. We won’t play any more."
"8","Raj: Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings."
"8","Bernadette: Emily’s feelings?"
"8","Raj: Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?"
"8","Penny: Date night."
"8","Leonard: That can’t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull."
"8","Bernadette: What happened?"
"8","Leonard: He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car."
"8","Bernadette: Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?"
"8","Howard: I don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody."
"8","Leonard: You didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment."
"8","Sheldon: He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay."
"8","Raj: Wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe."
"8","Howard: Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?"
"8","Amy: Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off."
"8","Sheldon: That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah."
"8","Amy: I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night."
"8","Sheldon: There you go, perfect."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, stop it, I’m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away."
"8","Sheldon: But after months of struggling, I’m finally making progress."
"8","Amy: You don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive."
"8","Sheldon: Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo."
"8","Amy: That’s not true."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself."
"8","Sheldon: Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?"
"8","Amy: Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety."
"8","Sheldon: Hmm, perhaps. But I’m not taking the cap off."
"8","Amy: It’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I’m telling you for the last time, take the cap off."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, really? What if I don’t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?"
"8","Scene: A bus."
"8","Sheldon: And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in."
"8","Man: Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?"
"8","Sheldon: I knew you’d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton."
"8","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"8","Penny: Okay."
"8","Leonard: Here we are."
"8","Sheldon: Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn’t in here."
"8","Leonard: You lie down, he’ll be here in a minute."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me."
"8","Penny: Now, you just get comfortable."
"8","Sheldon: No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it’s poster time."
"8","Leonard: Maybe in the morning."
"8","Penny: Yeah, you get some sleep."
"8","Sheldon: No, I don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me."
"8","Penny: You’re right, we can’t."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, darn straight, you can’t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep."
"8","Penny (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty."
"8","(singing)"
"8","Leonard (singing): Little ball of fur."
"8","Sheldon: That’s not gonna work."
"8","Penny (singing): Happy kitty, sleepy kitty."
"8","Together (singing): Purr, purr, purr."
"8","Leonard: You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face."
"8","Penny: Mmmm."
"8","Howard: You look like you got some rest."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I’m feeling much better. And I’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels."
"8","Leonard: I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there."
"8","Raj: Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?"
"8","Howard: Yeah, no problem."
"8","Sheldon: Of course not."
"8","Emily: So I hear you guys have been playing a little game."
"8","Howard: Well, um, we were just kidding around."
"8","Emily: Well, you may think it’s funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it’s sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?"
"8","Series 08 Episode 14 – The Troll Manifestation"
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Penny: So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?"
"8","Leonard: Wow, you remember that?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium."
"8","Leonard: You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table."
"8","Penny: And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?"
"8","Leonard: Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own."
"8","Penny: Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm."
"8","Leonard: Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?"
"8","Penny: No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing."
"8","Leonard: Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…"
"8","Penny: Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving."
"8","Leonard: No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon."
"8","Penny: Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Leonard: Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?"
"8","Sheldon: Hmm."
"8","Leonard: What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?"
"8","Leonard: I know this isn’t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers."
"8","Leonard: No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?"
"8","Sheldon: It’s good."
"8","Leonard: Really?"
"8","Sheldon: I like it. I think you’re on to something."
"8","Leonard: You do? You’re not messing with me?"
"8","Sheldon: Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job."
"8","Leonard: You’re giving me a sticker?"
"8","Sheldon: Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow."
"8","Leonard: I’m not a preschooler."
"8","Sheldon: Fine, I’ll take it back."
"8","Leonard: I earned this. Back off."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Leonard: You’re still awake?"
"8","Sheldon: For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump."
"8","Leonard: You worked out all the math."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper."
"8","Leonard: You wrote a paper on my idea?"
"8","Sheldon: I wrote a paper on our idea."
"8","Leonard: When did my idea become our idea?"
"8","Sheldon: When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind."
"8","Leonard: This is good. Our idea is really good."
"8","Sheldon: Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright."
"8","Leonard: You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal."
"8","Sheldon: Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn’t gonna do it without you."
"8","Leonard: Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?"
"8","Sheldon: We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch."
"8","Leonard: You’re sure it’s good?"
"8","Sheldon: My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon."
"8","Leonard: Okay, partner, let’s do it."
"8","Sheldon: Come on. Click the mouse with me."
"8","Leonard: One, two three."
"8","Together: Click."
"8","Leonard: Well, we did it."
"8","Sheldon: Yes, we did, my friend."
"8","Leonard: Is your tongue blue?"
"8","Sheldon: I don’t want to talk about it."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?"
"8","Amy: Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?"
"8","Penny: Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store."
"8","Bernadette: Search for it."
"8","Penny: What, no, why?"
"8","Bernadette: ‘Cause it would be fun to watch."
"8","Penny: It would be humiliating."
"8","Bernadette: Well, now we have two reasons."
"8","Amy: They have it."
"8","Bernadette: Please, can we watch it?"
"8","Amy: Please?"
"8","Penny: Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible."
"8","Amy: Have you even seen it?"
"8","Penny: No."
"8","Bernadette: Well, maybe it turned out better than you think."
"8","Voice on TV: Bananas, get your fresh bananas."
"8","Bernadette: Ho-ho, it really didn’t."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s laboratory."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off."
"8","Sheldon: Does it smell like blueberries?"
"8","Leonard: No."
"8","Sheldon: Then we’re probably okay."
"8","Howard: Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog."
"8","Leonard: Really? What’d they say?"
"8","Howard: Uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board."
"8","Leonard: Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful."
"8","Leonard: Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?"
"8","Sheldon: I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking."
"8","Howard: How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?"
"8","Raj: Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv."
"8","Sheldon: Read another one."
"8","Leonard: Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."
"8","Sheldon: Who wrote that?"
"8","Leonard: It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’m responding to it."
"8","Leonard: Uh, don’t lower yourself to their level."
"8","Sheldon: Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers."
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this."
"8","Sheldon: He just left another comment."
"8","Raj: What does it say?"
"8","Leonard: Upon review, I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter."
"8","Sheldon: Can I respond now?"
"8","Leonard: Do it."
"8","Sheldon: You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be."
"8","Leonard: Somebody else do it."
"8","Penny (on television): Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla."
"8","(on television)"
"8","Doctor: Why do you think you’re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?"
"8","Penny (on television): Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist."
"8","Penny: Okay, we’ve seen plenty."
"8","Bernadette: No, give me the remote."
"8","Amy: Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off."
"8","Penny: Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more."
"8","Amy: What is it?"
"8","Penny: Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant."
"8","Amy: What?"
"8","Bernadette: Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong."
"8","Amy: I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it."
"8","Bernadette (on screen): Hi. I’m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California."
"8","(on screen)"
"8","Penny: You look like a talking cupcake."
"8","Bernadette (on screen): And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to (singing) tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999."
"8","(singing)"
"8","Amy: Play it again. Play it again."
"8","Raj: Did he respond yet?"
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. No, not yet."
"8","Leonard: Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level."
"8","Howard: It wasn’t that bad."
"8","Leonard: Read it back one more time."
"8","Sheldon: My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother."
"8","Leonard: And you don’t think that’s too rough?"
"8","Sheldon: We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her."
"8","Penny: How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?"
"8","Bernadette: ‘Cause it’s embarrassing."
"8","Penny: It is; it truly is."
"8","Bernadette: Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet."
"8","Amy: Why? What did I do?"
"8","Bernadette: Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training."
"8","Penny: Okay. We are reading that right now."
"8","Amy: No, please don’t."
"8","Bernadette: We got embarrassed tonight. Come on."
"8","Amy: But it’s personal."
"8","Penny: Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?"
"8","Amy: No."
"8","Penny: Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon."
"8","Amy: It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with."
"8","Penny: Please show us?"
"8","Bernadette: Please?"
"8","Penny: You know I’m gonna read it either way."
"8","Amy: Good luck finding it."
"8","Penny: Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different."
"8","Bernadette: Why? Why did it feel different?"
"8","Penny: Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."
"8","Amy: You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I’m starting to miss that."
"8","Sheldon: He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?"
"8","Leonard: Do you really want him to write back?"
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?"
"8","Leonard: Me-wow."
"8","Howard: What are you doing?"
"8","Raj: I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper."
"8","Howard: This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off."
"8","Raj: No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off."
"8","Sheldon: He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?"
"8","Howard: Yes."
"8","Raj: Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating."
"8","Raj: Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those."
"8","Howard: Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka."
"8","Raj: See? Better with the accent."
"8","Sheldon: And send."
"8","Leonard: What did you write?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world."
"8","Leonard: What does that mean?"
"8","Sheldon: I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere."
"8","Leonard: Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that."
"8","Raj: Come on, Sheldon!"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, okay, okay, calm down. (Skype tone) It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world."
"8","(Skype tone) I"
"8","Leonard: Oh, really?"
"8","Penny: “Time travel? I don’t understand,” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”"
"8","Bernadette: Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting."
"8","Amy: He’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It’s called good writing. And wishful thinking."
"8","Penny: It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man."
"8","Bernadette: Here we go."
"8","Penny: Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, Amelia."
"8","Penny: So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state."
"8","Amy: In the 1800s that was considered flirting."
"8","Raj: I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet."
"8","Howard: Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face."
"8","Sheldon: Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face."
"8","Leonard: Never noticed that about you."
"8","Raj: You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work."
"8","Sheldon: He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide."
"8","Leonard: All right, do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished."
"8","Sheldon: Click it with me. One, two, three, click."
"8","Stephen Hawking: Well, hello there."
"8","Sheldon: Professor Hawking?"
"8","Stephen Hawking: Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces."
"8","Leonard: You really didn’t like our paper?"
"8","Stephen Hawking: I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing."
"8","Sheldon: Then why are you attacking us?"
"8","Stephen Hawking: If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you’d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao."
"8","Leonard: Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing."
"8","Sheldon: Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper."
"8","Leonard: And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing."
"8","Howard: How do you do, Mr. I’ll-Admit-That’s-Pretty-Cool?"
"8","Raj: Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure."
"8","Penny: With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed."
"8","Bernadette: Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed."
"8","Amy: Okay, that’s enough."
"8","Penny: What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens."
"8","Amy: You’re just making fun of me."
"8","Bernadette: I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good."
"8","Penny: No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?"
"8","Amy: Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia’s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can’t stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don’t go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life."
"8","Bernadette: But they didn’t even kiss."
"8","Amy: She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper."
"8","Penny: Yes."
"8","Amy: “What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…"
"8","Leonard: You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said."
"8","Penny: Get out!"
"8","Bernadette: Not now!"
"8","Scene: An 1800’s house."
"8","Amelia: Is the water warm enough?"
"8","Cooper: Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it’s a little nippy."
"8","Amelia: I can fix that. I couldn’t help but notice your unusual undergarments."
"8","Cooper: They’re not undergarments. They’re Underoos. Where I come from, they’re known as underwear that’s fun to wear."
"8","Amelia: And what’s the significance of the spider?"
"8","Cooper: Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can."
"8","Amelia: There’s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn’t there?"
"8","Leonard (in bed): You’re right. This is even weirder than I thought."
"8","(in bed)"
"8","Penny: You want me to stop reading?"
"8","Leonard: Are you kidding? No, no."
"8","Penny: As he stood for Amelia to dry him…"
"8","Amelia: So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, okay, I’m good."

"8","Scene: Amy’s laboratory."
"8","Sheldon: I’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?"
"8","Amy: Sure."
"8","Sheldon: How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?"
"8","Amy: How many?"
"8","Sheldon: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke."
"8","Amy: Is that really true?"
"8","Sheldon: Of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs."
"8","Barry: Hey, sowwy to intewupt."
"8","Sheldon: Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?"
"8","Barry: Did you know Edison didn’t actuawy invent the wight bulb?"
"8","Sheldon: What do you want, Barry?"
"8","Barry: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy."
"8","Amy: What’s this for?"
"8","Barry: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper’s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing."
"8","Amy: Well, that’s fascinating. I can’t wait to read it."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken."
"8","Barry: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs."
"8","Sheldon: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?"
"8","Amy: Well, I’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?"
"8","Amy: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs."
"8","Sheldon: That’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, we’re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You’re being petty."
"8","Sheldon: I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?"
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Howard (on phone): Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye."
"8","(on phone)"
"8","Bernadette: Your mom having fun in Florida?"
"8","Howard: Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely."
"8","Bernadette: She’s just being nice."
"8","Howard: Well, I’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if I’m lonely?"
"8","Bernadette: Because you have a wife."
"8","Howard: Yeah, well, sometimes you work late."
"8","Bernadette: I know you don’t like Stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, I’m sure he’ll get back on his feet."
"8","Howard: That would be great. I’d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal."
"8","Bernadette: Well, normal’s a strong word, but sure."
"8","Scene: The laundry room."
"8","Penny: Hey."
"8","Sheldon: Hello."
"8","Penny: You okay?"
"8","Sheldon: If I was okay, I would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello."
"8","Penny: What’s going on?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m mad at Amy."
"8","Penny: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?"
"8","Sheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory."
"8","Penny: Oh, that sounds like a good thing."
"8","Sheldon: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I’m sorry you had to see that."
"8","Penny: I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera."
"8","Sheldon: Why would she do this to me?"
"8","Penny: Well, I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?"
"8","Sheldon: No, I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science."
"8","Penny: All right, well, if I’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I’m thinking you might have to let this one go."
"8","Sheldon: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel."
"8","Penny: I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, why don’t you talk to her?"
"8","Sheldon: Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?"
"8","Penny: Well, you could shove them somewhere."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, now you’re getting creative."
"8","Scene: The comic book store."
"8","Stuart: Thanks again for your help."
"8","Leonard: No problem."
"8","Raj: Our pleasure."
"8","Leonard: The place really looks great."
"8","Raj: Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago."
"8","Stuart: I keep telling you I didn’t burn it down."
"8","Leonard: We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime."
"8","Bernadette: Stuart, this place looks amazing."
"8","Stuart: Thanks."
"8","Howard: You really did a nice job."
"8","Stuart: And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom’s through all this. I couldn’t have done it otherwise."
"8","Howard: I appreciate that, and I’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?"
"8","Stuart: Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn’t it look great?"
"8","Howard: Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs."
"8","Bernadette: Howie."
"8","Howard: Why don’t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water."
"8","Stuart: What is your problem? She said it was okay."
"8","Howard: Well, I’m her son, and I say it’s not okay."
"8","Stuart: Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art."
"8","Howard: Well, maybe I should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother."
"8","Bernadette: Why don’t we leave so you can cool off?"
"8","Stuart: I think that’s a good idea. Take him out of my store."
"8","Howard: Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I’m not going anywhere."
"8","Leonard: Why don’t we go get the food for the party."
"8","Stuart: Thank you."
"8","Raj: Smart, looks like we’re being helpful."
"8","Leonard: Mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Sheldon: Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I’m so… Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?"
"8","Penny: No."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?"
"8","Penny: I don’t know, just think about something else."
"8","Sheldon: Can I think about the spiny anteater?"
"8","Penny: Sure."
"8","Sheldon: The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all."
"8","Penny: You know, some people try visualization."
"8","Sheldon: How does that work?"
"8","Penny: Okay, imagine your problems are a pen."
"8","Sheldon: Okay."
"8","Penny: Now imagine you’re holding that pen."
"8","Penny: Now open your hand and let it go."
"8","Sheldon: But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look."
"8","Penny: Sheldon, this isn’t that hard."
"8","Sheldon: I may have a better way that you can teach me."
"8","Penny: How?"
"8","Sheldon: What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?"
"8","Penny: What? She didn’t give me any puzzles."
"8","Sheldon: Are you sure?"
"8","Amy (in flashback): Boy, I just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?"
"8","(in flashback)"
"8","Amy (in flashback): Darn it. There’s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?"
"8","Amy (in flashback): Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box."
"8","Penny: Son of a bitch."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, that’s great. Now, let it go."
"8","Penny: I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp."
"8","Sheldon: Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way."
"8","Penny: Why would she even do this?"
"8","Sheldon: She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?"
"8","Penny: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?"
"8","Sheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting?"
"8","Penny: It’s not interesting. It’s incredibly insulting."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard."
"8","Penny: Oh, my, that’s it. Get out."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go."
"8","Penny: Get out."
"8","Sheldon: Penny?"
"8","Penny: What?"
"8","Sheldon: I think I left my pen in there."
"8","Bernadette: I understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it’s just furniture."
"8","Howard: It’s my mom’s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art."
"8","Bernadette: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that."
"8","Howard: That is a good point. But I didn’t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I’m being."
"8","Bernadette: This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows."
"8","Scene: A deli."
"8","Leonard: Hi, we’re here to pick up an order for Comic Center."
"8","Waitress: Sure, let me go check on that."
"8","Raj: Dude, I, I think that’s Nathan Fillion."
"8","Leonard: Oh yeah, look at that."
"8","Raj: And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea."
"8","Leonard: We’re not selling his tomatoes on eBay."
"8","Raj: No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store, that would be amazing."
"8","Leonard: That would be great."
"8","Raj: So should we go talk to him?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t know. I mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again."
"8","Raj: What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones."
"8","Leonard: He was a jerk because you rear-ended him."
"8","Raj: I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible."
"8","Nathan Fillion: Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I’m not an actor."
"8","Raj: Don’t say that. I mean, you’re not Dame Judi Dench, but you’re pretty great."
"8","Nathan Fillion: Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I’m Nathan Fillion, but I’m not. So if you don’t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch."
"8","Leonard: Come on. Sorry to bother you."
"8","Raj: Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I’m still floating."
"8","Scene: The hallway."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, it’s me."
"8","Penny: Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate."
"8","Amy: What are you talking about?"
"8","Penny: I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, open the door."
"8","Sheldon: I can’t. I’m naked."
"8","Amy: I just saw you."
"8","Sheldon: Hang on."
"8","Penny: Open the door now."
"8","Amy: Oh, hey."
"8","Penny: Pull up your pants."
"8","Amy: It’s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars."
"8","Penny: I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity."
"8","Amy: So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?"
"8","Scene: The deli."
"8","Leonard: Thank you."
"8","Raj: Thanks."
"8","Leonard: Sorry again."
"8","Nathan Fillion: No problem."
"8","Raj: Are you sure you’re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We’re scientists, not crazy fanboys."
"8","Nathan Fillion: All right, fine. I’m him."
"8","Raj: And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it, you’re not him."
"8","Nathan Fillion: I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let’s take a picture."
"8","Raj: Great."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, thank you."
"8","Nathan Fillion: You bet."
"8","Raj: Wait, hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion, what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?"
"8","Nathan Fillion: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you."
"8","Leonard: That’s it, that’s the line."
"8","Raj: Although, I knew the line, doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion."
"8","Nathan Fillion: Do you want the picture or not?"
"8","Raj: I want a picture with Nathan Fillion."
"8","Nathan: How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?"
"8","Leonard: What do you think?"
"8","Raj: Ah, it’s good enough for Facebook."
"8","Leonard: I can’t believe they did that."
"8","Penny: I know, it’s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box."
"8","Leonard: Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too."
"8","Penny: Unbelievable."
"8","Leonard: And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible."
"8","Penny: Really? You couldn’t get it out?"
"8","Sheldon: Thank you."
"8","Amy: Wow, the store looks great."
"8","Leonard: So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?"
"8","Penny: Eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings."
"8","Amy: That’s not true."
"8","Sheldon: That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps."
"8","Amy: Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall."
"8","Howard: I’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy."
"8","Bernadette: Can you please just let it go?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket."
"8","Howard: Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?"
"8","(On phone)"
"8","Amy: How can I make this up to you?"
"8","Penny: The answer’s in this puzzle box. Let’s see if you can open it."
"8","Stuart: You could have at least warned him about the furniture."
"8","Raj: That’s what I said when we moved it."
"8","Bernadette: You helped him?"
"8","Raj: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own."
"8","Leonard: Hey, you okay?"
"8","Howard: No."
"8","Leonard: What’s wrong?"
"8","Howard: My mom died."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Howard: Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, my God, Howie."
"8","Leonard: I’m so sorry."
"8","Raj: What can we do?"
"8","Howard: I don’t know."
"8","Sheldon: May I say something?"
"8","Leonard: Not right now, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: But I think it would be comforting."
"8","Leonard: Buddy."
"8","Howard: No, it’s okay. What?"
"8","Sheldon: When I lost my own father, I didn’t have any friends to help me through it. You do."
"8","Penny: I really thought he was gonna say let it go."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Raj (on phone): Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they’ve booked a flight. They’re heading to the airport now."
"8","Penny: How’s Howard holding up?"
"8","Raj: He’s hanging in there."
"8","Leonard: How are you doing, Stuart?"
"8","Stuart: Still can’t believe she’s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn’t for her, I, I would have been homeless."
"8","Amy: One of us would have taken you in."
"8","Stuart: Yeah, I don’t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I’m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person."
"8","Raj: Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener."
"8","Penny: Whenever I saw her, she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me."
"8","Amy: She did that to me, too."
"8","Penny: Don’t take this away from me."
"8","Sheldon: I didn’t care for her yelling. But now that I’m not going to hear it again, I’m sad."
"8","Leonard: If you want, I can yell at you later."
"8","Sheldon: It won’t be as good."
"8","Leonard: Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you."
"8","Series 08 Episode 16 – The Intimacy Acceleration"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Amy: I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours."
"8","Leonard: That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging."
"8","Penny: Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story."
"8","Raj: Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy."
"8","Amy: And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis."
"8","Amy: Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night."
"8","Penny: Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?"
"8","Raj: What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that."
"8","Leonard: I’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?"
"8","Penny: Oh, careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…"
"8","Amy: No."
"8","Sheldon: You didn’t even let me finish."
"8","Amy: Forget it."
"8","Sheldon: So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I’m the monster."
"8","Raj: Why don’t you just do the test?"
"8","Sheldon: In the interest of science, I’d be willing to."
"8","Penny: What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes."
"8","Penny: Please, can I do it with him? Please?"
"8","Leonard: I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you’re it."
"8","Raj: Yeah, but what if the experiment works?"
"8","Penny: I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon."
"8","Amy: That’s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart."
"8","Sheldon: Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope."
"8","Leonard: In love yet?"
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: The hallway."
"8","Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons."
"8","Penny: You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, babe, let’s do this."
"8","Raj: You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d, I’d be a little nervous."
"8","Amy: Why?"
"8","Raj: Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?"
"8","Amy: I think we’re safe."
"8","Raj: Well, that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate."
"8","Leonard: Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?"
"8","Amy: The two of us could do it."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, sure, that might be fun."
"8","Amy: What’s the first question?"
"8","Raj: Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
"8","Leonard: Hmm. I can honestly say Penny."
"8","Amy: Oh, then I choose a janitor, ’cause I’m about to throw up."
"8","Leonard: I’m in love. Let’s do something else."
"8","Raj: Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?"
"8","Leonard: Okay."
"8","Amy: Sounds good."
"8","Leonard: Should we call Howard and Bernadette?"
"8","Raj: I don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text."
"8","Amy: Did he say anything about the funeral?"
"8","Raj: Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place."
"8","Scene: An airport baggage desk."
"8","Howard: Are you kidding me? You lost my mother’s ashes?"
"8","Baggage Clerk: No, I’m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted."
"8","Howard: All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,"
"8","first, I meant first."
"8","Clerk: I just need some information. Uh, what’s the flight number?"
"8","Bernadette: Eight sixteen."
"8","Howard: I really did mean first."
"8","Bernadette: Just drop it."
"8","Clerk: And can you describe the bag?"
"8","Bernadette: Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle."
"8","Howard: The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Sheldon: You ready to begin?"
"8","Penny: Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine."
"8","Sheldon: Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery."
"8","Penny: What heavy machinery? Let’s just start."
"8","Sheldon: Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…"
"8","Penny: Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. Living or dead?"
"8","Penny: Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living."
"8","Sheldon: Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself."
"8","Penny: You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?"
"8","Penny: Robert Downey, Jr."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert."
"8","Scene: Raj’s car."
"8","Raj: So, what do you guys want to do?"
"8","Amy: Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick."
"8","Emily: Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?"
"8","Leonard: What’s that?"
"8","Emily: Um, it’s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There’s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie."
"8","Raj: Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now."
"8","Sheldon: What would constitute a perfect day for you?"
"8","Penny: Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing."
"8","Sheldon: That’s it?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, why?"
"8","Sheldon: You didn’t mention Leonard."
"8","Penny: He’s there."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing."
"8","Penny: Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?"
"8","Sheldon: Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race."
"8","Penny: Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy."
"8","Sheldon: Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?"
"8","Scene: An escape room."
"8","Woman in lab coat: You’re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?"
"8","Leonard: Ladies?"
"8","Emily: Are you being polite or scared?"
"8","Leonard: Yup."
"8","Emily: Ah, what a room!"
"8","Amy: Oh."
"8","Leonard: This is cool."
"8","Amy: So, how do we start?"
"8","Emily: We have to look for the clues hidden around the room."
"8","Raj: Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?"
"8","Zombie: Uuuuuuuh!"
"8","Raj: Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear."
"8","Scene: The Baggage Claim."
"8","Clerk: Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles."
"8","Bernadette: So, where is it?"
"8","Clerk: I don’t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?"
"8","Howard: So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?"
"8","Clerk: I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could’ve gotten on an international flight."
"8","Howard: Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth."
"8","Clerk: I’m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento."
"8","Sheldon: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?"
"8","Penny: Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t think you’re taking this seriously."
"8","Penny: Come on, I’m just having some fun with you."
"8","Sheldon: I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability."
"8","Penny: Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys."
"8","Sheldon: Ha. Keep dreaming."
"8","Penny: Sheldon."
"8","Shedon: I’m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that’s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people’s minds."
"8","Penny: Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing."
"8","Sheldon: When are we going to get robot eyes?"
"8","Penny: You’re all alike."
"8","Sheldon: Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful."
"8","Penny: Really? You always seem so confident."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler."
"8","Penny: Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you."
"8","Penny: Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you."
"8","Sheldon: You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?"
"8","Penny: And the wave is gone."
"8","Scene: The escape room."
"8","Zombie: Brains!"
"8","Amy: Keep it down, we’re working here."
"8","Raj: Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded."
"8","Emily: How’s it going with the globe?"
"8","Amy: We used the coordinates to locate the cities."
"8","Leonard: I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe."
"8","Zombie: Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!"
"8","Leonard: Yup. Got the code."
"8","Zombie: Just saying, no refund for finish early!"
"8","Scene: The baggage check."
"8","Bernadette: Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us."
"8","Howard: No, I’m not leaving without her."
"8","Bernadette: All right, we’ll wait."
"8","Howard: I could’ve driven her."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Howard: The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy."
"8","Bernadette: There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?"
"8","Clerk: Yes?"
"8","Bernadette: You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman."
"8","Leonard: Which book are we looking for?"
"8","Raj: Uh, Origin of Species."
"8","Leonard: Here it is. There’s a black light."
"8","Emily: Oh, hang on."
"8","Raj: Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down."
"8","Amy: Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son."
"8","Emily: Ooh. There’s a picture of the sun over there."
"8","Leonard: I bet the key’s behind it."
"8","Zombie: Could be somewhere else."
"8","Emily: Oh, got the key."
"8","Amy: So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?"
"8","Leonard: We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?"
"8","Raj: It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away."
"8","Emily: Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better."
"8","Amy: Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees."
"8","Zombie: Remember that before you post on Yelp."
"8","Penny: If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?"
"8","Sheldon: So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday."
"8","Penny: Today’s your birthday?"
"8","Penny: Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut."
"8","Penny: So, why did you finally tell me?"
"8","Sheldon: The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other."
"8","Penny: Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone."
"8","Penny: That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces."
"8","Sheldon: You’re making it difficult to love you right now."
"8","Clerk: Great news, your bag was returned."
"8","Howard: Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, thank you so much."
"8","Howard: Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom."
"8","Sheldon: That’s it. We’re done with the questions."
"8","Penny: All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go."
"8","Penny: You ready?"
"8","Penny: And begin. This is kind of creepy."
"8","Sheldon: We’re not supposed to talk during this part."
"8","Penny: Sorry."
"8","Sheldon: This is kind of creepy."
"8","Penny: Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact."
"8","Sheldon: Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with."
"8","Penny: Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too."
"8","Sheldon: Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup."
"8","Penny: I meant more like a little brother."
"8","Sheldon: Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother."
"8","Penny: It’s getting creepy again."
"8","Sheldon: What?"
"8","Penny: Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard."
"8","Sheldon: It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food."
"8","Penny: Can you believe it’s been eight years?"
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, and you’re still eating our food."
"8","Penny: I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life."
"8","Sheldon: I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food."
"8","Penny: That’s it. That wasn’t so bad."
"8","Sheldon: No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences."
"8","Penny: Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you."
"8","Sheldon: And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make."
"8","Penny: Like what?"
"8","Sheldon: Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?"
"8","Sheldon: Thank you for walking me home."
"8","Penny: I just want to make sure you get there safe."
"8","Sheldon: Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening."
"8","Penny: It really has."
"8","All: SURPRISE!"
"8","Sheldon: Aah! And after I let you be Gary."
"8","Series 08 Episode 17 – The Colonization Application"
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Leonard: I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone."
"8","Penny: Again, it was miniature golf."
"8","Leonard: Admit it, you’re a little turned on."
"8","Penny: You can’t be this proud."
"8","Leonard: Why not?"
"8","Penny: Because I beat you."
"8","Leonard: Hey."
"8","Penny: Hi."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, good. You’re back."
"8","Amy: We have some exciting news."
"8","Leonard: Okay."
"8","Sheldon: As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible."
"8","Penny: Okay."
"8","Amy: After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward."
"8","Sheldon: Do you want to say it?"
"8","Amy: Let’s say it together."
"8","Together: We’re getting a turtle."
"8","Penny: This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice."
"8","Sheldon: Sarcasm?"
"8","Amy: Yes."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business."
"8","Leonard: Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you."
"8","Penny: Yes."
"8","Amy: Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us."
"8","Sheldon: No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile."
"8","Leonard: Why a turtle?"
"8","Sheldon: After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise."
"8","Amy: For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate."
"8","Leonard: Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?"
"8","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"8","Amy: That’s what I said."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Emily’s apartment."
"8","Raj: So, where’s your roommate tonight?"
"8","Emily: Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her."
"8","Raj: But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding."
"8","Emily: And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient."
"8","Raj: That’s okay. I can come back later."
"8","Emily: No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here."
"8","Raj: Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward."
"8","Emily: Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs."
"8","Raj: Oh, good."
"8","Emily: Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper."
"8","Scene: A pet store."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord."
"8","Amy: It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine."
"8","Sheldon: That was a lot of puppies."
"8","Amy: Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?"
"8","Amy: Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead."
"8","Sheldon: I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house."
"8","Amy: But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work."
"8","Sheldon: Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars."
"8","Amy: What are you talking about?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian."
"8","Amy: You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?"
"8","Sheldon: Would you have approved?"
"8","Amy: Of course not."
"8","Sheldon: Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Leonard: Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make."
"8","Penny: Aw, is this your first time?"
"8","Leonard: No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you."
"8","Penny: Well, why?"
"8","Leonard: Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store."
"8","Penny: You went to the dirty store without me?"
"8","Leonard: In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away."
"8","Penny: Well, get it. Get it for me."
"8","Leonard: Yeah?"
"8","Penny: Yeah."
"8","Leonard: Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic."
"8","Penny: Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?"
"8","Leonard: No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing."
"8","Penny: Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off."
"8","Leonard: You’re making fun of me. Forget it."
"8","Penny: No. No, come on, I want to do it."
"8","Leonard: Really?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you."
"8","Leonard: Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"8","Howard: How are the taxes going?"
"8","Bernadette: Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here."
"8","Howard: Those are business expenses. You can write those off."
"8","Bernadette: A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?"
"8","Howard: Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. (On phone) Hey, what’s up?"
"8","(On phone)"
"8","Raj: Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?"
"8","Howard: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes."
"8","Raj: What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?"
"8","Howard: She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans."
"8","Raj: So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap."
"8","Howard: What’s wrong?"
"8","Raj: I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close."
"8","Howard: So?"
"8","Raj: She’s gonna know I was looking in it."
"8","Howard: Why were you looking in it?"
"8","Raj: Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back."
"8","Howard: Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there."
"8","Raj: Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no."
"8","Howard: You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go."
"8","Raj: Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping."
"8","Bernadette: What’s happening?"
"8","Howard: Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one."
"8","Bernadette: Aw. I’m gonna miss her."
"8","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"8","Penny: So what do you think?"
"8","Leonard: I thought it’d be a little more, just more."
"8","Penny: I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?"
"8","Leonard: Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad."
"8","Penny: Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this."
"8","Leonard: Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?"
"8","Penny: Almost 1am."
"8","Leonard: Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do."
"8","Penny: Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this."
"8","Sheldon: I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home."
"8","Amy: No one told you to poke the turtle’s face."
"8","Sheldon: I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you."
"8","Amy: I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get."
"8","Sheldon: Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever."
"8","Sheldon: So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?"
"8","Amy: I would at least mention it before filling out the application."
"8","Sheldon: Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said."
"8","Amy: And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite."
"8","Sheldon: First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application."
"8","Amy: You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?"
"8","Amy: No. Forget it."
"8","Sheldon: What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?"
"8","Amy: Please don’t."
"8","Sheldon: Yep, you’re mad."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Howard is on the phone to Raj."
"8","Howard: Okay, let me see the damage."
"8","Raj: Hang on."
"8","Howard: Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it."
"8","Raj: With what?"
"8","Howard: Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?"
"8","Raj: She does."
"8","Howard: Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer."
"8","Raj: Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?"
"8","Sheldon: I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint."
"8","Amy: Why do you even want to do this?"
"8","Sheldon: Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?"
"8","Amy: Can’t you just tell me?"
"8","Sheldon: But I made a video."
"8","Sheldon (on video): I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?"
"8","(on video)"
"8","Leonard (on video): You mean this weirdly suspicious one?"
"8","(on video):"
"8","Sheldon (on video): Yes. Open it and check."
"8","Leonard (on video): I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars."
"8","Sheldon (on video): But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars."
"8","Sheldon: Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out."
"8","Scene: Penny’s bathroom."
"8","Leonard: Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it."
"8","Penny: How did you get paint in your eye?"
"8","Leonard: Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles."
"8","Scene: Emily’s bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard."
"8","Raj: This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know."
"8","Howard: It’s fine. You just need two more nails."
"8","Raj: Okay, where should I put them?"
"8","Howard: In Emily’s eyes."
"8","Raj: You’re not helping."
"8","Bernadette: Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping."
"8","Raj: You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…"
"8","Emily: Raj? I’m back."
"8","Raj: Oh, no. Hey."
"8","Emily: Hi."
"8","Raj: How was the hospital?"
"8","Emily: Fine. What were you doing in there?"
"8","Raj: Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand."
"8","Emily: You were looking in my night stand?"
"8","Raj: Yeah."
"8","Emily: So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?"
"8","Raj: You’ve never snooped around my apartment?"
"8","Emily: No."
"8","Raj: Come on, think back. It would really help if you had."
"8","Emily: I can’t believe you don’t trust me."
"8","Bernadette: She sounds really mad."
"8","Howard: We should hang up."
"8","Bernadette: Yeah, we should."
"8","Howard: But we’re not going to, are we?"
"8","Bernadette: Not a chance."
"8","Howard: What happened to snooping is wrong?"
"8","Bernadette: Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?"
"8","Leonard: Well, we did it."
"8","Penny: We sure did."
"8","Leonard: I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete."
"8","Penny: Sweetie, I beat you at this, too."
"8","Leonard: So, where do we want to hang it?"
"8","Penny: What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it."
"8","Leonard: But it’s an expression of our love."
"8","Penny: And our butts. Not hanging it."
"8","Leonard: Seems a shame to throw it away."
"8","Penny: Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it."
"8","Leonard: God, I love you. I love you so much."
"8","Amy: I think I’m gonna go home."
"8","Sheldon: Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here."
"8","Amy: You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something."
"8","Sheldon: Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too."
"8","Amy: Sure. Unless something better comes along."
"8","Sheldon: Do you want me to withdraw my application?"
"8","Amy: What I want is for us to be planning our future together."
"8","Sheldon: And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work."
"8","Amy: We’re on the same planet."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?"
"8","Amy: Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?"
"8","Sheldon: I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?"
"8","Amy: Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?"
"8","Amy: You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars."
"8","Sheldon: You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?"
"8","Amy: Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians."
"8","Sheldon: They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?"
"8","Amy: I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple."
"8","Sheldon: Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face."
"8","Scene: Emily’s bedroom."
"8","Raj: Thank you for forgiving me."
"8","Emily: That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight."
"8","Raj: Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself."
"8","Emily: Can I ask you one thing?"
"8","Raj: Of course. What?"
"8","Emily: Did you look in my closet?"
"8","Raj: No. Just the drawer."
"8","Emily: You promise you didn’t look in the closet?"
"8","Raj: I promise. Why, what’s in there?"
"8","Emily: Don’t worry about it. Good night."
"8","Series 08 Episode 18 – The Leftover Thermalization"
"8","Scene: The lobby."
"8","Sheldon: Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places."
"8","Amy: I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote."
"8","Amy: Oh, let me see."
"8","Sheldon: I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all."
"8","Sheldon: Well, that can’t be right."
"8","Amy: It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?"
"8","Sheldon: All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards."
"8","Amy: Poor Leonard."
"8","Sheldon: Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled."
"8","Amy: He might not be."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump."
"8","Amy: Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I’d be incensed."
"8","Amy: So you see what I’m getting at?"
"8","Sheldon: Squeaky wheel gets the grease?"
"8","Amy: No."
"8","Sheldon: Grass is always greener?"
"8","Amy: Try again."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me."
"8","Amy: Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad."
"8","Sheldon: But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article."
"8","Amy: Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard."
"8","Amy: Exactly."
"8","Sheldon: For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Howard’s car."
"8","Howard: Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff."
"8","Raj: Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing."
"8","Bernadette: Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go."
"8","Howard: Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories."
"8","Bernadette: Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?"
"8","Howard: Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah."
"8","Sheldon: Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that."
"8","Leonard: Actually, your name is on the electric bill."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, right. This is a disaster."
"8","Leonard: I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it."
"8","Leonard: What’s going on?"
"8","Sheldon: An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory."
"8","Leonard: Did they hate it?"
"8","Sheldon: No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it."
"8","Leonard: So what’s the problem?"
"8","Sheldon: You know how the PennySaver only has my name…"
"8","Leonard: Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me."
"8","Leonard: Really?"
"8","Sheldon: I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight."
"8","Leonard: Uh, that, that’s not necessary."
"8","Sheldon: It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse."
"8","Leonard: Cooper and his team?"
"8","Sheldon: You should know I had nothing to do with that."
"8","Leonard: Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important."
"8","Sheldon: You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits."
"8","Leonard: That’s not helping."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable."
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s House."
"8","Howard: Stuart, we’re here."
"8","Raj: It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house."
"8","Howard: Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him."
"8","Stuart: Hey. Just so you know, the power’s out."
"8","Bernadette: What happened?"
"8","Stuart: I called, they said a transformer blew. It’s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow."
"8","Howard: Wait, when did it go out?"
"8","Stuart: In the middle of the night."
"8","Howard: Oh, my God."
"8","Bernadette: Howie, what’s wrong?"
"8","Howard: It’s all defrosting."
"8","Bernadette: It’s okay. It’s just food."
"8","Howard: It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one."
"8","Raj: Everything okay?"
"8","Howard: No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined."
"8","Bernadette: Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?"
"8","Raj: You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science."
"8","Bernadette: What should we do?"
"8","Howard: I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it."
"8","Bernadette: There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there."
"8","Howard: All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first."
"8","Bernadette: Howie."
"8","Howard: Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time."
"8","Bernadette: I love that."
"8","Raj: Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Penny: I mean, who even reads Scientific American?"
"8","Leonard: It’s kind of a big deal."
"8","Penny: If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?"
"8","Leonard: Can we please just stop talking about it?"
"8","Penny: I’m sorry. What can I do?"
"8","Leonard: Nothing, I’m fine."
"8","Penny: No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go."
"8","Leonard: What are we doing?"
"8","Penny: I am taking you shopping."
"8","Leonard: Oh."
"8","Penny: My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again."
"8","Leonard: Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing."
"8","Penny: Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?"
"8","Leonard: Does it have a camera in it?"
"8","Penny: It does have a camera in it."
"8","Leonard: Baby’s listening."
"8","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?"
"8","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"8","Leonard: What?"
"8","Sheldon: I spoke to the reporter at the magazine."
"8","Leonard: What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?"
"8","Sheldon: I did."
"8","Leonard: Thank you. What did he say?"
"8","Sheldon: He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist."
"8","Leonard: Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea."
"8","Penny: You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it."
"8","Penny: You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?"
"8","Leonard: If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working."
"8","Sheldon: Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?"
"8","Leonard: No."
"8","Sheldon: Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are."
"8","Scene: Amy’s car."
"8","Sheldon: All he had was an idea."
"8","Amy: Well, that is an important part."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out."
"8","Amy: But Leonard’s idea was good."
"8","Sheldon: Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side."
"8","Scene: Penny’s car."
"8","Leonard: I’m the one who thought of it."
"8","Penny: Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything."
"8","Penny: And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter."
"8","Sheldon: Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?"
"8","Amy: It’s not your fault."
"8","Sheldon: Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?"
"8","Amy: Not your fault."
"8","Sheldon: Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?"
"8","Amy: Hey, look at that pretty bird."
"8","Leonard: He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby."
"8","Penny: I know, I know."
"8","Leonard: I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter."
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s kitchen."
"8","Raj: Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up."
"8","Bernadette: Thanks."
"8","Howard: Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah."
"8","Bernadette: Did she throw anything away?"
"8","Howard: No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself."
"8","Raj: Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna."
"8","Howard: No, that’s noodle kugel."
"8","Raj: One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup."
"8","Howard: Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking."
"8","Bernadette: You okay?"
"8","Howard: Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started."
"8","Raj: You got it."
"8","Howard: I’m never gonna talk to her again."
"8","Bernadette: Should we tell everyone not to come?"
"8","Howard: No. I want to do this."
"8","Bernadette: Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can."
"8","Howard: Okay."
"8","Raj: I’m not making any promises."
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s living room."
"8","Stuart: Glad you guys could make it."
"8","Leonard: Of course."
"8","Penny: Wow, it looks really pretty in here."
"8","Stuart: Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood."
"8","Leonard: So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?"
"8","Stuart: And there goes the mood."
"8","Sheldon: Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name."
"8","Leonard: Subtle."
"8","Sheldon: But you got it, right?"
"8","Howard: Hey, guys."
"8","All: Hey. Hi. Hello."
"8","Howard: I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion."
"8","Bernadette: Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before."
"8","Howard: Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death."
"8","Amy: Do you need any help in the kitchen?"
"8","Bernadette: No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable."
"8","Penny: All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?"
"8","Amy: Yes, so please behave yourselves."
"8","Leonard: Fine."
"8","Sheldon: Of course."
"8","Stuart: So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?"
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s dining room."
"8","Penny: This food is amazing."
"8","Raj: Mm, and not a vegetable in sight."
"8","Howard: That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here."
"8","Amy: All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon."
"8","Sheldon: Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day."
"8","Penny: Oh, so it’s like The View."
"8","Amy: Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I’m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek…"
"8","Penny: Shut up."
"8","Raj: I would like to propose a salon topic."
"8","Amy: Ooh, please do, Rajesh."
"8","Raj: The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female."
"8","Penny: Wait, who’s Tor?"
"8","Raj: You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?"
"8","Howard: Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now."
"8","Stuart: It’s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet."
"8","Amy: We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work."
"8","Howard: I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor."
"8","Penny: Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution."
"8","Leonard: Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?"
"8","Bernadette: Oh, that’s fine."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned."
"8","Amy: Sheldon."
"8","Penny: Guys."
"8","Leonard: No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?"
"8","Howard: Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real."
"8","Sheldon: Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said."
"8","Leonard: Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, please. His mother just died."
"8","Leonard: You’re being ridiculous."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, so are you."
"8","Penny: Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did."
"8","Leonard: Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas."
"8","Amy: And girls."
"8","Sheldon: Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest."
"8","Leonard: So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?"
"8","Sheldon: I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it."
"8","Leonard: You want some of this? I’ll give you some."
"8","Bernadette: Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!"
"8","Sheldon: She said my name first, that must kill you."
"8","Bernadette (off): I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…"
"8","(off)"
"8","Howard: You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?"
"8","Amy: I don’t hear it."
"8","Raj: No, not at all."
"8","Penny: I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life."
"8","Howard: It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off."
"8","Sheldon: You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…"
"8","Ra: So glad you two are done fighting."
"8","Leonard: Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up."
"8","Sheldon: Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper."
"8","Stuart: What’d they say?"
"8","Amy: Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?"
"8","Sheldon: They did."
"8","All: Yay."
"8","Bernadette: Good news, I found more Tums."
"8","Series 08 Episode 19 – The Skywalker Incursion"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, I’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley."
"8","Leonard: Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I’ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences."
"8","Penny: You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon."
"8","Amy: Are you all set for your trip?"
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK."
"8","Penny: PRK?"
"8","Leonard: Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell."
"8","Leonard: Keep going."
"8","Sheldon: And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let’s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo."
"8","Penny: You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?"
"8","Amy: Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?"
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"8","Sheldon: Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can’t Spy? It’s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum."
"8","Leonard: If it’s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I’m in."
"8","Sheldon: I’ll begin. Uh, I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us."
"8","Leonard: That soy Frappuccino I had."
"8","Sheldon: Will you please play the game? I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us."
"8","Leonard: I don’t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?"
"8","Sheldon: I don’t want to play anymore."
"8","Leonard: We haven’t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun."
"8","Sheldon: We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging."
"8","Leonard: No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That’s pretty cool."
"8","Sheldon: I suppose it is. In fact, if you’d like to celebrate with a little music, I’d be okay with that."
"8","Leonard: What? This road trip just got crazy."
"8","Sheldon: Play that funky music, white boy."
"8","Leonard: I’m surprised you know that reference."
"8","Sheldon: What reference?"
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"8","Bernadette: So, I put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway."
"8","Amy: Can I be in charge of pricing? I’ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?"
"8","Howard: All right, Amy’s in charge of pricing and being 75."
"8","Raj: Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?"
"8","Penny: Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time."
"8","Raj: Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong."
"8","Penny: Oh, I meant beer pong."
"8","Amy: I had a table, too, but I didn’t have any friends, so all I did was serve."
"8","Bernadette: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it."
"8","Amy: And if I had a friend, they might have told me that."
"8","Howard: Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It’s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house."
"8","Bernadette: I think you just answered your own question."
"8","Howard: Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it."
"8","Bernadette: Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don’t need to decide this right now."
"8","Howard: Well, I guess as long as you’re keeping an open mind."
"8","Bernadette: Of course."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s car. “Play that funky music, white boy” is playing on the stereo."
"8","Sheldon: So they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?"
"8","Leonard: Yes."
"8","Sheldon: And this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?"
"8","Leonard: Sure."
"8","Sheldon: Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?"
"8","Leonard: It could be."
"8","Sheldon: So it’s like the musical equivalent of Russell’s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?"
"8","Leonard: Exactly."
"8","Sheldon: Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun."
"8","Leonard: Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early."
"8","Sheldon: Will our hotel room be ready?"
"8","Leonard: I doubt it."
"8","Sheldon: Aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?"
"8","Leonard: If we do, we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?"
"8","Sheldon: Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won’t be very far from Skywalker Ranch."
"8","Leonard: Oh, that’s true. It’s not like we can get in there."
"8","Sheldon: Why not?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in."
"8","Sheldon: Yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That’s code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in."
"8","Leonard: We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it."
"8","Sheldon: Yes. Oh, I’m so excited. And I just can’t hide it."
"8","Leonard: I’m about to lose control, and I think I like it."
"8","Sheldon: What are you talking about?"
"8","Penny: So when do you guys think you’re gonna move in?"
"8","Howard: We’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do."
"8","Bernadette: It’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest."
"8","Amy: Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty."
"8","Howard: We’re not selling it, it’s mine."
"8","Bernadette: You can’t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?"
"8","Howard: That’s not fair. It’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest."
"8","Raj: You could play Ping-Pong for it."
"8","Howard: I would do that."
"8","Bernadette: How is that fair? You grew up with a table."
"8","Howard: Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods."
"8","Penny: Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs."
"8","Bernadette: Yes, Penny plays for me."
"8","Howard: That’s not fair, she has upper body muscles."
"8","Raj: Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion."
"8","Howard: That’s right, okay, Raj can play for me."
"8","Amy: Ooh, you just chose champions. It’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat."
"8","Penny: Yeah, it’s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones."
"8","Bernadette: Leonard makes you watch that, too?"
"8","Penny: No, no, I like that show. It’s got dragons and people doing it."
"8","Howard: So it’s settled. The fate of Doctor Who’s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers."
"8","Amy: If you still have that bra, I’ll give you a nickel for it."
"8","Sheldon: There it is. It’s just a gate. On a road."
"8","Leonard: Wasn’t even that hard to find."
"8","Sheldon: This is so amazing."
"8","Leonard: I know. You want to get a picture?"
"8","Sheldon: I want more than a picture. I want to go in."
"8","Leonard: Well, so do I, but they’ll never let us."
"8","Sheldon: Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?"
"8","Leonard: No, but I don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me."
"8","Sheldon: There’s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let’s see what happens."
"8","Leonard: Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I’m a little nervous."
"8","Sheldon: Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations."
"8","Leonard: Right."
"8","Sheldon: You pushed it, are you out of your mind?"
"8","Voice: May I help you?"
"8","Leonard: Um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in."
"8","Sheldon: You’re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him."
"8","Voice: Hello? This speaker’s not working, just pull up."
"8","Leonard: And that’s how it’s done."
"8","Scene: The same, further inside the ranch."
"8","Sheldon: All right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate."
"8","Leonard: We’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda."
"8","Sheldon: I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what’s the plan?"
"8","Leonard: Uh, I’m just gonna be honest with the guy."
"8","Sheldon: Honesty will never get us in."
"8","Leonard: Well, what’s your plan?"
"8","Sheldon: All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed."
"8","Security Guard: Who are you here to see?"
"8","Leonard: Uh, I’m just gonna tell you the truth."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, you are killing me."
"8","Leonard: We don’t have an appointment. We, we’re just fans of Mr. Lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."
"8","Security Guard: Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can’t let you in."
"8","Sheldon: What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend."
"8","Leonard: I’m sorry, don’t listen to him. We’re actually physicists. We’re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill."
"8","Security Guard: Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can’t let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you."
"8","Leonard: Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best… What are you doing?"
"8","Sheldon: Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man."
"8","Security Guard: Don’t move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23."
"8","Voice: Copy."
"8","Sheldon: I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. I’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I’m gonna make it. I’m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… Aaaaaaagh!"
"8","Howard: Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, ’cause I don’t have a third one. Yes. Woo."
"8","Amy: Rajesh eight, Penny four."
"8","Penny: Sorry, he’s really good."
"8","Bernadette: Hey, Raj. if Howard can’t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?"
"8","Raj: What?"
"8","Howard: Yeah, what?"
"8","Bernadette: I don’t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don’t know much about<i> Doctor Who."
"8","Howard: Don’t listen to her. You and I go way back, we’re like brothers."
"8","Raj: We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother."
"8","Amy: Eight-five."
"8","Howard: This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?"
"8","Amy: Uh, it, it’s been a long time. I don’t know. I’m probably pretty rusty."
"8","Penny: Wow."
"8","Howard: She’s my champion."
"8","Bernadette: Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj."
"8","Penny: Hey."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, come on, like you even care."
"8","Penny: I care. Oh, wait, no, I don’t. Good luck, Raj."
"8","Howard: You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you."
"8","Raj: So did I."
"8","Scene: An office in Skywalker Ranch."
"8","Sheldon: Do you think they’re gonna call the police?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t know. Maybe they’ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I think that’s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…"
"8","Leonard: Oh, shut up."
"8","Nerdy Guy: He’s right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police."
"8"," "
"8","Leonard: Uh-huh, I’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too."
"8","Sheldon: So, what are you in for?"
"8","Nerdy Guy: Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong."
"8","Sheldon: But why are you here?"
"8","Nerdy Guy: Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue."
"8","Sheldon: Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery."
"8","Security Guard: All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we’re gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges."
"8","Leonard: We understand. Thank you so much."
"8","Nerdy Guy: Uh, what about me?"
"8","Security Guard: No, you’re not going anywhere, kissy face. Let’s go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate."
"8","Sheldon: Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are."
"8","Howard: Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I’ve since turned mean, and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on."
"8","Bernadette: Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn’t that right, Raj?"
"8","Raj: Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good."
"8","Bernadette: Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating."
"8","Raj: Okay, uh, I’m gonna own you, bitch."
"8","Penny: Whoa."
"8","Bernadette: Hey."
"8","Amy: That’s not nice."
"8","Raj: Let’s just play."
"8","Howard: One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?"
"8","Bernadette: Don’t listen to him, all she’s got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away."
"8","Raj: What, and that’s not offensive? Where’s the line?"
"8","Penny: It’s in your purse. Play."
"8","Bernadette: One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five."
"8","Howard: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five."
"8","Bernadette: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten."
"8","Amy: Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds."
"8","Howard: It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over."
"8","Bernadette: You know, Amy, I, uh, can’t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place."
"8","Howard: Don’t listen to her, just hit the ball."
"8","Amy: Keep talking."
"8","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"8","Bernadette: If this doesn’t get him into your bedroom, nothing will."
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Sheldon: Are you still mad at me?"
"8","Leonard: Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee."
"8","Sheldon: Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty."
"8","Leonard: The glass is empty, Sheldon. It’s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?"
"8","Sheldon: Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you’re looking at this all wrong."
"8","Leonard: Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it."
"8","Sheldon: Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser."
"8","Leonard: That part was pretty good."
"8","Sheldon: See?"
"8","Leonard: You did flop around a lot."
"8","Sheldon: I’ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate."
"8","Leonard: You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I’m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant."
"8","Sheldon: That’s amazing."
"8","Leonard: I know."
"8","Sheldon: And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?"
"8","Leonard: I guess this could count as an adventure."
"8","Sheldon: It was. And even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing."
"8","Scene: Amy’s bedroom."
"8","Sheldon: Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind."
"8","Amy: Really should have thought this through."
"8","Series 08 Episode 20 – The Fortification Implementation"
"8","Scene: The cafeteria."
"8","Raj: You’re wrong."
"8","Howard: No, I’m not."
"8","Raj: Yes, you are."
"8","Howard: No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?"
"8","Leonard: Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif."
"8","Raj: The guy who invented it says it’s jif."
"8","Howard: I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated."
"8","Howard: Something happened different from the way you wanted it."
"8","Sheldon: I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included."
"8","Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist."
"8","Howard: Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass."
"8","Sheldon: You’re just saying that to make me feel better."
"8","Leonard: Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this."
"8","Sheldon: Agreed."
"8","Leonard: I was gonna say or, but why bother?"
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"8","Bernadette: Hey, Raj."
"8","Raj: Hey, I got you a little gift."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies."
"8","Raj: You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?"
"8","Howard: Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is."
"8","Raj: Wow, so you’re not curious at all?"
"8","Howard: Nope."
"8","Raj: Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Wil Wheaton: Thanks again for agreeing to do this."
"8","Penny: Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before."
"8","Leonard: Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden."
"8","Penny: Those are Star Trek people."
"8","Leonard: Yes."
"8","Penny: I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them."
"8","Wil: I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here."
"8","Penny: Sorry."
"8","Wil: Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we’re gonna take some calls, we’ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun."
"8","Leonard: This is exciting."
"8","Penny: Yeah, so, how many people listen?"
"8","Wil: Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live."
"8","Penny: What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?"
"8","Wil: Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Amy: Can you please pass the salt?"
"8","Sheldon: Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do."
"8","Amy: Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?"
"8","Sheldon: I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?"
"8","Amy: No, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night."
"8","Amy: According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night."
"8","Sheldon: You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff."
"8","Amy: Well, it applies to you, too."
"8","Sheldon: I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant."
"8","Raj: So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?"
"8","Bernadette: You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures."
"8","Raj: You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit."
"8","Howard: Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball."
"8","Howard (answering door): Can I help you?"
"8","(answering door)"
"8","Guy at door: Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?"
"8","Howard: Yes."
"8","Guy: Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house."
"8","Howard: Wuh, uh, who’s your father?"
"8","Guy: Sam Wolowitz."
"8","Howard: Sam Wolowitz is my father."
"8","Guy: I know."
"8","Howard: Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?"
"8","Guy: I think so."
"8","Howard: Bernadette, weird things are happening out here."
"8","Penny: I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill."
"8","Wil: Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills."
"8","Leonard: Psst."
"8","Wil: I’ve just been handed a note. I’m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice."
"8","Leonard: I, I didn’t want to interrupt."
"8","Wil: Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny’s fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don’t you grab some headphones and join us?"
"8","Leonard: Really?"
"8","Wil: Yeah."
"8","Leonard: Hey, great."
"8","Wil: So, while Leonard gets set up, let’s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2."
"8","Caller: I don’t have a question. I just want to say I’m a big fan of the movie. I’ve seen it, like, ten times."
"8","Penny: Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you."
"8","Wil: Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following."
"8","Penny: Really?"
"8","Wil: Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character."
"8","Leonard: Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj."
"8","Wil: All right, it’s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith."
"8","Kevn: Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it’s been, like, two minutes and you haven’t even brought up Stand By Me."
"8","Penny: Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you."
"8","Leonard: It really is."
"8","Kevin: Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie."
"8","Penny: Oh, wow. I wish it was better."
"8","Wil: Oh, don’t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin’s films?"
"8","Kevin: You’re cruisin’ for a beatin’, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it."
"8","Penny: Aw."
"8","Wil: You know, I’m in the movie, too."
"8","Kevin: Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you’re not in more stuff, man? I’d cast you in a minute."
"8","Penny: Seriously?"
"8","Kevin: Oh, yeah, man. I’m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I’ve ever done before. It’s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part."
"8","Penny: Oh, my, I would love that."
"8","Leonard: You have a new job."
"8","Penny: Well, maybe I can do both."
"8","Leonard: I don’t think you can do both."
"8","Penny: I don’t think I asked you."
"8","Kevin: Yeah, you tell him, Penny."
"8","Leonard: Stay out of it, Kevin Smith."
"8","Sheldon: Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?"
"8","Amy: Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities."
"8","Sheldon: You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb."
"8","Amy: Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do."
"8","Sheldon: Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself."
"8","Amy: When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees."
"8","Sheldon: I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that."
"8","Amy: And at the same time, not."
"8","Sheldon: It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much."
"8","Amy: You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort."
"8","Sheldon: Isn’t that a little juvenile?"
"8","Amy: More juvenile than this?"
"8","Sheldon: I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun."
"8","Howard: You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, let me do it, Howard."
"8","Howard: No, I got it."
"8","Bernadette: So, Josh, what do you do?"
"8","Josh: I’m studying oceanography down in San Diego."
"8","Bernadette: Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo."
"8","Raj: Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?"
"8","Josh: Why would I lie?"
"8","Raj: Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?"
"8","Josh: No."
"8","Raj: A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?"
"8","Raj: You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo."
"8","Bernadette: Why don’t you help with the coffee?"
"8","Raj: Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?"
"8","Howard: Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?"
"8","Raj: I get it. What do you want to do?"
"8","Howard: I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this."
"8","Raj: All right, I’ve got your back."
"8","Howard: Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy."
"8","Josh: I can’t believe my brother’s an astronaut. That’s amazing. What was it like?"
"8","Raj: Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road."
"8","Howard: Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question."
"8","Wil: So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star…"
"8","Leonard: No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation."
"8","Wil: All right. We’re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn’t believe women should have dreams."
"8","Leonard: Give me back that juice."
"8","Penny: What is the harm if I audition?"
"8","Leonard: Well, what if you get it?"
"8","Penny: I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life."
"8","Leonard: From a Kevin Smith movie?"
"8","Kevin: Oh, I’m hanging up now."
"8","Wil: Don’t you listen to him, buddy. You’re awesome. You’re one of the greatest directors of our time."
"8","Kevin: I don’t have a part for you, Wheaton."
"8","Wil: And that was Kevin Smith."
"8","Penny: Thanks a lot."
"8","Leonard: I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?"
"8","Penny: Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?"
"8","Leonard: I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money."
"8","Penny: Decent? I make twice what you make."
"8","Leonard: Wait, twice?"
"8","Penny: Yeah."
"8","Leonard: Like, times two twice?"
"8","Wil: For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let’s listen."
"8","Leonard: I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans."
"8","Penny: Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out."
"8","Leonard: Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?"
"8","Wil: For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no."
"8","Scene: The apartment. Including fort."
"8","Amy: How’s it going, Sheldon?"
"8","Sheldon: Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights."
"8","Amy: Can I come in?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket."
"8","Amy: Amazing."
"8","Sheldon: I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face."
"8","Amy: What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor."
"8","Sheldon: Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels."
"8","Howard: I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?"
"8","Josh: Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going."
"8","Bernadette: Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?"
"8","Josh: Sorry, I have a long drive."
"8","Howard: Well, I hope I get to see you again."
"8","Josh: I hope so, too. I’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with."
"8","Bernadette: Keep dreaming."
"8","Howard: Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game."
"8","Josh: Wow."
"8","Bernadette: He did it with a robot."
"8","Josh: You had sex with a robot?"
"8","Howard: That’s not what she meant."
"8","Raj: But technically, yes."
"8","Leonard: Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?"
"8","Penny: In a safe place."
"8","Leonard: What does that mean, under your bed?"
"8","Penny: No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks."
"8","Leonard: Wait a minute, you have a guy?"
"8","Penny: Don’t you have a guy?"
"8","Leonard: Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money."
"8","Penny: Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money."
"8","Wil: For those of you listening at home, how great is this?"
"8","Leonard: Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off."
"8","Wil: Sure. And we’re back."
"8","Penny: Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again."
"8","Leonard: Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature."
"8","Penny: Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?"
"8","Leonard: That would be great, thank you."
"8","Wil: I’m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you’re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?"
"8","Leonard: Yes, it is, Wil."
"8","Josh: So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?"
"8","Howard: It was actually just a mechanical hand."
"8","Josh: ‘Cause that’s all you need, right?"
"8","Howard: You are my brother."
"8","Scene: The fort."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket."
"8","Amy: I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold."
"8","Sheldon: Mm-hmm."
"8","Amy: And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over."
"8","Sheldon: Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner."
"8","Amy: We both know this one’s gonna win."
"8","Sheldon: Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library."
"8","Amy: Come on, I’ll help you take this down."
"8","Sheldon: Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?"
"8","Amy: Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover."
"8","Sheldon: That’s a big step."
"8","Amy: It’s a big fort."
"8","Sheldon: Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover."
"8","Amy: PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers."
"8","Sheldon: G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers."
"8","Amy: You got yourself a sleepover."
"8","Sheldon: Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?"
"8","Amy: Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?"
"8","Sheldon: It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?"
"8","Amy: Who says this is the only one I hid?"
"8","Leonard: Hello? What is this?"
"8","Sheldon: We built a fort."
"8","Leonard: Are those my sheets?"
"8","Amy: Yes, they are."
"8","Leonard: Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep."
"8","Sheldon: Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, I’m good."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in."
"8","Leonard: Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?"
"8","Sheldon: I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here."
"8","Leonard: Thank you."
"8","Amy: Okay, have a seat on the floor."
"8","Sheldon: Not there. That’s my spot."
"8","Series 08 Episode 21 – The Communication Deterioration"
"8","Scene: The cafeteria."
"8","Sheldon: Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?"
"8","Howard: Sure."
"8","Leonard: Really?"
"8","Howard: Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it."
"8","Sheldon: There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…"
"8","Leonard: Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it."
"8","Sheldon: Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts."
"8","Leonard: That’s pretty cool, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it."
"8","Raj: Hey."
"8","Leonard: Hey."
"8","Howard: Hey."
"8","Sheldon: Hello."
"8","Raj: You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah."
"8","Raj: Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life."
"8","Leonard: Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot."
"8","Sheldon: All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien."
"8","Raj: Anyway, I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system."
"8","Sheldon: Excellent."
"8","Howard: Good for you."
"8","Leonard: Congratulations."
"8","Raj: And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it."
"8","Leonard: Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?"
"8","Sheldon: I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm."
"8","Howard: Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities."
"8","Sheldon: Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic."
"8","Howard: Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?"
"8","Raj: Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team."
"8","Leonard: My mommy raised a gentleman."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"8","Raj: Hey. Thanks for coming by."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. I’m excited to help."
"8","Raj: I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around."
"8","Leonard: I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict."
"8","Raj: You should have told him to mind his own business."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda."
"8","Raj: What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?"
"8","Leonard: Mmm, they’re alpha males."
"8","Raj: Huh, what does that make us?"
"8","Leonard: We could be betas. They’re second in charge."
"8","Raj: Okay, that sounds good."
"8","Leonard: Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas."
"8","Raj: Okay, that sounds like us."
"8","Leonard: Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?"
"8","Raj: I don’t know. How do you want to start?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?"
"8","Raj: No. We can do this by ourselves."
"8","Leonard: Okay. Great. How do you want to start?"
"8","Scene: The hallway."
"8","Penny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon."
"8","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"8","Sheldon: I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it."
"8","Penny: Yeah, I kind of want to do it again."
"8","Sheldon: I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali."
"8","Penny: Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you."
"8","Sheldon: How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags."
"8","Penny: No, no. It’s about my acting career."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list."
"8","Penny: Well."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy."
"8","Penny: Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up."
"8","Sheldon: Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you."
"8","Penny: Well, why?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people."
"8","Penny: You’re really not gonna tell me?"
"8","Sheldon: No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"8","Bernadette: What’s going on in here?"
"8","Howard: I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan."
"8","Bernadette: Oh. How do you drink it?"
"8","Howard: Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit."
"8","Bernadette: I think I’ll have a beer."
"8","Howard: First take a picture with me."
"8","Bernadette: Why?"
"8","Howard: Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese."
"8","Bernadette: Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?"
"8","Howard: You betcha. The very one."
"8","Bernadette: Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together."
"8","Howard: I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you."
"8","Bernadette: Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings."
"8","Howard: With my honeybunch."
"8","Bernadette: You’re being childish."
"8","Howard: No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that."
"8","Bernadette: I’m sorry. What do we know?"
"8","Howard: In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge."
"8","Bernadette: Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?"
"8","Howard: You don’t think I’m a leader?"
"8","Bernadette: I was kidding. Of course you are."
"8","Howard: Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to."
"8","Bernadette: You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?"
"8","Howard: All by myself."
"8","Bernadette: There’s my big boss man."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Sheldon: So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder."
"8","Penny: Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question."
"8","Sheldon: Mmm."
"8","Penny: If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?"
"8","Sheldon: Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?"
"8","Penny: No."
"8","Sheldon: All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information."
"8","Penny: Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man."
"8","Sheldon: Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?"
"8","Penny: Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks."
"8","Sheldon: No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man."
"8","Penny: I’m sorry. What was I thinking?"
"8","Sheldon: Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?"
"8","Penny: ‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it."
"8","Sheldon: Ah, it’s just like he’s here."
"8","Raj: Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized."
"8","Leonard: Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player."
"8","Raj: Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver."
"8","Leonard: That would be more helpful if E.T. were real."
"8","Raj: Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die."
"8","Leonard: My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him."
"8","Raj: And he’s all white."
"8","Leonard: They zip him up in that bag."
"8","Raj: And Gertie can’t stop crying."
"8","Leonard: The flower dies."
"8","Raj: Okay, let’s talk about something else."
"8","Leonard: All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple."
"8","Raj: And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it."
"8","Leonard: It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us."
"8","Raj: Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers."
"8","Leonard: That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent."
"8","Raj: Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different."
"8","Raj: Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well."
"8","Leonard: The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch."
"8","Raj: Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium."
"8","Leonard: All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system."
"8","Raj: We, we can totally do that."
"8","Leonard: I know."
"8","Raj: This is great."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, you know what else it is?"
"8","Raj: What?"
"8","Howard: Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said."
"8","Raj: Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers."
"8","Sheldon (singing): It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus."
"8","(singing)"
"8","Howard: Hang on. Not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?"
"8","Sheldon: You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar."
"8","Howard: Hello."
"8","Raj: Look, I know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project."
"8","Howard: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?"
"8","Sheldon: I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark."
"8","Leonard: We want you back on the project with us."
"8","Sheldon: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?"
"8","Raj: Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help."
"8","Howard: I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that."
"8","Raj: It wasn’t, so are you in?"
"8","Sheldon: Certainly."
"8","Leonard: Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it."
"8","Sheldon: Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj."
"8","Raj: Okay, I think we should do it right now."
"8","Sheldon: Tonight works better for me."
"8","Raj: Okay."
"8","Scene: A hallway."
"8","Penny (voiceover): Okay, it’s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it’s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? (Out loud) I’m starting to remember."
"8","(voiceover)"
"8","(Out loud)"
"8","Raj: So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it."
"8","Sheldon: Uh, building on that, we should order dinner."
"8","Leonard: How is that building on what he just said?"
"8","Howard: Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese."
"8","Raj: Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said."
"8","Sheldon: Building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado."
"8","Leonard: Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant."
"8","Howard: I saw the menu. They have soy cheese."
"8","Sheldon: Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out."
"8","Leonard: It’s not Simon Says."
"8","Raj: Yeah, you’re missing the point, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?"
"8","Scene: The audition room."
"8","Girl: Penny?"
"8","Penny: Oh, hey."
"8","Girl: Hey. I haven’t seen you auditioning in a while."
"8","Penny: Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep."
"8","Girl: You quit acting?"
"8","Penny: Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect."
"8","Second Girl: I heard you can make good money doing that."
"8","Penny: Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes."
"8","First Girl: Really?"
"8","Penny: Mmm."
"8","First Girl: ‘Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat."
"8","Audiitoner: Chelsea?"
"8","First Girl: Wish me luck."
"8","Second Girl: They’re gonna love you. I heard she’s pushing 40 and everything’s fake."
"8","Penny: Yeah. I started that rumour."
"8","Leonard: Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be."
"8","Raj: Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like."
"8","Howard: The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are."
"8","Leonard: Squeeze yourself."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency."
"8","Raj: Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger."
"8","Howard: You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous."
"8","Raj: Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?"
"8","Sheldon: Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard."
"8","Raj: Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over."
"8","Howard: It’s not always."
"8","Leonard: What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt."
"8","Sheldon: We looked great."
"8","Leonard: You let a guy sit on me."
"8","Howard: He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture."
"8","Leonard: I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside."
"8","Raj: Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard."
"8","Howard: You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing."
"8","Howard: Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience."
"8","Leonard: Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us."
"8","Sheldon: I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?"
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge."
"8","Sheldon: Leonard, who’s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?"
"8","Raj: He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge."
"8","Sheldon: No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?"
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Penny: I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things."
"8","Amy: I can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie."
"8","Penny: I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out."
"8","Bernadette: Well, I’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job."
"8","Penny: I do, and you know, I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it."
"8","Bernadette: Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard."
"8","Penny: Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life."
"8","Bernadette: You’re welcome. Hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner."
"8","Penny: Sure."
"8","Amy: And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her."
"8","Penny: Okay."
"8","Bernadette: How about now?"
"8","Penny: All right."
"8","Bernadette: Don’t forget your wallet."
"8","Penny: I, uh, huh."
"8","Scene: An alien spacecraft."
"8","Sheldon (on screen): Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can’t miss it."
"8","(on screen)"
"8","First Alien: That soft pink alien looks delicious."
"8","Second Alien: I could eat."

"8","Scene: The apartment"
"8","Raj: It’s, like, the best one they make, I just can’t get it to work."
"8","Howard: I’ll figure it out."
"8","Raj: It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying."
"8","Howard: Nice. Where were you when I was single?"
"8","Leonard: Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?"
"8","Penny: Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes."
"8","Sheldon: If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed."
"8","Amy: Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?"
"8","Leonard: Nope. It’s pretty exciting."
"8","Sheldon: Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?"
"8","Leonard: How would I be blinded?"
"8","Sheldon: At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye."
"8","Leonard: I’ll take my chances."
"8","Sheldon: Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille."
"8","Raj: Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?"
"8","Howard: Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?"
"8","Raj: I don’t know. Why do I own one?"
"8","Amy: I think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with Penny."
"8","Leonard: Mm, I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me."
"8","Bernadette: Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist."
"8","Amy: With a beautiful girl on your arm."
"8","Sheldon: And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball."
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Scene: The hallway."
"8","Leonard: How’d you get ready so fast?"
"8","Penny: Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt."
"8","Leonard: Why did you need a belt?"
"8","Penny: It’s called an evening look. I’ve never been to New Jersey before."
"8","Leonard: It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives."
"8","Penny: So it’s not really like that?"
"8","Leonard: No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around."
"8","Penny: You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?"
"8","Leonard: Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I’m not doing that either. (Receives text) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled."
"8","(Receives text)"
"8","Penny: What?"
"8","Leonard: Yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the East Coast."
"8","Penny: Well, can we get on another airline?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t think so."
"8","Penny: So, that’s it? We’re not going?"
"8","Leonard: I guess not."
"8","Penny: Well, that sucks."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too."
"8","Penny: Oh. You could tell it to me."
"8","Leonard: Oh, thank you, but I’m okay."
"8","Penny: Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni."
"8","Leonard: Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders."
"8","Penny: Ooh."
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Howard: Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. We should be getting an image."
"8","Sheldon: All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad."
"8","Howard: Maybe we should recalibrate it."
"8","Sheldon: All right."
"8","Howard: Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times."
"8","Sheldon: It actually says at least?"
"8","Howard: Yeah."
"8","Sheldon: Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?"
"8","Howard: Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: You see where I’m going with this."
"8","Howard: Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow."
"8","Sheldon: All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter."
"8","Howard: Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green."
"8","Sheldon: Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?"
"8","Howard: It means the calibration failed. We have to start over."
"8","Sheldon: Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter."
"8","Scene: Raj’s apartment. Skype tone plays."
"8","Raj: Mm. Hello, Daddy. What’s up?"
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: Not much, just wanted to see how my son’s doing."
"8","Raj: Very well, thank you."
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: Are you still dating that dermatologist?"
"8","Raj: If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask."
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: Oh, and there’s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month’s rent on a toy helicopter?!"
"8","Raj: Oh, you’re where that bill goes."
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: I’m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It’s time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance."
"8","Raj: No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week."
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you’re on your own."
"8","Raj: But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…"
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: I’m cutting you off."
"8","Raj: Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?"
"8","Howard: No red and yellow, no red and yellow."
"8","Sheldon: Yay."
"8","Howard: It’s green."
"8","Sheldon: We did it. Oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it."
"8","Howard: Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no."
"8","Howard: Oh. All right, playtime’s over. Let’s open this baby up."
"8","Sheldon: Won’t that void the warranty?"
"8","Howard: Sheldon, I have a master’s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run."
"8","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"8","Penny: Hi."
"8","Leonard: Hey, where’d you go?"
"8","Penny: I got you a little something to cheer you up."
"8","Leonard: Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?"
"8","Penny: Just open it."
"8","Leonard: A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?"
"8","Penny: Because you are giving your commencement speech."
"8","Leonard: What are you talking about?"
"8","Penny: I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype."
"8","Leonard: Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you."
"8","Penny: Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short."
"8","Leonard: Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse."
"8","Penny: Yeah."
"8","Howard: Boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces."
"8","Sheldon: You know what they all do, right?"
"8","Howard: Yes, of course."
"8","Sheldon: What about this one?"
"8","Howard: Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?"
"8","Sheldon: Not very."
"8","Howard: That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit."
"8","Sheldon: So, can you get it working?"
"8","Howard: I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I’ve built components for the space station."
"8","Sheldon: I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work."
"8","Howard: It worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet."
"8","Raj: Hey, guys."
"8","Howard: Hey."
"8","Sheldon: Hello."
"8","Raj: I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon."
"8","Raj: I don’t freaking believe this."
"8","Howard: Relax, it’ll be fine."
"8","Raj: No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it."
"8","Sheldon: You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty."
"8","Raj: What?"
"8","Sheldon: I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while."
"8","Raj: Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this."
"8","Howard: Calm down."
"8","Raj: Okay. Okay, you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. (On phone) Hello, Mummy."
"8","(On phone)"
"8","Mrs Koothrapalli: Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise."
"8","Raj: Well, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?"
"8","Mrs Koothrapalli: Such a sweet boy for asking. Can’t believe you come from the poison seed of your father."
"8","Raj: Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life."
"8","Mrs Koothrapalli: What does that mean, active social life?"
"8","Raj: Well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you."
"8","Mrs Koothrapalli: Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?"
"8","Raj: All I know, Mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy."
"8","Mrs Koothrapalli: Well, however much money your father was giving you, I’ll give you more."
"8","Raj: Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody."
"8","Penny: What’s taking so long?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t think this is gonna work."
"8","Penny: Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown."
"8","Leonard: A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you."
"8","Penny: Oh. Well, you do."
"8","Leonard: Thank you."
"8","Penny: Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs."
"8","Leonard: Well, I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing."
"8","Penny: Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice."
"8","Leonard: Oh. Done and done."
"8","Howard: Okay, I think I’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip."
"8","Sheldon: Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore."
"8","Howard: One toy at a time."
"8","Sheldon: Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados."
"8","Raj: What’s the first one?"
"8","Howard: Suicide."
"8","Sheldon: Wrong. Obesity."
"8","Bernadette: I have the tool you wanted."
"8","Howard: Thank you."
"8","Raj: You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter."
"8","Howard: It’s not about the money. It’s about solving a problem. It’s why I became an engineer. It’s what I like to do, it’s what I’m trained to do. It’s who I am."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could."
"8","Bernadette: Why don’t you just call tech support?"
"8","Sheldon: Whoa."
"8","Raj: Not cool."
"8","Bernadette: What?"
"8","Howard: There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support."
"8","Bernadette: I call tech support all the time."
"8","Howard: Ha-ha."
"8","Sheldon: You call tech support."
"8","Raj: What a baby."
"8","Scene: Leonard’s old school."
"8","Headmaster: And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
"8","Leonard (on screen): Members of the faculty, students, I’m excited to speak to you today. I can’t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it."
"8","(on screen)"
"8","Penny: Oh. Hello. I, I didn’t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don’t do drugs and stay in school."
"8","Leonard: They’re graduating."
"8","Penny: Okay, bye."
"8","Howard: All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we’re back in business. Let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?"
"8","Sheldon: Check."
"8","Howard: GPS?"
"8","Raj: Check."
"8","Howard: Battery charged?"
"8","Bernadette: Four hours of our lives gone? Check."
"8","Howard: All right. All systems go. In five…"
"8","Together: Four, three, two, one."
"8","Sheldon: That’s what my train used to do."
"8","Bernadette: Ready to call tech support?"
"8","Howard: Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual I have. (Raj’s phone rings)"
"8","(Raj’s phone rings)"
"8","Raj: It’s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy."
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: What did you say to your mother?"
"8","Raj: Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay."
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I’m some sort of playboy."
"8","Raj: Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you."
"8","Dr Koothrapalli: You think you take after me?"
"8","Raj: Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model. (Re-entering apartment) Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?"
"8","(Re-entering apartment)"
"8","Leonard (on screen): It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I’m boring myself. Sorry, I can’t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but I didn’t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don’t have any friends. And guess what? That’s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don’t know what they were doing ’cause I was never there."
"8","Penny: I’ll, I’ll tell you later."
"8","Leonard: My point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations."
"8","Tech Support Voice: Your call is important to us. All our technicians are busy helping other customers. Please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly."
"8","Howard: What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to."
"8","Sheldon: It is awful, isn’t it? Listen to that noise."
"8","Howard: Hang on, hang on. It’s working. I did it."
"8","Raj: How’d you do that?"
"8","Howard: No idea, but I did it."
"8","Bernadette: Maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside."
"8","Howard: Well, I’m not flying it."
"8","Sheldon: Then who is?"
"8","Howard: I don’t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else."
"8","Sheldon: Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera’s working. Oh, look, it’s me."
"8","Tech Support Guy: Tech Support, can I help you?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes, it’s a robot uprising. Call the police."
"8","Leonard: So you really think they liked it?"
"8","Penny: Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I…"
"8","Sheldon: Don’t worry, everyone in here is safe."
"8","Series 08 Episode 23 – The Maternal Combustion"
"8","Scene: The apartment."
"8","Penny: Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning."
"8","Penny: Don’t you want to know for sure?"
"8","Leonard: No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force."
"8","Amy: It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award."
"8","Sheldon: Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?"
"8","Penny: Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it."
"8","Amy: Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals."
"8","Sheldon: You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day."
"8","Amy: He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years."
"8","Penny: You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me."
"8","Leonard: If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you."
"8","Penny: Really? It didn’t work for you."
"8","Amy: Do you think the moms will get along?"
"8","Leonard: Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different."
"8","Sheldon: Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?"
"8","Credits sequence."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, thank you, Mother."
"8","Mrs Cooper: I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense."
"8","Sheldon: What did they feed the lions, Mother?"
"8","Mrs Cooper: The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course."
"8","Sheldon: Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?"
"8","Mrs Cooper: Are you ashamed of me?"
"8","Sheldon: Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow."
"8","Scene: The stairwell."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?"
"8","Leonard: No, we’re kind of taking it slow."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: I see."
"8","Leonard: What does that mean?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: You’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there’s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?"
"8","Leonard: Yes, Mother."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Only satisfactory. I see."
"8","Leonard: I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex."
"8","Leonard: See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Why? Are you attracted to her, too?"
"8","Leonard: Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Leonard, I’m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life."
"8","Leonard: Thank you."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Where is she from again?"
"8","Leonard: East Texas."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Ugh."
"8","Leonard: Hey, look who’s here."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, thank you."
"8","Leonard: We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Of course I did, but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval."
"8","Leonard: That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem."
"8","Sheldon: Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: : So nice to meet you."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Very pleasant. And yours?"
"8","Mrs Cooper: Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: You’re kidding, right?"
"8","Leonard: Subtle, mom, real subtle."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"8","Bernadette: Stuart."
"8","Stuart: Morning."
"8","Bernadette: We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants."
"8","Howard: Hey."
"8","Mrs Cooper: You must be very proud of your son."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court."
"8","Mrs Cooper: He did?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he’s terrific."
"8","Sheldon: Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?"
"8","Leonard: You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Calm down, dear. Mary, I’m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?"
"8","Sheldon: Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed."
"8","Sheldon: Ooh, this is a good one."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free."
"8","Sheldon: Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends."
"8","Sheldon: But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends."
"8","Mrs Cooper: No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Sounds like Sheldon was a handful."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Oh, he was a handful."
"8","Sheldon: I was a handful."
"8","Leonard: You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner."
"8","Howard: I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be."
"8","Raj: We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while."
"8","Stuart: Clearly, you’ve never seen me try to talk to a woman."
"8","Bernadette: Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank."
"8","Stuart: I put on pants."
"8","Howard: Kiss-ass."
"8","Bernadette: Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom."
"8","Raj: Hey, I don’t even live here."
"8","Bernadette: Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?"
"8","Raj: I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: You don’t look very happy."
"8","Sheldon: Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Shelly does not like change."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen."
"8","Penny: Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Hello. Oh, okay."
"8","Penny: Sorry, I forgot."
"8","Sheldon: You remember my mother."
"8","Penny: Oh, yes. Hi, Mary."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Good to see you again, dear."
"8","Penny: Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about."
"8","Leonard: So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged."
"8","Penny: Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits."
"8","Leonard: We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?"
"8","Sheldon: Oh, sure."
"8","Leonard: It came from Tiffany’s."
"8","Sheldon: You mean the box, right?"
"8","Leonard: Keep walking."
"8","Penny: Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think."
"8","Sheldon: Did I misspeak about the ring?"
"8","Leonard: Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers."
"8","Sheldon: Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?"
"8","Leonard: Yes, you are a super weaner."
"8","Sheldon: Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler."
"8","Sheldon: Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you."
"8","Penny: We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right."
"8","Mrs Cooper: It doesn’t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Uch."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Uch? The bible is uch to you?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: No, I’m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people’s superstitions can be to them."
"8","Mrs Cooper: You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: His name is Sigmund Freud."
"8","Penny: Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Stay out of this."
"8","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"8","Mrs Cooper: At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: It’s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?"
"8","Mrs Cooper: I know the answer. You’re not gonna like it."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Try me."
"8","Mrs Cooper: When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: : It means, I can’t believe we’re having this conversation."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself."
"8","Penny: Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are."
"8","Sheldon: It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you."
"8","Leonard: Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me."
"8","Raj: How old is this Jell-O?"
"8","Stuart: Well, it’s carrots, so gonna say very."
"8","Howard: Sorry we have to do this."
"8","Stuart: Bernadette’s not wrong. She does work hard around here."
"8","Raj: Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much."
"8","Howard: She doesn’t baby me."
"8","Stuart: I saw her pull you home in a wagon."
"8","Howard: For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck."
"8","Raj: Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship."
"8","Howard: You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess."
"8","Scene: A coffee shop."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: I’m terribly sorry that I upset your mother."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: I can’t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies."
"8","Sheldon: Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: But look how well you turned out."
"8","Sheldon: I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: I suppose."
"8","Sheldon: While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Do you suppose you would’ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?"
"8","Sheldon: Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?"
"8","Leonard: Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, I’m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way."
"8","Penny: Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love."
"8","Penny: Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit."
"8","Leonard: That’s not what it is."
"8","Penny: I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz."
"8","Mrs Cooper: When your mom gets back, I’m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her."
"8","Penny: Well, come on now, she did kind of start it."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Doesn’t matter, a good Christian would’ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would’ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?"
"8","Leonard: Oh, me."
"8","Penny: Yeah, me, too."
"8","Mrs Cooper: Coming up."
"8","Leonard: I don’t really feel I deserve it."
"8","Howard: That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it."
"8","Raj: Looks good."
"8","Stuart: Yeah."
"8","Bernadette: Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself."
"8","Howard: Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave."
"8","Mrs Cooper: I’m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs."
"8","Mrs Cooper: And I will pray for you."
"8","Leonard: Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: One moment. There’s something I need to say to you."
"8","Leonard: Oh, really? That’s too bad."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child."
"8","Sheldon: I taught her that."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love."
"8","Leonard: Wow. When does that start?"
"8","Dr Hofstadter: So needy. Come to Mommy."
"8","Penny: It’s okay, go ahead."
"8","Dr Hofstadter: Oh, my son."
"8","Leonard: Oh, my mother."
"8","Penny: Oh, my God."
"8","Stuart (singing): It’s a hard-knock life."
"8","(singing):"
"8","Together (singing): It’s the hard-knock life for us, it’s the hard-knock life for us. ‘Stead of treated, we get tricked, ‘stead of kisses, we get kicked, it’s the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it’s the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets ‘stead of wool, empty bellies ‘stead of full, it’s a hard-knock life."

"8","Amy: That’s what you’re thinking about?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, one of the things."
"8","Amy: Are any of them me?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway."
"8","Amy: What are you doing?"
"8","Sheldon: You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood."
"8","Amy: I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show."
"8","Sheldon: Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here."
"8","Amy: Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?"
"8","Sheldon: Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try."
"8","Amy: Oh, sure, I’d love to."
"8","Sheldon: Whenever you’re ready."

"8","Emily: If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?"
"8","Raj: You’re kidding, right?"
"8","Emily: Oh. Is this freaking you out?"
"8","Raj: I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose."
"8","Emily: All right. Never mind."
"8","Raj: No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you."

"8","Penny: Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables."
"8","Leonard: Hey."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance."
"8","Leonard: Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?"
"8","Sheldon: What happened?"
"8","Penny: Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals."
"8","Sheldon: Been there."
"8","Penny: Mmm. So what do you need help with?"
"8","Sheldon: Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why."
"8","Penny: Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?"
"8","Sheldon: Yes."
"8","Penny: That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?"
"8","Sheldon: Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series."
"8","Penny: And that made her angry?"
"8","Sheldon: Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face."
"8","Penny: Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her."
"8","Sheldon: It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash."
"8","Penny: Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?"
"8","Leonard: I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines."
"8","Leonard: I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly."
"8","Penny: Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night."
"8","Sheldon: Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary."
"8","Penny: Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat."
"8","Sheldon: If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can."
"8","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"8","Raj: You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?"
"8","Bernadette: You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?"
"8","Raj: No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard."
"8","Howard: One more time?"
"8","Raj: She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave."
"8","Howard: Like, a random person or somebody she knew?"
"8","Raj: What difference does it make?"
"8","Howard: Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge."
"8","Bernadette: The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it."
"8","Raj: Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night."
"8","Raj: I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her."
"8","Howard: Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?"
"8","Bernadette: I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it."
"8","Howard: How are you saying that with a straight face?"
"8","Bernadette: I don’t know."
"8","Raj: You guys are being jerks."
"8","Howard: Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life."
"8","Raj: You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door."
"8","Howard: That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for."
"8","Raj: Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am."
"8","Bernadette: That’s not true. We were just laughing right in your face."
"8","Penny: Thanks for cooking."
"8","Leonard: Mmm. My pleasure."
"8","Penny: That carrot was delicious."
"8","Leonard: Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em."
"8","Penny: Still haven’t heard from her?"
"8","Sheldon: No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now."
"8","Penny: Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship."
"8","Sheldon: Too slow?"
"8","Penny: Yeah, you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together."
"8","Sheldon: That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship."
"8","Penny: Uh, hello."
"8","Sheldon: Hello."
"8","Penny: No. Sheldon, we’re getting married."
"8","Sheldon: But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date."
"8","Penny: Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush."
"8","Sheldon: Okay."
"8","Leonard: We’re gonna set a date."
"8","Sheldon: Okay. If you say so."
"8","Penny: Yeah, it’s just, things are good right now."
"8","Leonard: Really good."
"8","Penny: I’m focusing on my job."
"8","Leonard: And we’ve been busy with our paper."
"8","Penny: So busy."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date."
"8","Penny: Yeah."
"8","Penny: You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you."
"8","Sheldon: Yeah, shut up, Sheldon."
"8","Bernadette: Did you eat all my yoghurt?"
"8","Howard: You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?"
"8","Bernadette: You know which yoghurt I mean."
"8","Howard: I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart."
"8","Bernadette: Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out."
"8","Howard: We should have done it months ago."
"8","Bernadette: I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick."
"8","Howard: Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that."
"8","Bernadette: All right. Tonight’s the night."
"8","Howard: Agreed. When he gets home, I’m dropping the hammer."
"8","Bernadette: Ooh, I like when you take charge."
"8","Howard: Oh, I’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer."
"8","Leonard: So, why haven’t we picked a date?"
"8","Penny: You know why."
"8","Leonard: Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?"
"8","Penny: Not in a rush, busy with work…"
"8","Sheldon: Things are good right now."
"8","Penny: Really good."
"8","Leonard: You still want to get married, right?"
"8","Penny: Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?"
"8","Leonard: I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?"
"8","Penny: Well, you want a date, pick a date."
"8","Leonard: It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?"
"8","Sheldon: Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now."
"8","Penny: Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?"
"8","Leonard: Is your dad paying for it?"
"8","Penny: I doubt it."
"8","Leonard: Okay, two friends each."
"8","Penny: All right, well, I want it in a church."
"8","Leonard: Fine. I want black-tie."
"8","Penny: Fine. I want to release butterflies."
"8","Sheldon: Seriously? Airborne worms?"
"8","Leonard: Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies."
"8","Penny: Sounds perfect."
"8","Leonard: Great."
"8","Sheldon: You still didn’t pick a date."
"8","Penny: Stay out of it."
"8","Leonard: Shut up."
"8","Scene: A graveyard."
"8","Emily: Mmm. It’s a beautiful night."
"8","Raj: Oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am."
"8","Emily: Makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?"
"8","Raj: So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are."
"8","Emily: You aren’t scared, are you?"
"8","Raj: Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit."
"8","Sheldon: I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions."
"8","Penny: No, it’s okay."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff."
"8","Sheldon: Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?"
"8","Penny: Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now."
"8","Sheldon: Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?"
"8","Penny: Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything."
"8","Sheldon: So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?"
"8","Leonard: Sheldon, I’m not a whiner."
"8","Sheldon: It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it."
"8","Leonard: Look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now."
"8","Penny: Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross."
"8","Leonard: Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together."
"8","Sheldon: My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt."
"8","Penny: Um, I’m free tonight."
"8","Leonard: Are you saying you want to get married?"
"8","Penny: Vegas isn’t that far away."
"8","Leonard: I’m in. Let’s do it."
"8","Sheldon: After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you."
"8","Penny: Oh, thank you."
"8","Leonard: Thanks."
"8","Sheldon: Now get out of my spot."
"8","Howard: Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness."
"8","Bernadette: Right."
"8","Howard: Good luck."
"8","Bernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here."
"8","Howard: Never should have told you my middle name."
"8","Stuart: Hey, guys."
"8","Howard: Hey, you got a minute?"
"8","Stuart: Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries."
"8","Bernadette: Don’t let that sway you."
"8","Howard: It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries."
"8","Stuart: What’s up?"
"8","Bernadette: So, we need to talk."
"8","Scene: The graveyard."
"8","Emily: You okay?"
"8","Raj: I think we should talk."
"8","Stuart: Is everything okay?"
"8","Bernadette: Well, you’ve been living here a while now."
"8","Stuart: I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me."
"8","Bernadette: Yeah."
"8","Howard: His middle name is David. Go."
"8","Raj: Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people."
"8","Emily: Are you breaking up with me?"
"8","Raj: No, no, I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside."
"8","Bernadette: So, anyway, what I’m trying to say is… (phone rings)"
"8","(phone rings)"
"8","Howard: You need to take that?"
"8","Stuart: It’s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I’ll call him back. You were saying?"
"8","Emily: Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don’t expect me to do it for you."
"8","Raj: End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you."
"8","Howard and Bernadette (singing): Happy birthday to you."
"8","(singing)"
"8","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"8","Penny: Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in."
"8","Leonard: Doesn’t sound very romantic."
"8","Penny: Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes."
"8","Leonard: I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel."
"8","Penny: Yeah. This is crazy."
"8","Leonard: I know. You think people are gonna be mad?"
"8","Penny: Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us."
"8","Leonard: It is. It is about us."
"8","Penny: And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets."
"8","Leonard: Right. No surprises."
"8","Penny: And no regrets."
"8","Leonard: Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you."
"8","Penny: What?"
"8","Leonard: You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us."
"8","Leonard: Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?"
"8","Leonard: Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on."
"8","Penny: No, you told me."
"8","Leonard: Okay, um, well, there was this girl."
"8","Penny: What did you do?"
"8","Leonard: Nothing really. It was just kissing."
"8","Penny: And then what?"
"8","Leonard: And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know."
"8","Penny: All right."
"8","Leonard: Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?"
"8","Penny: Nope, never."
"8","Leonard: Oh, that’s too bad."
"8","Penny: You know, can I ask you a question?"
"8","Leonard: Hmm?"
"8","Penny: Why are you telling me this now?"
"8","Leonard: Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets."
"8","Penny: Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it."
"8","Leonard: Would you rather I didn’t tell you?"
"8","Penny: No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us."
"8","Leonard: See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?"
"8","Penny: Uh, keep your mouth off other women."
"8","Leonard: I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it."
"8","Penny: Okay."
"8","Leonard: Yeah?"
"8","Penny: Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing."
"8","Leonard: Right."
"8","Penny: Just kissing."
"8","Leonard: It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick."
"8","Penny: Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking."
"8","Leonard: So, we’re still getting married?"
"8","Penny: Yes."
"8","Leonard: Because we love each other."
"8","Leonard: And it’s the happiest day of our lives."
"8","Penny: Ha-ha, don’t push it."
"8","Amy (on skype): Hello."
"8","(on skype)"
"8","Sheldon: Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…"
"8","Amy: I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years."
"8","Sheldon: Strongly disagree. Go on."
"8","Amy: Okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation."
"8","Sheldon: Oh."
"8","Amy: I hope you understand."
"8","Amy: Bye, Sheldon."
"8","Sheldon: Well, Gollum, you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?"
