"10","Series 10 Episode 01 – The Conjugal Conjecture"
"10","Following a “previously on” sequence."
"10","Sceme: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom."
"10","Sheldon: Leonard? Leonard?"
"10","Leonard: What?"
"10","Sheldon: You realize you and I could become brothers."
"10","Leonard: We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep."
"10","Sheldon: I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird."
"10","Leonard: Go to sleep."
"10","Sheldon: Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?"
"10","Leonard: No."
"10","Sheldon: Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?"
"10","Penny: Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep."
"10","Sheldon: Very well."
"10","Leonard: I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward."
"10","Penny: God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Penny: Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, drive safe."
"10","Penny: Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb."
"10","Sheldon: It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example."
"10","Penny: What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now."
"10","Beverley: Penny, wait."
"10","Penny: Why?"
"10","Beverley: I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend."
"10","Leonard: Well, why? What’s wrong?"
"10","Sheldon: Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?"
"10","Beverley: I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?"
"10","Beverley: Stop it, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?"
"10","Beverley: I don’t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately."
"10","Penny: Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap."
"10","Sheldon: And turned their phones off."
"10","Leonard: Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay."
"10","Penny: Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin."
"10","Beverley: Well, we can’t have that."
"10","Sheldon: You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Raj: It is funny when you think about it."
"10","Howard: Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket."
"10","Bernadette: Because you were driving like a lunatic."
"10","Howard: Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay."
"10","Raj (doorbell rings): Oh, I’ll get it."
"10","(doorbell rings)"
"10","Bernadette: It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over."
"10","Howard: I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that."
"10","Raj: Hello."
"10","Air Force Officer: I’m looking for Howard Wolowitz."
"10","Raj: Howard Wolowitz?"
"10","Air Force Officer: I have the right address, don’t I?"
"10","Raj: Address?"
"10","Air Force Officer: Is he here?"
"10","Raj: Um, no."
"10","Air Force Officer: Do you know where I can find him?"
"10","Raj: May I ask what this is about?"
"10","Air Force Officer: No, you may not."
"10","Raj: Very well."
"10","Air Force Officer: Have him call me."
"10","Raj: Okay."
"10","Howard (off): Raj, who’s at the door?"
"10","(off)"
"10","Raj: That’s not him."
"10","Scene: Penny’s car."
"10","Penny: Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you."
"10","Susan (Penny’s mother): Like what? Do they know about your brother?"
"10","Penny: Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part."
"10","Susan: Why would you do that?"
"10","Penny: What?"
"10","Susan: The world doesn’t need to know our problems."
"10","Penny: Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…"
"10","Wyatt (Penny’s father): Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too."
"10","Susan: You really think it’s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?"
"10","Wyatt: Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear."
"10","Susan: Well, quit it."
"10","Penny: So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California."
"10","Randall (Penny’s brother): Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn’t have left the state."
"10","Susan: All right, that’s enough jail talk."
"10","Randall: Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes."
"10","Susan: You sent your brother cigarettes?"
"10","Wyatt: He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide."
"10","Susan: Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it."
"10","Wyatt: Anyway, we’re here, slugger."
"10","Howard: That’s great, now they know where I live."
"10","Raj: What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house."
"10","Raj: Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?"
"10","Howard: Yeah. I would not have done that for you."
"10","Bernadette: Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants."
"10","Howard: All right, all right."
"10","Raj: Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door."
"10","Howard: Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams."
"10","Raj: Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me."
"10","Howard: Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?"
"10","Raj: That’s what he said to me."
"10","Leonard: Here you are, Mother."
"10","Beverley: Thank you."
"10","Leonard: I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you."
"10","Beverley: I can’t wait for this day to be over."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, special, like that. (Knock on door) That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are."
"10","(Knock on door)"
"10","Sheldon: All right, so less or equally awkward, got it."
"10","Leonard: Hey, guys, come on in."
"10","Alfred: Oh, thank you."
"10","Mary: Good morning."
"10","Beverley: Morning."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Alfred: How is everyone today?"
"10","Beverley: Good, and you?"
"10","Alfred: Good, good."
"10","Beverley: Good."
"10","Mary: I’m good, too."
"10","Sheldon: So, did you defile my mother or not?"
"10","Mary: Sheldon. You’re being rude."
"10","Alfred: If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation."
"10","Sheldon: Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?"
"10","Mary: That’s enough."
"10","Alfred: Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that."
"10","Leonard: You don’t know his girlfriend very well."
"10","Sheldon: Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals."
"10","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"10","Penny: All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
"10","Randall: You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard."
"10","Wyatt: Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor."
"10","Susan: Not funny, Wyatt."
"10","Penny: I thought it was really funny."
"10","Wyatt: Thanks."
"10","Susan: Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment."
"10","Randall: That’s not much of a joke."
"10","Penny: Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family."
"10","Susan: Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash."
"10","Randall: Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?"
"10","Mary: How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?"
"10","Sheldon: A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker."
"10","Leonard: Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again."
"10","Alfred: Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York."
"10","Mary: Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas."
"10","Alfred: Maybe we meet halfway."
"10","Sheldon: What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway."
"10","Beverley: You’re not seriously going to visit each other."
"10","Alfred: And why wouldn’t we?"
"10","Beverley: Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me."
"10","Alfred: Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus."
"10","Leonard: Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this."
"10","Mary: No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father."
"10","Sheldon: What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate."
"10","Leonard: Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?"
"10","Leonard: This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall."
"10","Sheldon: But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?"
"10","Leonard: Fine, then you go."
"10","Mary: Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go."
"10","Alfred: I’ll go with you."
"10","Leonard: That still leaves me here with him."
"10","Sheldon: Hang on, hang on. We’re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh, here. I’ve got it."
"10","Amy: Who’s ready for a wedding?"
"10","Sheldon: Great, now I have to start all over."
"10","Wyatt: So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?"
"10","Penny: Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory."
"10","Susan: See what happens when you work hard?"
"10","Randall: Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em."
"10","Susan: Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip."
"10","Wyatt: I’ll drink to that."
"10","Susan: Haven’t you had enough?"
"10","Wyatt: Penny drinks more than I do."
"10","Penny: Well, I learned from the best."
"10","Wyatt: Aw."
"10","Penny: Aw."
"10","Susan: Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did."
"10","Randall: You see what I’ve gotta put up with."
"10","Susan: What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?"
"10","Randall: It’s called getting caught, Mother."
"10","Leonard: Hello."
"10","Wyatt: Hey, there he is."
"10","Penny: Hey."
"10","Susan: Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again."
"10","Leonard: Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley."
"10","Beverley: Hello."
"10","Susan: Hi."
"10","Randall: We are not white trash."
"10","Amy: Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?"
"10","Alfred: Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused."
"10","Mary: Oh, so am I."
"10","Sheldon: You made God sad today, Mom."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off."
"10","Sheldon: Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years."
"10","Amy: It was a lot hotter than it sounds."
"10","Alfred: You’re a patient young lady."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa."
"10","Howard: Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news."
"10","Raj: Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it."
"10","Howard: That’s really stupid advice."
"10","Raj: You know that hurts my feelings."
"10","Howard: Calm down, try not to think about it."
"10","Howard: Why do I bother talking to you?"
"10","Raj: Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?"
"10","Howard: I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?"
"10","Raj: Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation."
"10","Howard: What’s the point of that story?"
"10","Raj: I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. (Howard laughs) There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife."
"10","(Howard laughs)"
"10","Beverley: So, what do you do for a living?"
"10","Randall: Mommy, you want to take this one?"
"10","Susan: Um, Randall’s in between jobs."
"10","Randall: And court appearances."
"10","Wyatt: It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father."
"10","Beverley: Prepare to be disappointed."
"10","Leonard: And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?"
"10","Wyatt: Well, I could use another beer."
"10","Susan: You’re done. He’s done."
"10","Penny: Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?"
"10","Randall: Not at all."
"10","Scene: The wedding ceremony."
"10","Stuart: Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I’m, uh, Leonard’s friend, Stuart."
"10","Beverley: Nice to see you, too."
"10","Stuart: Hi, I’m Stuart."
"10","Alfred: Oh, I’m Alfred. Leonard’s father."
"10","Stuart: Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I’m sorry, did you two want to sit together?"
"10","Together: No."
"10","Stuart: I was wondering why the front row was available."
"10","Bernadette: Okay, I think we’re ready."
"10","Sheldon: Why do people cry at weddings?"
"10","Mary: They’re practicing for what’s coming later."
"10","Susan: Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding."
"10","Randall: Thank you for my new teeth."
"10","Wyatt: Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money."
"10","Bernadette: We’re here today to celebrate love."
"10","Beverley: Urgh."
"10","Alfred: Sigh louder, no one heard you."
"10","Stuart: Really, I can move."
"10","Bernadette: Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other."
"10","Sheldon: Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing."
"10","Bernadette: Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off."
"10","Howard: At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change."
"10","Bernadette: Howard."
"10","Penny: Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time."
"10","Leonard: Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t"
"10","need to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny."
"10","Penny: Oh."
"10","Bernadette: Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so."
"10","Alfred: I’d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don’t bring out the best in each other."
"10","But something wonderful did come from our relationship. That young man right there."
"10","Beverley: I couldn’t agree more."
"10","Stuart: That’s beautiful."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you. All right, let’s continue."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer."
"10","Amy: It’s happening."
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you."
"10","Leonard: Thank you."
"10","Bernadette: Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment."
"10","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"10","Beverley: Thank you for taking us to the airport."
"10","Leonard: Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute."
"10","Alfred: Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I’m sorry if I upset you."
"10","Beverley: Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don’t you get into the carpool lane?"
"10","Alfred: Well, that’s a solid line. He can’t cross that."
"10","Leonard: That’s okay. I can make it over."
"10","Beverley: No, no, let’s plod along. It’ll make your father feel more comfortable."
"10","Alfred: What makes me comfortable is knowing I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face."
"10","Beverley: Do the world a favour, and don’t wake up tomorrow morning."
"10","Leonard: That was almost a minute."
"10","Scene: Amy’s car."
"10","Mary: There’s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?"
"10","Amy: You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight."
"10","Mary: Good. Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy."
"10","Mary: Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me."
"10","Sheldon: Yes ma’am."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her."
"10","Sheldon: Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business."
"10","Amy: I will not have you be disrespectful to me."
"10","Sheldon: What, you’re not my mother."
"10","Mary: Don’t you be disrespectful to her."
"10","Mary: You’ll get there. You’ve just gotta put some zing on it."
"10","Susan: Penny, I don’t know what I was worried about. You’re friends are just lovely."
"10","Penny: Oh, thanks, Mom."
"10","Susan: Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar."
"10","Penny: Is he? I never noticed."
"10","Wyatt: He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain."
"10","Randall: Cops, cops, be cool."
"10","Series 10 Episode 02 – The Military Miniturization"
"10","Following a “previously on” sequence."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game."
"10","Leonard: So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game."
"10","Howard (entering): All right, we got a problem."
"10","(entering)"
"10","Leonard: What’s up?"
"10","Howard: The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting."
"10","Leonard: Really?"
"10","Raj: Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, what did he say?"
"10","Raj: He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard."
"10","Sheldon: That doesn’t sound terrifying."
"10","Raj: To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying."
"10","Leonard: You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us."
"10","Howard: And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially."
"10","Leonard: There goes our big payday."
"10","Howard: I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don’t have to try so hard in bed."
"10","Leonard: You do that, too?"
"10","Howard: Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?"
"10","Sheldon: Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?"
"10","Raj: Well, you’re kidding, right?"
"10","Sheldon: Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?"
"10","Howard: Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years."
"10","Sheldon: Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?"
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"10","Bernadette: I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck."
"10","Penny: All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds."
"10","Bernadette: He won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone."
"10","Penny: You know, when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk."
"10","Amy: Does that help?"
"10","Penny: Well, for a while. Then he comes back."
"10","Bernadette: I don’t believe this."
"10","Amy: What’s wrong?"
"10","Bernadette: This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant."
"10","Amy: You did already know, right?"
"10","Bernadette: No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?"
"10","Penny: No. You told me not to."
"10","Bernadette: I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great."
"10","Amy: Why don’t you want anyone to know?"
"10","Bernadette: ‘Cause I’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I’m pregnant they might give it to someone else."
"10","Penny: Would they really do that?"
"10","Bernadette: I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant."
"10","Raj: Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project."
"10","Leonard: Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat."
"10","Raj: Fine, I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman."
"10","Howard: You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer."
"10","Leonard: That’s not a bad idea."
"10","Raj: Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer."
"10","Howard: Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?"
"10","Raj: My cousin does work in a call centre."
"10","Howard: And my cousin’s a lawyer."
"10","Sheldon: We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me."
"10","Leonard: You’re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all."
"10","Sheldon: I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong."
"10","Leonard: That’s the definition of being a know-it-all."
"10","Sheldon: Or in German, a Besserwisser."
"10","Penny: How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?"
"10","Bernadette: I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain."
"10","Amy: Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?"
"10","Bernadette: From all the Dove Bars I ate. I’m pregnant. Try to keep up. I’m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows."
"10","Amy: Well, whatever happens, we’re here for you."
"10","Bernadette: Thanks. You guys are the best."
"10","Penny: Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
"10","Amy: What?"
"10","Penny: I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…"
"10","Bernadette: I forgot my coat."
"10","Penny: Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her."
"10","Amy: Oh, but you did it so well. That’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies."
"10","Penny: Is that really what’s important right now?"
"10","Amy: I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up."
"10","Penny: That’s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that."
"10","Amy: I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here."
"10","Scene: Howard’s workshop."
"10","Howard: Give me a second to call my cousin."
"10","Sheldon: I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property."
"10","Howard: First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy."
"10","Howard’s cousin (on skype): Hello."
"10","(on skype)"
"10","Howard: Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us."
"10","Marty: Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me."
"10","Howard: Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we’re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system."
"10","Leonard: Hi."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Howard: And this is my friend, Raj."
"10","Raj: Oh, I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office."
"10","Leonard: I saw it. It’s big."
"10","Howard: Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?"
"10","Marty: Well, I don’t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don’t sign anything."
"10","Sheldon: Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?"
"10","Marty: That’s not what I meant."
"10","Sheldon: That’s what you said."
"10","Sheldon: This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say."
"10","Marty: Howard, why is he yelling at me?"
"10","Sheldon: All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?"
"10","Howard: Marty, let me call you back."
"10","Leonard: Someday, when I’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me."
"10","Sheldon: You don’t need him. I’ll represent you."
"10","Scene: Bernadette’s office."
"10","Penny: Hi."
"10","Bernadette: Hey. What brings you by?"
"10","Penny: Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill."
"10","Bernadette: Oh. How was it?"
"10","Penny: Great."
"10","Bernadette: Fell asleep?"
"10","Penny: In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?"
"10","Bernadette: I’m furious."
"10","Penny: Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?"
"10","Bernadette: No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about."
"10","Penny: Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights."
"10","Bernadette: It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?"
"10","Penny: Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her."
"10","Bernadette: What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay."
"10","Penny: Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows."
"10","Bernadette: Why did you do that?"
"10","Penny: Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied."
"10","Bernadette: Get out."
"10","Penny: Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth."
"10","Sheldon: I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting."
"10","Leonard: ‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people."
"10","Sheldon: Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?"
"10","Leonard: Yes."
"10","Sheldon: Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?"
"10","Leonard: I’m getting enraged."
"10","Sheldon: Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?"
"10","Howard: No."
"10","Leonard: Don’t speak."
"10","Sheldon’s phone: Aw, nuts."
"10","Colonel Williams: Gentlemen, I’m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me."
"10","Howard: Hello."
"10","Colonel Williams: So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?"
"10","Howard: It’s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me."
"10","Sheldon: (Strangled sound)"
"10","(Strangled sound)"
"10","Scene: The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope."
"10","Colonel Williams: And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?"
"10","Leonard: Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics."
"10","Colonel Williams: Well, I’m a scientist by training."
"10","Howard: Really? You’re a physicist?"
"10","Colonel Williams: Better. I’m an engineer."
"10","Leonard: Where did you go to school?"
"10","Colonel Williams: MIT."
"10","Howard: Oh. Well, hey, me, too."
"10","Colonel Williams: I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I’ll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there’s an application for this technology, and we’re interested in funding your research."
"10","Howard: Well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons."
"10","Colonel Williams: Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business."
"10","Leonard: I don’t know how I feel about this."
"10","Colonel Williams: Look, guys, it’s just a guidance system. It’s not like you’re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it’s this big, and we need it to be this big."
"10","Leonard: That’s a lot less big."
"10","Colonel Williams: Yes, it’s this much less big."
"10","Howard: I’m not even sure that’s possible."
"10","Colonel Williams: Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months."
"10","Howard: Four months?"
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren’t real scientists, MIT’s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service."
"10","Amy: Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes."
"10","Amy: I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax."
"10","Bernadette: Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?"
"10","Amy: Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?"
"10","Bernadette: I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing."
"10","Amy: You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?"
"10","Bernadette: Are you kidding? I’ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s I wonder if her mommy"
"10","knows where she is."
"10","Amy: I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal."
"10","Bernadette: I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant."
"10","Amy: I understand how you feel."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you."
"10","Amy: I wish there were some way I could make it better."
"10","Bernadette: Well, you brought me French fries. That’s a start."
"10","Amy: Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant."
"10","Bernadette: Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?"
"10","Amy: I’ll be right back."
"10","Bernadette: And a chocolate shake."
"10","Penny: What are you doing?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, Leonard’s mad at me, so I’m making him lemon bars."
"10","Penny: Does he even like lemon bars?"
"10","Sheldon: Not really. But I’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is."
"10","Penny: Something happen at the meeting?"
"10","Sheldon: They made me promise I wouldn’t talk."
"10","Penny: And you talked?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me."
"10","Penny: Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too."
"10","Sheldon: Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction."
"10","Penny: Why would that make me feel better?"
"10","Sheldon: Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational."
"10","Penny: Okay. Never mind."
"10","Sheldon: Look, I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you."
"10","Penny: Well, I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know."
"10","Sheldon: Why would you do that?"
"10","Penny: Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible."
"10","Sheldon: See, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets."
"10","Raj: Is it even possible to get this done in two months?"
"10","Howard: Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week."
"10","Leonard: Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage."
"10","Howard: I love your French toast."
"10","Leonard: Oh, thanks, man."
"10","Raj: So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?"
"10","Howard: We didn’t. Sheldon did."
"10","Raj: And you just let him?"
"10","Leonard: Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial."
"10","Howard: No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay."
"10","Raj: So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while."
"10","Leonard: Oh, looks like it."
"10","Raj: Wow. You’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel."
"10","Howard: Would you stop? We’re just gonna be on the other side of campus."
"10","Raj: And right here."
"10","Howard: You are a deeply silly man."
"10","Raj: He is so afraid of his feelings."
"10","Scene: Outside Penny’s door."
"10","Penny: Oh, hi."
"10","Bernadette: Got a minute?"
"10","Penny: Yeah, come on in."
"10","Bernadette: I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident."
"10","Penny: Oh, thank you, and I’m sorry I lied about it."
"10","Bernadette: For what it’s worth, you’re a great liar."
"10","Penny: Oh, that’s what Amy said. So what’s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?"
"10","Bernadette: Well, my boss said he hadn’t decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy, and I’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury."
"10","Penny: You threatened to sue?"
"10","Bernadette: Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch, that’s where you punch."
"10","Penny: That’s funny. I learned something totally different."
"10","Bernadette: Do you know what? It’s just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It’s all I need to give my life meaning."
"10","Penny: Oh, that’s so beautiful."
"10","Bernadette: You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I’ll have the jury eating out of my hand."
"10","Scene: A corridor at the university."
"10","Sheldon: I never realized this building was classified."
"10","Howard: Maybe that’s because it’s classified."
"10","Leonard: Wish we weren’t so far from my parking space."
"10","Sheldon: The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing."
"10","Leonard: I’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule."
"10","Sheldon: Why? It clearly doesn’t work."
"10","Howard: I guess this is it."
"10","Leonard: Is that a retinal scanner?"
"10","Howard: Let’s find out."
"10","Scanner: Howard Wolowitz, access granted."
"10","Leonard: No way."
"10","Sheldon: Impressive."
"10","Leonard: Oh, my turn, my turn."
"10","Scanner: Leonard Hofstadter, access granted."
"10","Leonard: I didn’t even have to take my glasses off/"
"10","Scanner (as Leonard and Sheldon try to fool it with one eye each): Access denied."
"10","(as Leonard and Sheldon try to fool it with one eye each)"
"10","Leonard and Sheldon: It knows."
"10","Howard: Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down."
"10","All: Yay."
"10","Series 10 Episode 03 -The Dependence Transcendence"
"10","Scene: The new laboratory."
"10","Howard: It’s pretty late. You think I’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?"
"10","Leonard: Sure, I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts."
"10","Howard: What?"
"10","Sheldon: It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all."
"10","Howard: Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere."
"10","Leonard: We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you."
"10","Sheldon: I know, I was there."
"10","Howard: Well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights."
"10","Sheldon: How late?"
"10","Howard: Well, I don’t know, midnight, one."
"10","Sheldon: One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon."
"10","Howard: If you’re tired, have some coffee."
"10","Sheldon: What? You have some coffee."
"10","Howard: I am having coffee."
"10","Sheldon: And look how irritable it’s making you!"
"10","Leonard: Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try"
"10","to soldier through?"
"10","Sheldon: Fine. (Time passing montage) I don’t think I can go much longer."
"10","(Time passing montage)"
"10","Leonard: It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Sheldon: I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work."
"10","Leonard: Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed."
"10","Penny: Good morning."
"10","Leonard: What is this?"
"10","Amy: Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together."
"10","Leonard: Oh, that is so nice."
"10","Sheldon: Ow, it does hurt."
"10","Leonard: So, what are you guys gonna do today?"
"10","Amy: Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don’t think that’s happening."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, that was never happening."
"10","Penny: Oh, I’ll go. I like a party."
"10","Amy: Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry."
"10","Penny: It’s okay, I’ll still go."
"10","Leonard: You don’t think you’ll be bored?"
"10","Penny: Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?"
"10","Sheldon: I won’t be there."
"10","Leonard: : Look at that, it is a party."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Howard: Sorry I have to work all weekend."
"10","Bernadette: It’s okay."
"10","Howard: Thanks again for breakfast."
"10","Raj: Well, I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do."
"10","Bernadette: You shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday."
"10","Raj: So, what should we do today?"
"10","Bernadette: Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me."
"10","Raj: Well, I don’t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?"
"10","Bernadette: Not really."
"10","Raj: Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies."
"10","Bernadette: I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother’s for Christmas."
"10","Raj: Oh, I know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?"
"10","Bernadette: Isn’t it a little early for that?"
"10","Raj: You have to get to it eventually."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing."
"10","Raj: How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth."
"10","Bernadette: I don’t think you are."
"10","Raj: You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am."
"10","Scene: In the university, Sheldon is asleep against a vending machine."
"10","Voice: Psst, hey, kid."
"10","Sheldon: Huh, what?"
"10","The Flash (the voice): You look tired. Why don’t you have an energy drink? Everyone’s doing it."
"10","(the voice)"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them."
"10","The Flash: Oh sorry, I thought you were cool."
"10","Sheldon: I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin."
"10","The Flash: All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these."
"10","Sheldon: Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?"
"10","The Flash: You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch."
"10","Sheldon: I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them."
"10","The Flash: Here. It’s on the house."
"10","Sheldon: The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?"
"10","The Flash: You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel."
"10","Scene: Bert’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny."
"10","Penny: Hi."
"10","Bert: Hey, come on in. I’ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That’s a geology joke."
"10","Amy: Bert’s a geologist."
"10","Bert: And a joker."
"10","Penny: How early are we?"
"10","Amy: Oh, actually, we’re an hour late."
"10","Penny: I suddenly wish Sheldon was here."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s spare room."
"10","Bernadette: I don’t even know where to begin."
"10","Raj: Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here."
"10","Raj: Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone."
"10","Bernadette: Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl."
"10","Raj: Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?"
"10","Bernadette: My dad built it for me."
"10","Raj: Wow, it’s so cute."
"10","Bernadette: This was the husband and this was the wife. They’d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog."
"10","Raj: Oh, and did they have kids?"
"10","Bernadette: They did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox."
"10","Raj: Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all."
"10","Bernadette: Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. And it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog."
"10","Raj: I skipped spin class for this."
"10","Scene: The lab."
"10","Howard: Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine"
"10","uncomfortably intimate."
"10","Sheldon: Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars."
"10","Leonard: Are you okay?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers."
"10","Howard: You wanted him awake."
"10","Penny: So should we talk to each other or mingle?"
"10","Amy: I don’t know where everyone is."
"10","Penny: Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party."
"10","Bert: Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don’t have to stay. I’m gonna start cleaning up."
"10","Amy: Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here."
"10","Penny: Oh, it’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you."
"10","Bert: Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ’cause you’re you and I’m me, and it’s kind of embarrassing."
"10","Penny: Wait, what do you mean she’s her?"
"10","Bert: Well, you know how Amy’s the coolest girl on campus, right?"
"10","Penny: No."
"10","Amy: No."
"10","Bert: Oh yeah, everybody thinks so."
"10","Penny: What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?"
"10","Amy: I’m sure it’s just ’cause I’m dating Sheldon."
"10","Bert: Mm, actually, I think Sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you."
"10","Penny: Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?"
"10","Howard: Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?"
"10","Leonard: According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two."
"10","Sheldon: My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever."
"10","Howard: Why don’t you just go home?"
"10","Sheldon: No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no."
"10","Leonard: What?"
"10","Sheldon: I want another one."
"10","Leonard: So?"
"10","Sheldon: That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency."
"10","Leonard: You only had one."
"10","Sheldon: No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop."
"10","Howard: You can’t develop a problem that fast."
"10","Sheldon: You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling."
"10","Leonard: We can’t afford to lose any more time."
"10","Howard: Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?"
"10","Leonard: That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m sorry. Yes, of course."
"10","Leonard: Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal."
"10","Howard: No worries."
"10","Sheldon: You guys stink."
"10","Bernadette: Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones."
"10","Raj: I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?"
"10","Bernadette: Does it really need one?"
"10","Raj: Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?"
"10","Bernadette: Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos."
"10","Raj: Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple."
"10","Bernadette: Are you just gonna name all the colours?"
"10","Raj: Well, not now."
"10","Bernadette: I don’t care what colour the room is."
"10","Raj: Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you."
"10","Bernadette: Well, you’re not, so just drop it. (Off) I’m clearly upset. Why aren’t you following me?"
"10","(Off)"
"10","Raj: Sorry. Sorry."
"10","Bert: And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it."
"10","Penny: You trend setter."
"10","Amy: Just the right idea at the right time."
"10","Penny: Okay, okay, so Amy’s cool, Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard."
"10","Bert: Who?"
"10","Penny: Leonard Hofstadter."
"10","Bert: Oh, him. I guess he’s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him."
"10","Penny: That’s me, I’m her. You know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down."
"10","Bert: It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together."
"10","Amy: And you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party."
"10","Penny: You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school."
"10","Amy: Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart."
"10","Penny: Wow, you popular girls are mean."
"10","Leonard: I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?"
"10","Sheldon: Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?"
"10","Leonard: Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem."
"10","Sheldon: I do."
"10","Leonard: You don’t."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, but I do."
"10","Leonard: No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?"
"10","Sheldon: With what?"
"10","Leonard: Your problem."
"10","Sheldon: I thought I didn’t have a problem."
"10","Howard: That was painful to watch."
"10","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"10","Raj: So where are we going?"
"10","Bernadette: I don’t know."
"10","Raj: Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us."
"10","Bernadette: Raj, why don’t I care about anything?"
"10","Raj: I’m sorry?"
"10","Bernadette: It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?"
"10","Raj: Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind."
"10","Bernadette: I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?"
"10","Raj: Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts."
"10","Bernadette: Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets."
"10","Raj: Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story."
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
"10","Leonard: Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?"
"10","Sheldon: Howard, can I ask you a question?"
"10","Howard: No."
"10","Sheldon: All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…"
"10","Leonard: Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care."
"10","Sheldon: You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator."
"10","Leonard: Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it."
"10","Sheldon: I can’t."
"10","Leonard: Yes, you can."
"10","Sheldon: No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing."
"10","Leonard: Seriously?"
"10","Sheldon: I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault."
"10","Leonard: It’s okay, we’ll figure something out."
"10","Sheldon: But what if we can’t?"
"10","Leonard: It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy? (Sheldon snores)"
"10","(Sheldon snores)"
"10","Howard: When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that."
"10","Bert’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Thank you so much, Bert. This was great."
"10","Bert: My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?"
"10","Amy: I think we’re good."
"10","Bert: Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people."
"10","Penny: Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke."
"10","Bert: You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now."
"10","Penny: Okay."
"10","Amy: Bye."
"10","Raj: Uh, pull over."
"10","Bernadette: What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you."
"10","Raj: Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli (on facetime): Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?"
"10","(on facetime)"
"10","Raj: What? No."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?"
"10","Raj: No."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Great. What’s up?"
"10","Raj: This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Of course. What seems to be the trouble?"
"10","Bernadette: Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby."
"10","Bernadette: But I thought I’d be more excited."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you. I feel better now."
"10","Raj: Well I don’t."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter."
"10","Scene: Colonel Williams’ office."
"10","Leonard: Um, I don’t really know how to say this."
"10","Colonel Williams: Well, you could try starting with sir."
"10","Leonard: Right. Sorry, sir."
"10","Sheldon: He said start with it, not end with it."
"10","Leonard: Sir."
"10","Colonel Williams: Hmm?"
"10","Howard: We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule."
"10","Sheldon: The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought."
"10","Leonard: I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
"10","Colonel Williams: How long do you need?"
"10","Howard: We, we’re thinking, two years."
"10","Colonel Williams: All right."
"10","Howard: That’s it? You’re okay with that?"
"10","Colonel Williams: What, you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time? We’re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies."
"10","Leonard: Thanks for understanding, sir."
"10","Howard: Yes, thank you so much."
"10","Sheldon: We, we really appreciate it."
"10","Leonard (off): All right, pressure’s off"
"10","(off)"
"10","Howard (off): Wanna see a movie?"
"10","Sheldon (off): Popcorn’s on me."
"10","Series 10 Episode 04 – The Cohabitation Experimentation"
"10","Scene: The foyer."
"10","Amy: And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess."
"10","Leonard: That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?"
"10","Amy: About five weeks."
"10","Penny: Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?"
"10","Amy: Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone."
"10","Penny: Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?"
"10","Amy: They didn’t say."
"10","Leonard: Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing."
"10","Penny: Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us."
"10","Amy: Really?"
"10","Penny: Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place."
"10","Amy: You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?"
"10","Penny: No, not at all."
"10","Leonard: And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning."
"10","Amy: So, technically, I’d be moving in with my boyfriend?"
"10","Penny: I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband."
"10","Amy: Oh, my, this is a big step."
"10","Leonard: Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction."
"10","Sheldon: Why are you all smiling like crazy people?"
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process."
"10","Leonard: It’s only for five weeks."
"10","Penny: Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall."
"10","Amy: What do you think?"
"10","Sheldon: I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?"
"10","Penny: Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven."
"10","Leonard: You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?"
"10","Sheldon: Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk."
"10","Leonard: Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same."
"10","Sheldon: If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it."
"10","Penny: Don’t be proud of that."
"10","Amy: So, is that a yes?"
"10","Sheldon: Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment."
"10","Penny: Well, where would you go?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste."
"10","Leonard: And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914"
"10","Penny: Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?"
"10","Sheldon: Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here."
"10","Leonard: That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over."
"10","Sheldon: Historically, I don’t do well with change."
"10","Penny: Okay, it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone."
"10","Sheldon: You’re darn right, you wouldn’t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom."
"10","Leonard: Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, what do you think?"
"10","Sheldon: Very well. I’m on board."
"10","Amy: Seriously?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend."
"10","Amy: Oh. This is so exciting."
"10","Sheldon: Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Raj: I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN."
"10","Howard: Cool. ‘Cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment."
"10","Raj: I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful."
"10","Bernadette: It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix."
"10","Raj: The polite response is, thank you for noticing."
"10","Bernadette: Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob."
"10","Howard: Yeah, we could name him Blobert."
"10","Bernadette: What if it’s a girl?"
"10","Howard: Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I."
"10","Bernadette: Are we being silly not finding out the sex?"
"10","Howard: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing."
"10","Raj: If you want, you can find out right now."
"10","Howard: Mm."
"10","Bernadette: Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter."
"10","Raj: Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder."
"10","Bernadette: You looked in our folder?!"
"10","Raj: It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked."
"10","Howard: So you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?"
"10","Raj: Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot."
"10","Howard: It’s unbelievable."
"10","Bernadette: God, Raj."
"10","Raj: What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you."
"10","Bernadette: We don’t want you to know."
"10","Raj: Okay, well, that’s a problem."
"10","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"10","Penny: You know, I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Thank you."
"10","Penny: Mm."
"10","Sheldon: Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done."
"10","Penny: That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?"
"10","Penny: Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible."
"10","Sheldon: You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along."
"10","Amy: You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?"
"10","Leonard: I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this."
"10","Cutting between Penny’s apartment and Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment."
"10","Penny: I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key."
"10","Leonard: Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes."
"10","Penny: Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed."
"10","Leonard: Keep M&M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line."
"10","Penny: You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space."
"10","Leonard: He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography."
"10","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"10","Sheldon: How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?"
"10","Amy: I don’t know. I didn’t count."
"10","Sheldon: You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant."
"10","Amy: That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain."
"10","Amy: Well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it."
"10","Sheldon: Okay. Talk."
"10","Amy: Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations."
"10","Sheldon: Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it."
"10","Amy: Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it."
"10","Sheldon: You’re really okay with that?"
"10","Amy: I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too."
"10","Sheldon: This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now."
"10","Amy: Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running."
"10","Sheldon: I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children."
"10","Scene: The hallway."
"10","Penny: Well, here’s your key."
"10","Amy: Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: Enjoy having the place to yourselves."
"10","Leonard: You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before."
"10","Sheldon: It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before."
"10","Penny: Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional."
"10","Amy: Shall we?"
"10","Sheldon: I guess this is it."
"10","Leonard: You guys have fun."
"10","Sheldon: You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed."
"10","Penny: Yeah, you wrote it on my hand."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit."
"10","Leonard: I’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together."
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, please, let me go."
"10","Amy: Come on, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Bye."
"10","Leonard: Good night."
"10","Penny: Good night."
"10","Amy: Well, that’s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together."
"10","Sheldon: I guess the experiment begins."
"10","Penny (off, screaming): Wa-how, we did it."
"10","(off, screaming)"
"10","Leonard (off, also screaming): Yeah."
"10","(off, also screaming)"
"10","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"10","Sheldon: Which side of the bed would you prefer?"
"10","Amy: Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice."
"10","Sheldon: No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose."
"10","Amy: Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want."
"10","Sheldon: Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that."
"10","Amy: Well, I’m not refusing. I’m just trying to be considerate."
"10","Sheldon: Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
"10","Amy: Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?"
"10","Sheldon: Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
"10","Amy: Great. That’s your side."
"10","Sheldon: No, but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack."
"10","Amy: Okay, I’ll take that side."
"10","Sheldon: Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
"10","Amy: Rising rapidly."
"10","Sheldon: Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
"10","Amy: Okay. What if we do this?"
"10","Sheldon: I suppose that works."
"10","Amy: Great."
"10","Sheldon: Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"10","Bernadette: This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?"
"10","Howard: I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?"
"10","Bernadette: I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly."
"10","Howard: But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you."
"10","Bernadette: Everyone said I could do better."
"10","Howard: But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da."
"10","Amy (off): Ugh. What is that? (Entering) Why did you switch sides?"
"10","(Entering)"
"10","Sheldon: Be grateful I’m still in the room."
"10","Amy: Comfy?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers."
"10","Amy: Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling."
"10","Sheldon: Well, it’s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall."
"10","Sheldon: Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it."
"10","Leonard: That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night."
"10","Penny: Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment."
"10","Leonard: It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different."
"10","Penny: So, what do you want to do?"
"10","Leonard: I know exactly what we are gonna do."
"10","Penny: Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?"
"10","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear."
"10","Penny: Ugh. Can we just have sex?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable."
"10","Penny: Inevitable, you say?"
"10","Leonard: I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’."
"10","Howard: Screw it. I’m calling and finding out."
"10","Bernadette: Good. Call him. Wait, I’m not sure I want to know."
"10","Howard: But you just said you wanted to know."
"10","Bernadette: Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!"
"10","Raj: Hello?"
"10","Howard: Call you back."
"10","Sheldon: No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn."
"10","Penny: Wow, where did you learn these moves?"
"10","Leonard: The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal."
"10","Howard: Okay, you’re positive you want to know?"
"10","Bernadette: Yes."
"10","Howard: Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing."
"10","Bernadette: Wait."
"10","Howard: Wrong number."
"10","Penny: I told you not to do the worm."
"10","Leonard: You were right."
"10","Scene: Raj’s bedroom. Phone rings."
"10","Raj: Hello."
"10","Bernadette (off): I changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
"10","(off)"
"10","Amy: Oh, oh, oh."
"10","Sheldon: What are you doing down there?"
"10","Amy: Hang on."
"10","Sheldon: Who are you calling? Aaargh!"
"10","Amy: I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night."
"10","Penny: Yeah, get it, girl."
"10","Amy: It’s not what you think."
"10","Leonard: I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?"
"10","Penny: Even more not what you think."
"10","Amy: I don’t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him."
"10","Leonard: If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."
"10","Penny: Yeah."
"10","Sheldon: Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?"
"10","Amy: Miserable and exhausted."
"10","Sheldon: Really? I slept great."
"10","Amy: Well, I didn’t, and it’s your fault."
"10","Sheldon: How? You had the whole floor to yourself."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea."
"10","Sheldon: Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
"10","Amy: The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night."
"10","Sheldon: Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?"
"10","Sheldon: If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits."
"10","Penny: Was that a science diss?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah."
"10","Penny: Was it a good one?"
"10","Leonard: Eh."
"10","Penny: Oh."
"10","Amy: What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables."
"10","Sheldon: How dare you?"
"10","Amy: Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable."
"10","Sheldon: Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?"
"10","Amy: Can’t make fun of something that’s a null set."
"10","Penny: I feel like I should say damn."
"10","Leonard: Do it."
"10","Penny: Damn."
"10","Sheldon: Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
"10","Amy: Well, for science, maybe I will."
"10","Sheldon: For science, maybe you should."
"10","Amy: Fine."
"10","Sheldon: Fine."
"10","Amy: Good."
"10","Sheldon: Great."
"10","Amy: Do you want to go to our place and make out?"
"10","Sheldon: Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?"
"10","Penny: The new neighbours are weird."

"10","Leonard: I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil."
"10","Sheldon: Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?"
"10","Penny: Can’t."
"10","Leonard: Won’t."
"10","Penny: Didn’t."
"10","Leonard: Don’t."
"10","Amy: I told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives."
"10","Sheldon: I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry for bringing this over here."
"10","Penny: Believe me, we know what you’re going through."
"10","Leonard: And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies."
"10","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
"10","Penny: She’s right. That’s reasonable."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter."
"10","Leonard: Hey, she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference."
"10","Penny: Yeah. You tell him, babe."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The comic book store."
"10","Raj: What time do you and Bernadette head out?"
"10","Howard: As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark."
"10","Raj: I’ve never been to Palm Springs."
"10","Stuart: Oh, you should go. It’s terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90."
"10","Raj: I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India."
"10","Stuart: It’s nice you and Bernadette are getting away."
"10","Howard: Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
"10","Stuart: So then what are you doing here buying comic books?"
"10","Howard: Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
"10","Leonard: When you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating."
"10","Sheldon: Well I’m open to that."
"10","Amy: Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
"10","Penny: Sheldon, what do you say to that?"
"10","Sheldon: I think we should see other people."
"10","Amy: What?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."
"10","Amy: We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?"
"10","Sheldon: Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here."
"10","Amy: You wanna see other people? Go see other people."
"10","Penny: I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas."
"10","Leonard: Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here."
"10","Penny: All right. Well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down."
"10","Leonard: Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again."
"10","Penny: So it’s okay for you to joke around?"
"10","Leonard: No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"10","Howard: Honey, how ya feeling? (Sound of Bernadette vomiting violently) The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away. (More vomiting) So that’s good news, right?"
"10","(Sound of Bernadette vomiting violently)"
"10","(More vomiting)"
"10","Bernadette (pff): The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book."
"10","B"
"10","(pff):"
"10","Howard: There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?"
"10","Bernadette: Next vomit is gonna be in your lap."
"10","Howard: I’m sorry. We don’t have to go."
"10","Bernadette: But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us."
"10","Howard: How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home."
"10","Bernadette: Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun."
"10","Howard: Does it sound sexy?"
"10","Bernadette: You just heard me throwing up."
"10","Howard: You bet I did."
"10","Bernadette: You’re so weird."
"10","Howard: You know what’s weird? How turned on you are right now."
"10","Scene: Penny’s car."
"10","Sheldon: You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging."
"10","Penny: Just as challenging?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes."
"10","Penny: As you?"
"10","Penny: Just as challenging as you?"
"10","Sheldon: When we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto"
"10","and headed for the storm cellar."
"10","Penny: Leonard breathes on me, too. It’s not a big deal."
"10","Sheldon: She’s always complaining about people at work."
"10","Penny: Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world."
"10","Sheldon: Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?"
"10","Penny: You know, so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey."
"10","Sheldon: I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind."
"10","Penny: Agreed. Thank you."
"10","Bernadette: That feels great."
"10","Howard: Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?"
"10","Bernadette: Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?"
"10","Howard: It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house."
"10","Bernadette: Lock the door, lock the door."
"10","Howard: We should call the police."
"10","Bernadette: Uh, I left my phone downstairs."
"10","Howard: Damn, so did I."
"10","Bernadette: Wait, I have my iPad."
"10","Howard: What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?"
"10","Bernadette: That’s not helpful."
"10","Howard: You know I rely on humour in times of stress."
"10","Bernadette: Let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny."
"10","Howard: Is that the hot tub?"
"10","Bernadette: Who would use our hot tub?"
"10","Howard: Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think."
"10","Bernadette: Who is it?"
"10","Howard: Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?"
"10","Bernadette: Should we say something to him?"
"10","Howard: Maybe. How ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?"
"10","Bernadette: I meant like, what are you doing here?"
"10","Howard: Nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings."
"10","Amy: Why is nothing easy with him?"
"10","Leonard: Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst."
"10","Amy: I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance."
"10","Leonard: I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed."
"10","Amy: I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into."
"10","Leonard: Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before."
"10","Amy: That’s true."
"10","Leonard: And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?"
"10","Amy: You’re not making me feel better."
"10","Leonard: Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier."
"10","Amy: He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap."
"10","Leonard: Yeah. My record was six."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"10","Bernadette: Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?"
"10","Howard: Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?"
"10","Bernadette: Is someone else here?"
"10","Raj: Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?"
"10","Stuart: What are you doing here?"
"10","Raj: Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here."
"10","Stuart: Did they?"
"10","Raj: Answer the question, what are you doing here?"
"10","Stuart: I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they’re not home."
"10","Bernadette: What?"
"10","Stuart: They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon."
"10","Bernadette: I told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh."
"10","Penny: You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track."
"10","Sheldon: Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?"
"10","Penny: Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car."
"10","Sheldon: If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
"10","Penny: Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream."
"10","Sheldon: Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
"10","Penny: Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?"
"10","Sheldon: Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy."
"10","Penny: You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine."
"10","Raj: Here you go."
"10","Stuart: Thank you."
"10","Raj: Shall we toast?"
"10","Stuart: To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return."
"10","Bernadette: You said you got it back."
"10","Howard: Well, clearly, I lied."
"10","Raj: So how’s your apartment?"
"10","Stuart: Not great. The electricity’s out."
"10","Raj: So why don’t you get it fixed?"
"10","Stuart: I called, and they’re like, pay your bill."
"10","Raj: If you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place."
"10","Stuart: Oh, no. I don’t want to be an inconvenience. You’ve got all your lady friends, and…"
"10","Raj: Actually, I’m single now."
"10","Stuart: What? When did that happen?"
"10","Raj: It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well, their choice, and it’s not okay."
"10","Stuart: Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know."
"10","Raj: Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything."
"10","Bernadette: Why wouldn’t he tell us? Are we bad friends?"
"10","Howard: He’s in our hot tub drinking our wine."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, he deserves to be alone."
"10","Stuart: So you’re back out on the dating scene now?"
"10","Raj: Yeah, yeah, a little."
"10","Stuart: Oh, that must be fun. How’s that going?"
"10","Raj: I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad."
"10","Amy: Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule."
"10","Leonard: No, don’t do that."
"10","Amy: But you did."
"10","Leonard: Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby."
"10","Amy: It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants."
"10","Leonard: Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?"
"10","Amy: Me."
"10","Leonard: And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?"
"10","Amy: Me. It was mittens."
"10","Leonard: And who got him to try a turkey dog?"
"10","Amy: That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand."
"10","Leonard: How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy."
"10","Amy: You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself."
"10","Leonard: Of course you do."
"10","Amy: And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here."
"10","Leonard: Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith."
"10","Scene: An ice-cream parlour."
"10","Penny: Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite."
"10","Sheldon: No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry."
"10","Penny: What about the girl behind the counter?"
"10","Sheldon: Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other."
"10","Penny: Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?"
"10","Sheldon: You are truly wise."
"10","Penny: Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there."
"10","Penny: All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?"
"10","Sheldon: Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone."
"10","Penny: All right."
"10","Sheldon: I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college."
"10","Penny: Not relating. Go on."
"10","Sheldon: I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me."
"10","Penny: Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay."
"10","Sheldon: My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman."
"10","Penny: Oh, that’s awful."
"10","Sheldon: I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first"
"10","one’s traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on."
"10","Penny: Well, what happened with your dad?"
"10","Sheldon: We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
"10","Penny: You poor thing."
"10","Sheldon: Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to."
"10","Penny: And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road."
"10","Penny: Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women."
"10","Sheldon: Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."
"10","Penny: Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well."
"10","Penny: Okay."
"10","Sheldon: That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny."
"10","Penny: Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed."
"10","Raj: I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby."
"10","Stuart: I don’t know. Bernadette’s baby doesn’t have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot."
"10","Howard: Those jets are for my secret spot, not his."
"10","Bernadette: What do you do in there?"
"10","Howard: It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know."
"10","Raj: Well, it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home."
"10","Stuart: Yeah, you’re probably right."
"10","Raj: You coming?"
"10","Stuart: Yeah, just give me a minute."
"10","Raj: Why?"
"10","Stuart: Well, you know how you’re wearing a bathing suit?"
"10","Raj: Yeah?"
"10","Stuart: I kind of went the other way."
"10","Howard: You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!"
"10","Leonard: What do you think?"
"10","Amy: It’s a nice enough spot. You know, if I’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…"
"10","Penny: We’re back."
"10","Amy: Oh, hi. Hi."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Leonard: How you guys doing?"
"10","Penny: We’re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy."
"10","Sheldon: I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule."
"10","Amy: Oh. Really?"
"10","Leonard: Why does she get that? We never got that."
"10","Penny: Do you want him back?"
"10","Leonard: I’m very happy for you."
"10","Sheldon: Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level."
"10","Scene: Amy and Sheldon’s bathroom."
"10","Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?"
"10","Amy: I would love to."
"10","Leonard: Did we really need to be here for this?"
"10","Penny: Call me crazy, but I found it moving."
"10","Series 10 Episode 06 – The Foetal Kick Catalyst"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Penny: Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?"
"10","Leonard: ‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?"
"10","Penny: I got asked to sign autographs there."
"10","Leonard: That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?"
"10","Penny: Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on."
"10","Leonard: When is it?"
"10","Penny: It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it."
"10","Leonard: What? Why not?"
"10","Penny: You just said yourself, it’s sad."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun."
"10","Penny: I don’t know."
"10","Leonard: You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble."
"10","Penny: I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money."
"10","Leonard: Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph."
"10","Penny: Oh, yeah."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over."
"10","Sheldon: We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging."
"10","Amy: You know what I meant."
"10","Sheldon: All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry I mentioned it."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"10","Howard: That’s a kick. That’s an actual kick."
"10","Bernadette: What are you doing?"
"10","Howard: I felt a kick. There’s a baby in there."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it."
"10","Howard: Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby."
"10","Bernadette: Which MIT did you go to?"
"10","Howard: Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!"
"10","Bernadette: Howie, we have time to do all that stuff."
"10","Howard: Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room."
"10","Bernadette: The next person kicking you will be me. Good night."
"10","Howard: Are we even in a good school…? Ow!"
"10","Bernadette: I warned you, and I did it."
"10","Penny: What’s all this?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers."
"10","Penny: Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph."
"10","Leonard: Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature."
"10","Penny: Who’s that?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?"
"10","Penny: Oh, there’s so much I want to change."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck."
"10","Amy: What’s going on here?"
"10","Sheldon: You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch."
"10","Amy: Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
"10","Amy: You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious."
"10","Amy: That’s an odd mix of people."
"10","Sheldon: Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station."
"10","Amy: You never went into that haunted house."
"10","Sheldon: You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station."
"10","Amy: Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises."
"10","Amy: Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have"
"10","expected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised, but as it is, I didn’t know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising."
"10","Sheldon: Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Howard: Hi."
"10","Bernadette: Hey, where you been?"
"10","Howard: Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby."
"10","Raj: Wait till you see the crib we found."
"10","Bernadette: You bought a crib without me?"
"10","Howard: You’re gonna love it."
"10","Raj: Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies."
"10","Bernadette: Sounds expensive."
"10","Howard: Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety."
"10","Raj: Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting."
"10","Howard: But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it."
"10","Bernadette: Fine."
"10","Howard: In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?"
"10","Bernadette: You bought a minivan?"
"10","Howard: It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive."
"10","Raj: Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan."
"10","Bernadette: I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car."
"10","Howard: The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore."
"10","Raj: Then again, he did think you were my husband."
"10","Bernadette: They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
"10","Scene: The Comic-con."
"10","Leonard: Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful."
"10","Penny: Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms."
"10","Leonard: Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour."
"10","Penny: Alright, why not five and ten bucks?"
"10","Leonard: Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it."
"10","Penny: Hey, that guy’s looking over here."
"10","Leonard: Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?"
"10","Penny: I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi."
"10","Guy: Hi. I love your movie."
"10","Penny: Well, thanks."
"10","Guy: It has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in my life."
"10","Penny: Your love confuses me."
"10","Leonard: Would you like an autograph?"
"10","Guy: Sure."
"10","Penny: Okay. Who do I make it out to?"
"10","Guy: Daniel."
"10","Penny: Okay."
"10","Daniel: I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?"
"10","Penny: That did not clear things up."
"10","Leonard: That’ll be four seventy-five."
"10","Daniel: Keep the change."
"10","Leonard: But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good."
"10","Amy: There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."
"10","Amy: Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’."
"10","Sheldon: Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up."
"10","Bert: I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa."
"10","Amy: How old was it"
"10","Bert: It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it."
"10","Sheldon: Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?"
"10","Mrs Petrescu: Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee’s."
"10","Sheldon: She’s learning English from TV."
"10","Mrs Petrescu: TV, good. Now back to you."
"10","Stuart: Hey, guys."
"10","Amy: Hi, Stuart."
"10","Stuart: These are for you."
"10","Amy: Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
"10","Stuart: Nice to meet you."
"10","Mrs Petrescu: Hello."
"10","Bert: Hey."
"10","Stuart: So, what did I miss?"
"10","Bert: Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes."
"10","Mrs Petrescu: 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance."
"10","Stuart: Anybody else coming to this thing?"
"10","Penny: What’s your name?"
"10","Jeff: Jeff."
"10","Jeff: My favourite part is your shower scene."
"10","Penny: Been hearing that a lot today."
"10","Jeff: I even have a screen grab on my phone."
"10","Penny: Yep, there they are."
"10","Leonard: Okay, let’s keep it moving."
"10","Penny: Here you go."
"10","Leonard: Should’ve punched that guy."
"10","Penny: Well, go ahead. He’s right over there."
"10","Leonard: Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?"
"10","Penny: Hello."
"10","Awkward guy: Hi. I like your movies."
"10","Penny: Thank you."
"10","Awkward guy: I saw both of them."
"10","Penny: I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows."
"10","Awkward guy: You think I could get a picture of us?"
"10","Penny: Oh, sure."
"10","Awkward guy: And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?"
"10","Leonard: No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?"
"10","Penny: Leonard…"
"10","Leonard: No, no, no. It’s not okay."
"10","Awkward guy: Who are you?"
"10","Leonard: I’m her husband."
"10","Awkward guy: No, you’re not."
"10","Leonard: I am."
"10","Penny: Yeah, he really is."
"10","Awkward guy: No."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s garage."
"10","Howard: It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future."
"10","Raj: Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk."
"10","Howard: Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?"
"10","Bernadette: I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?"
"10","Howard: You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot."
"10","Raj: No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those."
"10","Howard: Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?"
"10","Bernadette: It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple."
"10","Howard: Yes."
"10","Raj: Yes."
"10","Howard: See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, is it your back?"
"10","Howard: Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room."
"10","Sheldon: So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together."
"10","Bert: I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too."
"10","Amy: Things didn’t work out?"
"10","Bert: I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I’m warning you, hide your good rocks."
"10","Mrs Petrescu: My sister’s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven."
"10","Stuart: Really, no one else is coming?"
"10","Sheldon: This is it. You are the practice round."
"10","Stuart: Practice round? For-for what?"
"10","Amy: Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of."
"10","Sheldon: You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks."
"10","Stuart: So, I’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?"
"10","Sheldon: Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine."
"10","Amy: Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people."
"10","Sheldon: Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild."
"10","Awkward guy: But how did you get her to go out with you?"
"10","Leonard: Well, she moved in across the hall."
"10","Penny: And he started to slowly wear me down."
"10","Leonard: Like a river carves a canyon."
"10","Penny: Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards."
"10","Red-haired guy: Ready to go?"
"10","Awkward guy: Hang on. This guy’s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him."
"10","Red-haired guy: This guy? But he’s wearing a change maker."
"10","Penny: I think it’s hot."
"10","Leonard: That’s right. I’m her change daddy."
"10","Scene: The minivan."
"10","Howard: Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people."
"10","Bernadette: Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time."
"10","Howard: You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan."
"10","Bernadette: Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van."
"10","Howard: You’re right. It sells itself."
"10","Raj: You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride."
"10","Bernadette: I was hoping it’d be quieter."
"10","Howard: If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?"
"10","Bernadette: Soon."
"10","Howard: Why is it taking so long?"
"10","Raj: Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite."
"10","Howard: I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one."
"10","Raj: I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have."
"10","Bernadette: Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van."
"10","Bert: This is the best blintz I’ve ever had."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Thank you."
"10","Bert: It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier."
"10","Stuart: You know what, I, I, I think I’m just gonna go."
"10","Amy: No, Stuart, don’t."
"10","Stuart: No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I’m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?"
"10","Amy: We’re so sorry."
"10","Stuart: I’m always the last one anybody thinks of."
"10","Sheldon: Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority."
"10","Stuart: Bye."
"10","Sheldon: Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out."
"10","Bert: I know how it feels, too."
"10","Sheldon: All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group."
"10","Stuart: Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest."
"10","Bert: Hear, hear."
"10","Amy: Cheers."
"10","Mrs Petrescu: Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience."
"10","Leonard: And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox."
"10","Awkward guy: Oh. Whoa. I didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times."
"10","Leonard: The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up."
"10","Penny: You know, once, I proposed to him."
"10","Leonard: Yeah. I said no."
"10","Red-haired guy: Why?"
"10","Leonard: I just wanted to make her work for it."
"10","Penny: Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later."
"10","Red-haired guy: Hang on. Is she just with you because you’re rich?"
"10","Leonard: She makes more money than I do."
"10","Awkward guy: What? Who are you?"
"10","Sheldon: Do you know what else I love about you?"
"10","Stuart: Hmm?"
"10","Sheldon: Your handwriting is impeccable."
"10","Stuart: Thank you for noticing."
"10","Sheldon: No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker."
"10","Stuart: You know what I love about you?"
"10","Sheldon: Hmm?"
"10","Stuart: You never leave the house without a paper clip."
"10","Sheldon: You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner."
"10","Stuart: I also love how you never use swear words."
"10","Sheldon: You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em."
"10","Amy: Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss."
"10","Series 10 Episode 07 – The Veracity Elasticity"
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
"10","Amy: And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler."
"10","Sheldon: And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…"
"10","Both: Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags."
"10","Sheldon: Hit it."
"10","Howard (singing): For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner."
"10","(singing)"
"10","Raj (singing): What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist."
"10","Together: Fun with flags, fun with flags."
"10","Howard: Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags."
"10","Together: Fun with flags."
"10","Amy: As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band."
"10","Sheldon: Who haven’t learned their place yet."
"10","Amy: We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them."
"10","Amy: So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis."
"10","Sheldon: So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis. (Drumroll) Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me."
"10","(Drumroll)"
"10","(Cut to Penny, Leonard and Bernadette watching in the apartment opposite)"
"10","Amy: Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…"
"10","Penny: I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?"
"10","Leonard: It’s cute, they’re having fun living together."
"10","Penny: Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready."
"10","Bernadette: Actually, it’s been ready for weeks."
"10","Leonard: What do you mean?"
"10","Bernadette: Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule."
"10","Leonard: So, she’s just been lying to him?"
"10","Penny: Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay."
"10","Sheldon: Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now."
"10","Howard: Oh, right. (Drumroll)"
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music."
"10","Howard: Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny."
"10","Raj: We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?"
"10","Amy: It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?"
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress."
"10","Amy: Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone."
"10","Sheldon: So?"
"10","Amy: Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?"
"10","Sheldon: I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack."
"10","Amy: Anyway, how about dinner?"
"10","Sheldon: You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain."
"10","Amy: Thanks, but you don’t have to."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold."
"10","Amy: Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?"
"10","Sheldon: Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?"
"10","Amy: No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?"
"10","Sheldon: I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property."
"10","Scene: The cafeteria."
"10","Howard: I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us."
"10","Leonard: So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?"
"10","Raj: If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?"
"10","Leonard: You’re awful quiet, everything okay?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately."
"10","Howard: Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?"
"10","Sheldon: Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something."
"10","Leonard: I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work."
"10","Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements."
"10","Howard: You heard him, guys, don’t ask."
"10","Sheldon: Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her."
"10","Leonard: Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago."
"10","Sheldon: I don’t understand."
"10","Leonard: She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early."
"10","Sheldon: So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?"
"10","Leonard: Yes."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas."
"10","Raj: Oh my God, that’s who you look like."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it."
"10","Raj: Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."
"10","Howard: And how single are you right now?"
"10","Raj: Eating cake on the toilet single."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her."
"10","Howard: Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face."
"10","Leonard: Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice."
"10","Howard: So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?"
"10","Leonard: Well, of course not."
"10","Howard: So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?"
"10","Leonard: Uh, no."
"10","Howard: I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed."
"10","Leonard: Are you kidding me?"
"10","Howard: See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain."
"10","Scene: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom."
"10","Leonard: Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone."
"10","Sheldon: Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone."
"10","Leonard: I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month."
"10","Sheldon: It’s khoo-vakh."
"10","Leonard: Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo."
"10","Sheldon: No, no, he’s over there."
"10","Leonard: Oh, yeah, there he is."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Penny: So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?"
"10","Amy: Um, it was a drywall problem."
"10","Penny: Oh, no, what happened?"
"10","Amy: Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…"
"10","Penny: Wet wall?"
"10","Amy: Or damp wall, just as bad."
"10","Penny: Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?"
"10","Amy: Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…"
"10","Penny: Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready."
"10","Amy: I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go."
"10","Penny: But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?"
"10","Amy: Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this."
"10","Penny: Oh, don’t worry, I won’t."
"10","Amy: Thanks."
"10","Penny: The woman at the wall store?"
"10","Amy: Let it go."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Are you going to confront Penny?"
"10","Leonard: Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing."
"10","Sheldon: Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk."
"10","Leonard: Oh, my God, I’m going blind."
"10","Penny: Hi."
"10","Amy: Food’s here."
"10","Sheldon: Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?"
"10","Amy: Oh, uh, they’re still working on it."
"10","Sheldon: Interesting. Very interesting."
"10","Penny: Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while."
"10","Sheldon: Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?"
"10","Penny: I did, still a mess."
"10","Sheldon: Leonard?"
"10","s"
"10","Leonard: Yeah?"
"10","Sheldon: jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny? (I don’t understand, is Penny lying?)"
"10","Leonard: jISovbe’ (I don’t know.)"
"10","Amy: Why are you speaking Klingon?"
"10","Sheldon: Why are you speaking English?"
"10","Amy: This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?"
"10","Penny: Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo."
"10","Amy: Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?"
"10","Penny: Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit’s pubossubibuble."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, wait, stop that."
"10","Amy: You stop that."
"10","Sheldon: Dayaj’a’ (Do you understand them?)"
"10","Leonard: ghobe’ (No.)"
"10","Sheldon: Qu’vatlh (Damn it.)"
"10","Penny: Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?"
"10","Leonard: Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused."
"10","Amy: Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks."
"10","Sheldon: How could you lie to me?"
"10","Penny: Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love."
"10","Leonard: Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?"
"10","Penny: What? Tha… That is not true."
"10","Leonard: Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone."
"10","Penny: Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow."
"10","Leonard: You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?"
"10","Penny: Uh, did you notice your key chain?"
"10","Leonard: Where’s Batman?"
"10","Bernadette: Hey."
"10","Penny: Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?"
"10","Bernadette: One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?"
"10","Howard: It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv (Who knows the status of Amy’s apartment?)"
"10","Amy: Everybody stop it with that."
"10","Raj: I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in."
"10","Amy: And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment."
"10","Howard: You’re up, blabby."
"10","Bernadette: Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything."
"10","Amy: I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment."
"10","Sheldon: It’s all right."
"10","Leonard: And?"
"10","Penny: And what? Your wizard robes are next to go."
"10","Raj: Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?"
"10","Sheldon: Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive."
"10","Amy: Are you saying you’d like to live with me?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m open to the possibility."
"10","Penny: Ubamy bube cubool."
"10","Amy: Whatever."
"10","Howard: You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything."
"10","Penny: That’s a great idea."
"10","Leonard: Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den."
"10","Raj: That would be amazing."
"10","Sheldon: Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room."
"10","Leonard: But you won’t be living here."
"10","Sheldon: But that’s my room."
"10","Leonard: You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here."
"10","Penny: Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours."
"10","Everyone: But you won’t be living here."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom."
"10","Amy: Thank you for understanding."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants."
"10","Amy: Good night."
"10","Sheldon: Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?"
"10","Amy: I don’t know. It, it could be."
"10","Sheldon: Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment."
"10","Amy: Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment."
"10","Sheldon: I hate your apartment."
"10","Amy: Sorry, you brought it up?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena."
"10","Amy: It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want."
"10","Sheldon: But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?"
"10","Amy: Yes."
"10","Sheldon: I’m not a child, don’t do that."
"10","Amy: Sorry."
"10","Sheldon: Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that’s soothing."
"10","Scene: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom"
"10","Leonard: Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours."
"10","Penny: Thank you."
"10","Leonard: Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like."
"10","Penny: Okay, but you may feel some discomfort."
"10","Leonard: I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy."
"10","Penny: Do you really mean that?"
"10","Leonard: I really do."
"10","Penny: Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff."
"10","Leonard: Yeah? What are you keeping?"
"10","Penny: That candle and you."
"10","Leonard: What about my robot poster?"
"10","Penny: Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle."
"10","Amy: What’s going on?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom."
"10","Amy: Can it be more of an internal struggle?"
"10","Sheldon: I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow."
"10","Amy: How about if I just don’t breathe at all?"
"10","Sheldon: That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, hey, Sheldon."
"10","Penny: We turned your room into a sex dungeon."
"10","Sheldon (waking up in bed): No."
"10","(waking up in bed)"
"10","Amy: What is happening?"
"10","Scene: The comic book store."
"10","Howard: Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?"
"10","Sheldon: Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?"
"10","Raj: We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless."
"10","Sheldon: Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?"
"10","Leonard: Over my assless chaps you will."
"10","Howard: This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes."
"10","Raj: Do you like living with her?"
"10","Leonard: Do you know what you need to do now?"
"10","Sheldon: Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all."
"10","Amy: Hi."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Amy: What are you doing?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey."
"10","Amy: I understand. I’ll leave you be."
"10","Sheldon: What, you’re familiar with the reference?"
"10","Amy: Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death."
"10","Sheldon: Exactly."
"10","Amy: Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you."
"10","Amy: You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle."
"10","Sheldon: Really?"
"10","Amy: Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink."
"10","Sheldon: Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."
"10","Amy: Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian."
"10","Sheldon: Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy."
"10","Penny: Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room."
"10","Leonard: Wow."
"10","Penny: I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back."
"10","Leonard: No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want."
"10","Penny: Oh, that means so much. I love you."
"10","Leonard: I love you, too."
"10","Leonard: Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny."
"10","Series 10 Episode 08 – The Brain Bowl Incubation"
"10","Scene: Amy’s lab."
"10","Sheldon: How much will it hurt?"
"10","Amy: It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself."
"10","Sheldon: On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off."
"10","Amy: A two."
"10","Sheldon: Eating a whole Altoid?"
"10","Amy: Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to."
"10","Sheldon: No, this is for science. I can be brave for science."
"10","Amy: Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, jiminy, that’s cold."
"10","Amy: Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells."
"10","Sheldon: All right, just warn me before you do it."
"10","Amy: Okay. Three, two, and we’re done."
"10","Sheldon: You tricked me. You didn’t say one."
"10","Amy: It didn’t hurt, did it?"
"10","Sheldon: No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…"
"10","Amy: Okay, fine, one."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The telescope room."
"10","Raj: Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble."
"10","Cleaner: Uh, sorry, I could come back."
"10","Raj: Oh, no, it’s okay. I just found a wobble."
"10","Cleaner: Oh, do I need a mop?"
"10","Raj: It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me."
"10","Cleaner: Oh, well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?"
"10","Raj: Yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce."
"10","Cleaner: What is your name?"
"10","Raj; Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali."
"10","Cleaner: You think it would be more difficult than that?"
"10","Raj: Good point. And you are?"
"10","Cleaner: Oh, uh, Isabella Maria Concepcion."
"10","Raj: Oh, well, nice to meet you."
"10","Isabella: Nice to meet you, too. You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, working here was ten years old."
"10","Raj: Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella."
"10","Isabella: Bueno, um, I’m just going to empty your waste paper basket and then I’ll get out of your way."
"10","Raj: Oh, please, allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories."
"10","Isabella: Thank you."
"10","Raj: You’re welcome."
"10","Isabella: Okay, uh, okay, I have to go."
"10","Raj: Okay."
"10","Isabella: Good luck with your, um, space exploration."
"10","Raj: Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours."
"10","Sheldon: Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?"
"10","Amy: If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful."
"10","Amy: Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network."
"10","Sheldon: I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys."
"10","Amy: These cells come from both of us."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?"
"10","Amy: No reason we can’t start right now."
"10","Sheldon: What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s"
"10","expose it to images of me and you and see who it likes better."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do."
"10","Sheldon: I understand. She’s the mean one, I’m the fun one."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Howard: Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli."
"10","Raj: Oh, no, that’s mine."
"10","Leonard: Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle."
"10","Raj: Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time."
"10","Penny: You’re dating somebody, who is it?"
"10","Raj: What? What are you talking about?"
"10","Penny: You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off."
"10","Howard: No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage."
"10","Raj: That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it."
"10","Penny: All right, fine, don’t tell us."
"10","Raj: There’s nothing to tell."
"10","Penny: All right."
"10","Leonard: How’s that broccoli?"
"10","Raj: It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody."
"10","Penny: Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?"
"10","Raj: Isabella."
"10","Howard: Oh, did you meet her at work?"
"10","Raj: Yes, in the telescope room."
"10","Leonard: Oh, so she’s an astronomer?"
"10","Raj: Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good."
"10","Penny: Well, that’s great, Raj. You must have so much in common."
"10","Raj: Mm-hmm."
"10","Howard: So, when do we meet her?"
"10","Raj: No, no, this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet."
"10","Leonard: Okay, well, good luck with it."
"10","Raj: Thank you."
"10","Penny: How come you never eat broccoli?"
"10","Leonard: I’m married, I don’t have to be attractive."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: You know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years."
"10","Bernadette: Still, I can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells."
"10","Amy: Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit."
"10","Sheldon: Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells."
"10","Bernadette: Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you."
"10","Sheldon: Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab."
"10","Bernadette: I’m running out of ways to act excited."
"10","Amy: So, enough about us, how are things going with you?"
"10","Bernadette: Great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now."
"10","Amy: Good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste."
"10","Bernadette: Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it."
"10","Bernadette: You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise."
"10","Bernadette: Mine has a fully developed immune system."
"10","Sheldon: Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, that’s enough."
"10","Sheldon: Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win."
"10","Scene: A washroom at the university."
"10","Raj: This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before."
"10","Isabella: You’re kidding."
"10","Raj: No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for."
"10","Isabella: It’s okay, you’re allowed to have a cleaning lady."
"10","Raj: Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair."
"10","Isabella: I think that’s called a mommy."
"10","Raj: Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
"10","Isabella: No, not for many years."
"10","Raj: Oh, so, you are unencumbered?"
"10","Isabella: Just me and my son."
"10","Raj: I love kids, how old is he?"
"10","Isabella: Nineteen."
"10","Raj: That’s a cute age. They can do so many things."
"10","Isabella: He’s studying to be a lawyer at UCLA."
"10","Raj: That’s wonderful. A lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common."
"10","Isabella: Yeah, I guess we do."
"10","Raj: Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?"
"10","Isabella: Ay, Rajesh, I think you’re very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don’t have time for dating."
"10","Raj: Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I’m very busy, too."
"10","Isabella: Oh, please don’t take it personal, I think you’re a very nice man."
"10","Raj: I think you’re very nice as well."
"10","Isabella: Thank you for helping me. Good night, Rajesh."
"10","Raj: Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us."
"10","Isabella: Good night, Rajesh."
"10","Raj: Okay. I’ll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I’ll be thinking of you."
"10","Sheldon: Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it."
"10","Amy: I’ve never seen results like this before."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge."
"10","Amy: Aren’t you glad you participated in this?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?"
"10","Amy: Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results."
"10","Sheldon: Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby."
"10","Amy: Make a baby? What are you talking about?"
"10","Sheldon: Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!"
"10","Amy: Sheldon, I’m not ready to have a baby."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field."
"10","Amy: Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up."
"10","Sheldon: I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me."
"10","Amy: Not right now."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get."
"10","Amy: I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today."
"10","Sheldon: Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?"
"10","Raj: Welcome."
"10","Isabella: What is this?"
"10","Raj: Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here."
"10","Isabella: Oh, Rajesh."
"10","Raj: Oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while."
"10","Isabella: Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you, you know I’m working."
"10","Raj: That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall."
"10","Isabella: Well, I suppose that gives me a little time."
"10","Raj: Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland."
"10","Isabella: Oh, really? You made Cuban food?"
"10","Raj: That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?"
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Penny: Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?"
"10","Amy: No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit."
"10","Leonard: Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder."
"10","Penny: Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?"
"10","Amy: Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything."
"10","Leonard: That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus."
"10","Penny: Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here."
"10","Leonard: Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away."
"10","Amy: Hey, you’re talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man."
"10","Penny: Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some."
"10","Leonard: Well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two."
"10","Sheldon: Well, hello."
"10","Amy: Hello."
"10","Sheldon: Would you care for a brandy?"
"10","Amy: I don’t think so."
"10","Sheldon: Good choice, it’s disgusting."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me."
"10","Sheldon: Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs."
"10","Amy: I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here."
"10","Sheldon: Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it."
"10","Amy: Okay, I’ve had enough."
"10","Sheldon: Amy, come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters."
"10","Raj: So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?"
"10","Isabella: Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah’s favourite things."
"10","Raj: I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again."
"10","Isabella: You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you’d like to…"
"10","Howard: Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?"
"10","Raj: Uh."
"10","Isabella: It’s okay. Uh, I should get back to work."
"10","Howard: Hi. Howard Wolowitz."
"10","Isabella: Oh. Isabella Concepcion."
"10","Howard: Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper."
"10","Isabella: You told him I was an astronomer?"
"10","Isabella: I understand. Time to go."
"10","Raj: No, p-please don’t."
"10","Isabella: It’s okay, Rajesh, I’m a grown woman. I don’t have to waste my time with someone who’s embarrassed by me."
"10","Howard: I can keep this, right?"
"10","Raj: Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain."
"10","Isabella: If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?"
"10","Raj: I’m sorry. Honestly, I didn’t think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."
"10","Isabella: I doubt that."
"10","Raj: Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies."
"10","Howard: Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart."
"10","Raj: Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you."
"10","Isabella: You’re very persistent."
"10","Raj: It’s my one move."
"10","Isabella: Okay. This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant."
"10","Raj: Great. Where would you like to go?"
"10","Isabella: Your choice. It can be Pakistani food if you like."
"10","Raj: Excuse me, but I’m Indian."
"10","Isabella: And now you know how it feels."
"10","Penny: So, were you turned on even a little bit?"
"10","Amy: It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman."
"10","Leonard: I’m sorry, is that a yes?"
"10","Amy: No."
"10","Sheldon: Amy, I didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco."
"10","Amy: For God’s sake, you’re ridiculous."
"10","Sheldon: You guys are aroused, right?"
"10","Amy: That was a close one."
"10","Series 10 Episode 09 – The Geology Elevation"
"10","Scene: The cafeteria."
"10","Bert: Thank you very much. Thanks."
"10","Leonard: That is unbelievable. Good for Bert."
"10","Howard: Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant."
"10","Raj: Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy."
"10","Sheldon: Everything is stupid and I want to go home."
"10","Leonard: That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too."
"10","Howard: Ah."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle."
"10","Leonard: How much money did he win?"
"10","Raj: Over half a million dollars."
"10","Leonard: Wow."
"10","Howard: And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under."
"10","Howard: Here he comes."
"10","Leonard: Right. Be polite."
"10","Sheldon: I know how to behave."
"10","Howard: Do you?"
"10","Raj: Hey, congratulations Bert."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, good for you."
"10","Howard: That’s amazing."
"10","Bert: Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn’t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool."
"10","Sheldon: Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story."
"10","Bert: I’ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya."
"10","Sheldon: Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice."
"10","Leonard: I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard."
"10","Sheldon: Well, aren’t you a peach."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Sheldon: Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it."
"10","Leonard: Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant."
"10","Penny: Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny."
"10","Sheldon: Who listens to the radio any more?"
"10","Amy: Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions."
"10","Leonard: They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets."
"10","Penny: You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?"
"10","Sheldon: You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert."
"10","Amy: You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning."
"10","Sheldon: You want me to read a geology paper?"
"10","Amy: Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Howard: You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you."
"10","Bernadette: Who is it?"
"10","Howard: Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking."
"10","Bernadette: Where did you get that?"
"10","Howard: I found him in an old box."
"10","Bernadette: Why would you buy it?"
"10","Howard: I didn’t buy it. I made it."
"10","Bernadette: Last question. What is wrong with you?"
"10","Howard: What’s the big deal?"
"10","Bernadette: Howie, it’s in poor taste."
"10","Howard: No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff."
"10","Remote-control Hawking: Hey good lookin’, want to go for a spin?"
"10","Howard: His eyes also light up in the dark."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Leonard: It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work."
"10","Penny: It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone."
"10","Sheldon: Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why."
"10","Amy: Sounds like the night we had coitus."
"10","Sheldon: I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?"
"10","Penny: Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?"
"10","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"10","Penny: I, I knew the answer. I got excited."
"10","Leonard: Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down."
"10","Sheldon: That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now."
"10","Leonard: Hey, I’m trying to help you."
"10","Sheldon: Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons."
"10","Leonard: You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…"
"10","Howard: Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it."
"10","Raj: This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."
"10","Howard: You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it."
"10","Bernadette: Okay, call him and show him. I dare you."
"10","Howard: I have no problem calling him."
"10","Bernadette: Fine, then do it."
"10","Howard: Fine, I will."
"10","Bernadette: While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher."
"10","Raj: What’s this button do?"
"10","Remote-control Hawking: Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs."
"10","Howard: You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts."
"10","Raj: I laughed because the guy was Leonard."
"10","Scene: The park."
"10","Sheldon: I admire you, Leonard."
"10","Leonard: Really, why?"
"10","Sheldon: You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river."
"10","Leonard: I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head."
"10","Sheldon: How did you deal with it?"
"10","Leonard: I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix."
"10","Sheldon: I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock."
"10","Leonard: Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life."
"10","Sheldon: Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it."
"10","Leonard: Let it fly."
"10","Sheldon: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…"
"10","Amy: What happened?"
"10","Sheldon: I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot."
"10","Leonard: Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot."
"10","Penny: Well, and what happened to you?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine."
"10","Amy: You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop."
"10","Leonard: Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video."
"10","Amy: You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you."
"10","Amy: Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices."
"10","Leonard: You’re up."
"10","Penny: This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off."
"10","Sheldon: Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?"
"10","Penny: I do, your life is fine you big baby."
"10","Sheldon: Maybe you’re right."
"10","Amy: Really?"
"10","Leonard: If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure."
"10","Penny: There you go."
"10","Sheldon: And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases."
"10","Scene: Outside Amy’s lab. Howard knocks on the door."
"10","Amy: What’s up?"
"10","Howard: I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?"
"10","Amy: Yep."
"10","Howard: Do you think this is in poor taste?"
"10","Leonard: Does it spin around and do tricks?"
"10","Howard: Yeah"
"10","Leonard: Then yeah."
"10","Scene: Barry Kripke’s office."
"10","Howard: What do you think?"
"10","Barry: That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom."
"10","Howard: All right, we’re done. It’s offensive."
"10","Sheldon: Top of the afternoon, gentlemen."
"10","Howard: You’re in a good mood."
"10","Sheldon: Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself."
"10","Leonard: Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?"
"10","Raj: Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward."
"10","Sheldon: Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives."
"10","Howard: What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?"
"10","Leonard: I think he might be learning on his own."
"10","Raj: Then the robot uprising has begun."
"10","Sheldon: Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations."
"10","Raj: He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him."
"10","Sheldon: Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved."
"10","Bert: Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great."
"10","Sheldon: Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too."
"10","Bert: You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year."
"10","Sheldon: Really? I didn’t know that."
"10","Bert: So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?"
"10","Sheldon: You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me. (Off) Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again."
"10","(Off)"
"10","Leonard: Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures."
"10","Amy: I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain."
"10","Sheldon: No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain."
"10","Bernadette: I can’t imagine you being violent."
"10","Leonard: It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges."
"10","Sheldon: I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical."
"10","Raj: It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships."
"10","Amy: What about me and Sheldon?"
"10","Raj: Sure."
"10","Leonard: I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has."
"10","Raj: Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money."
"10","Amy: Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks."
"10","Penny: Aw, thank you."
"10","Amy: That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off."
"10","Penny: What?"
"10","Amy: You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot."
"10","Penny: You liked my short hair, right?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject."
"10","Penny: Seriously, none of you liked it?"
"10","Bernadette: I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?"
"10","Penny: You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?"
"10","Bernadette: I think he looks cute."
"10","Howard: And I think you’re cute."
"10","Raj: I think you’re both cute."
"10","Penny: I think I hate all of you nerds."
"10","Scene: A corridor at the university."
"10","Sheldon: Sorry I’m moving slowly."
"10","Leonard: Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this."
"10","Leonard: Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma."
"10","Sheldon: I can’t take this any more. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert."
"10","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"10","Bert: Come in."
"10","Sheldon: All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk."
"10","Bert: What happened to you?"
"10","Sheldon: Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success."
"10","Bert: Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for."
"10","Sheldon: I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened."
"10","Bert: Is it working?"
"10","Sheldon: No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever."
"10","Bert: Well, you know, we’re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution."
"10","Sheldon: We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go."
"10","Bert: Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?"
"10","Sheldon: You know what? This isn’t gonna work."
"10","Bert: Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend."
"10","Sheldon: Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?"
"10","Bert: It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better."
"10","Penny: I can’t believe you punched Bert."
"10","Sheldon: I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it."
"10","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better."
"10","Stephen Hawking (on skype): Hello, Sheldon."
"10","(on skype)"
"10","Sheldon: Professor Hawking."
"10","Hawking: I understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy."
"10","Sheldon: Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool."
"10","Hawking: Don’t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize."
"10","Penny: Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair."
"10","Hawking: It’s fine. I’ve been on The Simpsons."
"10","Sheldon: How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?"
"10","Hawking: I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek."
"10","Leonard: Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care."
"10","Hawking: Don’t waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you’re too brilliant."
"10","Amy: How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?"
"10","Sheldon: I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in."
"10","Hawking: I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool."
"10","Sheldon: What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?"
"10","Leonard: Do not tell Wolowitz."
"10","Amy: Way ahead of you."
"10","Scene: The Ellen Show."
"10","Ellen: A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that’s true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they’re dumb."
"10","Sheldon: Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful."

"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, actually, I would."
"10","Amy: Great, what’d you have in mind?"
"10","Sheldon: Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here."
"10","Amy: Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around."
"10","Sheldon: You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
"10","Amy: Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back."
"10","Sheldon: You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork."
"10","Amy: Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody."
"10","Sheldon: It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny."
"10","Amy: It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
"10","Amy: I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again."
"10","Scene: At the apartment door."
"10","Sheldon: Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now."
"10","Penny: Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone."
"10","Sheldon: What happened to them?"
"10","Penny: Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away."
"10","Leonard: Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool."
"10","Penny: Amy wants me to have it."
"10","Amy: Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it."
"10","Penny: But it’s a picture of you."
"10","Amy: And you."
"10","Penny: But you commissioned it."
"10","Amy: To give to you."
"10","Penny: But you like it so much."
"10","Amy: So do you."
"10","Penny: I seem to be losing."
"10","Leonard: Yes, you do."
"10","Sheldon: You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?"
"10","Penny: Why don’t you keep it?"
"10","Sheldon: That seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
"10","Penny: Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with."
"10","Sheldon: Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?"
"10","Leonard: Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash."
"10","Sheldon: Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."
"10","Leonard: Fine, take the plant."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Bernadette: Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift."
"10","Stuart: Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you’re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond."
"10","Bernadette: A foot massage?"
"10","Stuart: And that’s not me being creepy, that’s for either of you."
"10","Howard: This is very nice Stuart, thank you."
"10","Bernadette: How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?"
"10","Stuart: Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?"
"10","Bernadette: Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby."
"10","Stuart: Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you, but I’m not really sure."
"10","Howard: Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother."
"10","Stuart: That woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol."
"10","Bernadette: I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes."
"10","Stuart: Thank you. And it’s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first."
"10","Howard: When would you move in?"
"10","Stuart: Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I’m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I’m gonna go vacuum."
"10","Bernadette: Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning."
"10","Stuart: Okay, then I’ll dust."
"10","Bernadette: I did that, too."
"10","Stuart: Then I’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors."
"10","Bernadette: Howard just did that."
"10","Howard: Yeah, let him do it."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock."
"10","Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock: Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper."
"10","Sheldon: It’s one of a kind."
"10","Penny: So if it breaks there’d be none of it?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do."
"10","Leonard: So you think you should keep it?"
"10","Sheldon: I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it."
"10","Leonard: Keep the clock, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you."
"10","Penny: Thank you."
"10","Amy: Thank you?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?"
"10","Leonard: Let me guess, you want it."
"10","Sheldon: Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games."
"10","Leonard: You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care."
"10","Sheldon: Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together."
"10","Leonard: Well, now they’re yours."
"10","Penny: Leonard."
"10","Leonard: Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his."
"10","Sheldon: For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?"
"10","Amy: Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?"
"10","Sheldon: It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten."
"10","Leonard: You know what? There is one thing I would like."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, take whatever you want."
"10","Leonard: I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment."
"10","Sheldon: But you don’t even like flags."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, I like this one."
"10","Sheldon: But I designed it."
"10","Leonard: But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price."
"10","Sheldon: But you don’t even understand its symbolism."
"10","Leonard: Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it."
"10","Sheldon: Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted."
"10","Amy: I don’t think you do, but all right."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s dining room."
"10","Bernadette: Stuart, you cooked?"
"10","Howard: How did you know it wasn’t me?"
"10","Bernadette: There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess."
"10","Howard (door bell rings): That’s Raj."
"10","(door bell rings)"
"10","Stuart: You guys relax, I’ll get it. Have some bread while it’s still warm."
"10","Howard: It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne."
"10","Bernadette: You have a Batsuit."
"10","Howard: It’s pajamas, there’s no cape."
"10","Stuart: Hey, Raj."
"10","Raj: Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?"
"10","Stuart: Oh, I’m living here again."
"10","Raj: Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?"
"10","Stuart: No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help."
"10","Raj: Okay, cool."
"10","Stuart: Anyway, come on in, dinner’s ready."
"10","Raj: Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout."
"10","Stuart: Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that."
"10","Leonard: Is the Wi-Fi working for you?"
"10","Penny: Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets."
"10","Leonard: Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password."
"10","Penny: Are you sure?"
"10","Leonard: Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs."
"10","Penny: What a jerk."
"10","Leonard: You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?"
"10","Penny: Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back."
"10","Sheldon: Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too."
"10","Sheldon: If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned."
"10","Leonard: All right, I tried."
"10","Sheldon: All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn."
"10","Amy: I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?"
"10","Sheldon: It’s a good thing you’re cute."
"10","Raj: So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that."
"10","Stuart: Oh, I know a CPR instructor who’ll come to the house."
"10","Howard: That’d be great."
"10","Stuart: I’ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day."
"10","Stuart: You just kick back and relax, I’ve got it all under control."
"10","Raj: Although it was already under control."
"10","Stuart: I’m sorry, you mumbled something?"
"10","Raj: It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help."
"10","Stuart: Well, you know what they say, it takes a village."
"10","Raj: Well, they already had a village."
"10","Stuart: I noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together."
"10","Raj: Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival."
"10","Stuart: You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We’ll pass, thank you."
"10","Bernadette: Do something, Batman."
"10","Scene: The laundry room."
"10","Leonard: Hey."
"10","Sheldon: What do you think you’re doing?"
"10","Leonard: Separating my delicates."
"10","Sheldon: This is the level you’re stooping to."
"10","Leonard: No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadett’s house."
"10","Stuart: Hey, what’s up?"
"10","Raj: I’m here to put the crib together."
"10","Stuart: Ooh, sorry, I already did it."
"10","Raj: Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib."
"10","Stuart: Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com"
"10","Raj: Why are you being like this?"
"10","Stuart: Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful."
"10","Raj: Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along."
"10","Stuart: Why can’t there be four wheels?"
"10","Raj: Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?"
"10","Stuart: Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing."
"10","Raj: Thank you."
"10","Stuart: If you’re hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Penny: I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?"
"10","Leonard: No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?"
"10","Strange old man: Hey, how you doing?"
"10","Leonard: Uh, can I help you?"
"10","Strange old man: I don’t think so, but you’re sweet for asking."
"10","Penny: What, what are you doing in our apartment?"
"10","Strange old man: Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy."
"10","Leonard: Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here."
"10","Sheldon: So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?"
"10","Sheldon: My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night."
"10","Theodore: It’s like the ’40s again."
"10","Sheldon: Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them."
"10","Penny: All right, Sheldon, this is over the line."
"10","Sheldon: That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID."
"10","Theodore: Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I’m O-negative."
"10","Sheldon: And now you know as much about him as I do."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s living room."
"10","Raj: Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?"
"10","Bernadette: Great, go with the giraffes."
"10","Stuart: Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras."
"10","Stuart: Good choice, boss."
"10","Raj: At least my nose is naturally brown."
"10","Bernadette: Hey, could you please go to the market for me?"
"10","Howard: Get Stuart or Raj to do it."
"10","Bernadette: Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you."
"10","Howard: Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them."
"10","Bernadette: Please just go to the store."
"10","Howard: Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?"
"10","Raj (off): Me"
"10","(off)"
"10","Stuart (off): I’ll do it."
"10","Bernadette: Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails."
"10","Penny: What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?"
"10","Leonard: And just leave him here alone?"
"10","Penny: Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive."
"10","Leonard: Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?"
"10","Theodore: Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought."
"10","Leonard: This is ridiculous."
"10","Theodore: I like the painting. Is that your mom?"
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, get out here."
"10","Sheldon: Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?"
"10","Leonard: We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me."
"10","Leonard: Because you were being selfish."
"10","Sheldon: Dividing our belongings is difficult."
"10","Leonard: Why? I said I didn’t care."
"10","Theodore: Excuse me. It’s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you."
"10","Theodore: Well, I’m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another."
"10","Amy: I think he might be right. Also, who is that?"
"10","Sheldon: I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be."
"10","Leonard: Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone."
"10","Theodore: If you’re looking for a new guy to live with."
"10","Leonard: No."
"10","Penny: We’re good, thank you."
"10","Amy: So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay."
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions."
"10","Leonard: Well, I’d like that, too."
"10","Sheldon: In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals."
"10","Leonard: You promise?"
"10","Sheldon: I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well."
"10","Theodore: Well if we’re rubbing genitals on things, that’s where I shine."
"10","Penny: Little lower to the left. A little more."
"10","Leonard: Good?"
"10","Penny: No, still hideous."
"10","Leonard: Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there."
"10","Penny: Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."
"10","Theodore: I think it brings the room together."
"10","Howard: Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?"
"10","Raj: I’ll do it."
"10","Stuart: Why do you get to do it? I’m the artist."
"10","Raj: Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist."
"10","Stuart: Just because I look sickly doesn’t mean I’m starving."
"10","Bernadette (off): Howard!"
"10","Howard: Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants."
"10","Bernadette: I think I’m in labour."
"10","Howard: Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan."
"10","Stuart: I’ll get the hospital bag."
"10","Raj: I’ll pull the van up."
"10","Stuart: Meet you outside in 2 minutes."
"10","Raj: Team Baby, go."
"10","Howard: I love you."
"10","Bernadette: I love you, too."
"10","Stuart: Are we hugging or having a baby? Let’s go."

"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s van."
"10","Howard: Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin’ okay?"
"10","Bernadette: Here comes another contraction."
"10","Stuart: Let’s pick it up."
"10","Raj: All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs."
"10","Howard: Stop that, this isn’t India."
"10","Raj: Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?"
"10","Howard: Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you."
"10","Raj: I love you, too. We’re good."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom."
"10","Sheldon: Amy? Wake up."
"10","Amy: What’s wrong?"
"10","Sheldon: It’s midnight. Happy birthday."
"10","Amy: Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning."
"10","Sheldon: This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies."
"10","Amy: I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?"
"10","Sheldon: A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped."
"10","Amy: I love it. Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you."
"10","Amy: Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities."
"10","Amy: Is that okay?"
"10","Sheldon: I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing."
"10","Amy: You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery."
"10","Penny (off): Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby."
"10","(off)"
"10","Leonard (off): Come on, we’re going to the hospital."
"10","Amy: I guess, I guess we should stop."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals."
"10","Scene: A delivery room."
"10","Midwife: Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?"
"10","Howard: I’m the father."
"10","Midwife: Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?"
"10","Howard: No idea. Ask him."
"10","Raj: 12 minutes."
"10","Midwife: 12 minutes? Why are you here?"
"10","Stuart: Aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?"
"10","Midwife: This is a hospital, not the airport."
"10","Bernadette: I’m sorry. It’s our first time."
"10","Midwife: It’s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we’re having?"
"10","Howard: No, we’re keeping it a surprise."
"10","Midwife: Old school. Nice."
"10","Bernadette: Not that old school. He knows."
"10","Raj: You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek."
"10","Howard: And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy."
"10","Midwife: Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour."
"10","Raj: I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?"
"10","Midwife: I’m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Penny: Sheldon, what took you so long?"
"10","Sheldon: Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish."
"10","Leonard: Damn, I need my inhaler."
"10","Amy: Just don’t smoke."
"10","Leonard: No, I went down the stairs too fast."
"10","Penny (answering phone): Hey."
"10","(answering phone)"
"10","Raj: Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home."
"10","Penny: Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?"
"10","Bernadette: We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted."
"10","Penny: Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while."
"10","Amy: Well, first deliveries can be slow."
"10","Sheldon: I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid."
"10","Leonard: I found it, but it’s empty."
"10","Penny: Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now."
"10","Leonard: Are you sure? I’d really like to."
"10","Amy: Well, should we, uh, head back up?"
"10","Penny: Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?"
"10","Amy: Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?"
"10","Sheldon: It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide."
"10","Penny: Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun."
"10","Amy: Uh."
"10","Penny: We could go to a bar."
"10","Amy: Well."
"10","Leonard: Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex."
"10","Penny: Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!"
"10","Sheldon: That’s a bit childish, isn’t it?"
"10","Penny: I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?"
"10","Sheldon: Grape. I find it the most mild."
"10","Penny: All right, well, you two go have fun."
"10","Leonard: If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky."
"10","Penny: Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Bernadette: Do you really need to record this?"
"10","Raj: You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t."
"10","Howard: All right, enough with the camera."
"10","Raj: Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this."
"10","Howard: I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?"
"10","Raj: I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!"
"10","Stuart: You’re doing great."
"10","Bernadette: Raj."
"10","Raj: Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language."
"10","Bernadette: How could you?"
"10","Howard: We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it."
"10","Raj: Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it."
"10","Stuart: You told me it was a girl, and I didn’t say it."
"10","Raj: You were supposed to keep that to yourself."
"10","Stuart: Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard."
"10","Amy: So, where were we?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle."
"10","Amy: Well, shall we start over?"
"10","Sheldon: Very well."
"10","Sheldon: I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels."
"10","Amy: Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them."
"10","Amy: And the mood continues to change."
"10","Sheldon: No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this."
"10","Amy: Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track."
"10","Sheldon: Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?"
"10","Amy: No."
"10","Sheldon: Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…"
"10","Amy: It’s not about trains."
"10","Sheldon: Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?"
"10","Amy: Stop talking about trains."
"10","Sheldon: Who’s killing the mood now?"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Leonard: Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?"
"10","Penny: Well, I didn’t until I heard that."
"10","Leonard: Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay."
"10","Raj (off): Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again."
"10","Penny: Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away."
"10","Raj: You’re gonna have to be quieter than that."
"10","Sheldon: Can I look yet?"
"10","Amy: One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter."
"10","Sheldon: Wowza."
"10","Amy: I got a Gryffindor robe for you."
"10","Sheldon: What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me."
"10","Amy: I did. Am I in trouble?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me."
"10","Amy: Wait, what just happened?"
"10","Sheldon: You know I’ve been wanting to go."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry."
"10","Amy: Ooh. Happy birthday to me."
"10","Raj (off): Hello."
"10","Amy: Is this about the baby?"
"10","Raj: No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go."
"10","Amy: Good. Then you’re used to this."
"10","Penny: Hey, Bernadette’s water broke."
"10","Leonard: Come on, everyone to the hospital."
"10","Amy: You have got to be kidding me."
"10","Howard: Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little."
"10","Stuart: I’m not an old man, I just can’t see at night."
"10","Bernadette: Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right."
"10","Stuart: All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call ’em out."
"10","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"10","Penny: Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?"
"10","Amy: :21,369 –> 00:12:23,536"
"10","Yeah, but I thought this"
"10","baby was supposed to ruin their sex life, not mine."
"10","Raj: This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now."
"10","Leonard: Well, it is their child."
"10","Raj: I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous."
"10","Sheldon: Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours."
"10","Raj: And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay."
"10","Amy: I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?"
"10","Sheldon: She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop."
"10","Scene: The delivery suite."
"10","Howard: Deep breaths, slow breaths."
"10","Bernadette: I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips."
"10","Stuart: Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I’ll go get some more."
"10","Howard: Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back."
"10","Stuart: Okay."
"10","Howard: So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz."
"10","Bernadette: We could name her after your mom."
"10","Howard: Debbie? No. She hated that name."
"10","Bernadette: Did she have a middle name?"
"10","Howard: Melvina."
"10","Bernadette: Let’s keep thinking."
"10","Howard: Ah. It sucks that she’s not here."
"10","Bernadette: I know."
"10","Howard: Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma."
"10","Bernadette: She did always have candy in her pocket."
"10","Howard: Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm."
"10","Bernadette: I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"
"10","Howard: Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today."
"10","Scene: The waiting room."
"10","Leonard: It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid."
"10","Amy: Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie."
"10","Penny: How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?"
"10","Leonard: It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come."
"10","Stuart: Hmm. You two got married."
"10","Amy: Sheldon and I are living together."
"10","Sheldon: But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds."
"10","Leonard: Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep."
"10","Penny: Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress."
"10","Stuart: Howard went to space."
"10","Amy: Bernadette got her doctorate."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope."
"10","Amy: We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of."
"10","Raj: For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you."
"10","Stuart: What’s your problem?"
"10","Raj: Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile."
"10","Sheldon: I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable."
"10","Stuart: Raj, if it’s any consolation, I’m no better off than I was ten years ago."
"10","Raj: Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store."
"10","Sheldon: Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say."
"10","Raj: Excuse me."
"10","Leonard: Sorry, Stuart."
"10","Stuart: Hey, I’m in a hospital and I’m not the patient. I’m fine."
"10","Howard: Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class."
"10","Bernadette: I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right."
"10","Howard: Do you want me to get the nurse?"
"10","Bernadette: No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off."
"10","Leonard: I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted."
"10","Raj: Hey."
"10","Stuart: Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?"
"10","Penny: You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room."
"10","Raj: Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move."
"10","Penny: Anyone else want to try?"
"10","Stuart: Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?"
"10","Penny: Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."
"10","Raj: I bought the first one, it didn’t fall."
"10","Penny: Here."
"10","Howard: She’s here, the baby’s here."
"10","Penny: Oh!"
"10","Raj: Congratulations."
"10","Amy: How’s Bernadette?"
"10","Howard: Tired, but great. They’re both great."
"10","Penny: Does the baby have a name yet?"
"10","Howard: We have named her Halley."
"10","Penny: – Oh."
"10","Leonard: Oh, like Halley’s comet."
"10","Howard: Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years."
"10","Amy: That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking."
"10","Howard: I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather."
"10","Raj: Really?"
"10","Howard: Of course."
"10","Raj: You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing."
"10","Scene: The hospital nursery."
"10","Penny: Oh, look at all the babies."
"10","Sheldon: Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about."
"10","Leonard; I wonder which one’s Halley."
"10","Amy: Kind of hard to see the names."
"10","Penny: Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette."
"10","Amy: They all look the same to me."
"10","Raj: Guys, she’s my goddaughter, I think I’ll know when I see her. That one."
"10","Amy: Well, that was quite a day."
"10","Sheldon: It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius."
"10","Amy: I was afraid you’d be too tired."
"10","Sheldon: Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay, I don’t know what is."
"10","Series 10 Episode 12 – The Holiday Summation"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Penny: Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s."
"10","Penny: Yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore."
"10","Leonard: Well, he doesn’t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter."
"10","Penny (checking phone): Oh. It’s Bernadette. She says they’re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard."
"10","(checking phone)"
"10","Leonard: Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Amy: Hi."
"10","Penny: Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating."
"10","Amy: It was not a great trip."
"10","Penny: Well, you’re home now."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?"
"10","Penny: I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Leonard: Did you at least have a good flight down there?"
"10","Sheldon: It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way."
"10","Penny: So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?"
"10","Leonard: And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice."
"10","Sheldon: Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…"
"10","Flashback."
"10","Sheldon: How did we get in the car?"
"10","Back to apartment."
"10","Leonard: Hold on. How did you get him in the car?"
"10","Amy: I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
"10","Amy: So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together."
"10","Sheldon: Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture."
"10","Amy: Maybe there won’t be one."
"10","Sheldon: There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it."
"10","Amy: Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it."
"10","Sheldon: Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower."
"10","Penny: Do boys have flowers?"
"10","Leonard: Who knows what he has down there."
"10","Penny: Mm."
"10","Sheldon: Anyway…"
"10","Mary: Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen."
"10","Sheldon: Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?"
"10","Mary: You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you’re in a church with a guitar."
"10","Amy: Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious."
"10","Mary: Oh, it’s my pleasure. Mm. I’m so glad y’all could make it. So, tell me, what’s going on back home?"
"10","Amy: Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby."
"10","Mary: Oh, that’s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?"
"10","Sheldon: Welcome to Texas."
"10","Amy: They haven’t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes."
"10","Mary: Come on, Shelly, tell me your news."
"10","Sheldon: All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not."
"10","Mary: Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled."
"10","Sheldon: What? Wh, where’s the judgment? Wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there."
"10","Mary: Obviously, I would prefer if you weren’t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I’m very happy for you."
"10","Sheldon: And what special circumstances are those?"
"10","Penny: Oh, boy, I think it’s about to get bad."
"10","Mary: Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them."
"10","Sheldon: What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?"
"10","Mary: No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there’d be nurses."
"10","Sheldon: Well, this is highly insulting."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, don’t overreact."
"10","Sheldon: I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato."
"10","Amy: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"10","Mary: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"10","Penny: What?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I was in my room, I couldn’t hear what they were saying."
"10","Amy: I’ll take over from here."
"10","Amy: He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?"
"10","Mary: He’s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him."
"10","Amy: Are you going to?"
"10","Mary: Oh, heck no."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, what, what are you doing?"
"10","Sheldon: Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was."
"10","Mary: You startin’ to see why I didn’t go in there? Sheldon, if you’re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain’t changing my mind."
"10","Amy: We’re ignoring the fins, okay."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too."
"10","Amy: I don’t think that’s what she’s saying."
"10","Sheldon: And?"
"10","Amy: That’s exactly what she was saying."
"10","Sheldon: Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?"
"10","Leonard: Absolutely not."
"10","Penny: That’s too loud."
"10","Amy: Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while."
"10","Sheldon: Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out."
"10","Amy: You know, I’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone."
"10","Sheldon: You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard’s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…"
"10","Amy: What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?"
"10","Sheldon: I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy."
"10","Amy: Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip."
"10","Sheldon: I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place."
"10","Amy: She was gonna find out eventually."
"10","Sheldon: Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were."
"10","Sheldon: Why would you do that?"
"10","Amy: This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you."
"10","Sheldon: You managed the situation?"
"10","Amy: That’s right."
"10","Sheldon: So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life."
"10","Amy: Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you."
"10","Sheldon: I have gotten much better at that."
"10","Amy: Have you? How am I feeling right now?"
"10","Sheldon: What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter."
"10","Amy: You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine."
"10","Sheldon: How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?"
"10","Amy: Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?"
"10","Sheldon: Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years."
"10","Bernadette: Hi."
"10","Howard: Hey, guys."
"10","Leonard: Hey."
"10","Penny: Hi. There’s the little family!"
"10","Raj: Hello."
"10","Stuart: Hello."
"10","Leonard: And their Sherpas."
"10","Howard: The baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?"
"10","Penny: Yeah. Go ahead."
"10","Amy: Do you need help?"
"10","Howard: No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me."
"10","Bernadette: Sorry we’re late."
"10","Penny: Oh, it’s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah. Here. I’ll catch you up."
"10","Penny: Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head."
"10","Leonard: On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school."
"10","Sheldon: I was acting odd intentionally."
"10","Bernadette: Really? So you can control it?"
"10","Penny: Okay. Then what happened?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) My mother made me take it out. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) Amy put alcohol on it. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) And here we are."
"10","(Flashback to Sheldon screaming.)"
"10","Howard: What did we miss?"
"10","Bernadette: I couldn’t explain it if I tried."
"10","Scene: The same, later."
"10","Penny: So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?"
"10","Amy: Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet."
"10","Howard: So what did you and Leonard do?"
"10","Penny: Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight."
"10","Leonard: It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had."
"10","Raj: Oh, my God, what happened?"
"10","Leonard: Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me."
"10","Bernadette: It’s like I was excited for a present and got socks."
"10","Stuart: I don’t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life."
"10","Sheldon: I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks."
"10","Penny: To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree."
"10","Howard: What happened"
"10","Penny: You do make a cute elf."
"10","Leonard: Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con."
"10","Penny: Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree."
"10","Leonard: Oh cool, I’ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan."
"10","Time lapse."
"10","Leonard: Stupid idea."
"10","Penny: No, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go."
"10","Leonard: For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!"
"10","Penny: Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens."
"10","Leonard: You know how easily I blister."
"10","Penny: Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit."
"10","Leonard: Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening."
"10","Penny: Fine."
"10","Leonard: Thank you."
"10","Penny: Leonard?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah."
"10","Penny: There’s something on the windshield."
"10","Flash forward to the stairwell."
"10","Penny: You need a break?"
"10","Leonard: Do not need a break."
"10","Penny: There’s no shame in asking for a break."
"10","Leonard: If I need a break, I’ll ask for a break."
"10","Flash forward."
"10","Penny: Ugh. Leonard?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah?"
"10","Penny: There’s a tree on you."
"10","Leonard: You want to decorate it tonight?"
"10","Penny: Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure."
"10","Leonard (hearing animal noises): I hope it kills us both."
"10","(hearing animal noises)"
"10","Leonard: By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it."
"10","Sheldon: So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?"
"10","Bernadette: Sure."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, how’s life with your baby?"
"10","Amy: Really? You’re never gonna touch their baby?"
"10","Sheldon: To this day I’ve never touched Stuart."
"10","Bernadette: It’s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, please stop crying, I’m begging you. I don’t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. Shh. What have we done?"
"10","Howard: Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies."
"10","Bernadette: It took me two hours to get her down."
"10","Raj: You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always, sometimes we’d leave."
"10","Howard: Hey, he got her to stop."
"10","Bernadette: That was so fast."
"10","Raj: Oh, he’s really good with her."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, he has a gift."
"10","Howard: What’s the matter?"
"10","Bernadette: Nothing, these are happy tears."
"10","Howard: Oh, good."
"10","Bernadette: No they’re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can’t?"
"10","Howard: I mean, it’s Stuart. Maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away."
"10","Bernadette: Not funny."
"10","Raj: She’s tired, that was funny."
"10","Bernadette: Everyone’s a better mom than me."
"10","Raj: Oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk."
"10","Sheldon: Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?"
"10","Amy: Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?"
"10","Leonard: Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?"
"10","Stuart: Oh, I just talked to her. I’ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep."
"10","Penny: You poor things you must be exhausted."
"10","Howard: It has been hard to sleep with all the crying."
"10","Bernadette: How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine."
"10","Howard: She doesn’t hate you, stop saying that."
"10","Bernadette: Now you hate me too."
"10","Howard: Shh, I don’t hate you."
"10","Sheldon: It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you, Sheldon, I’m feeling better now."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you, Internet. I’m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy."
"10","Penny: So things started to turn around?"
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep."
"10","Leonard: Please tell me you didn’t use Amy’s magic juice."
"10","Howard: Bernie?"
"10","Bernadette: Shh. She’s asleep."
"10","Howard: Great. And where are you?"
"10","Bernadette: Down here."
"10","Howard: Oh. This is new."
"10","Bernadette: I didn’t know what else to do. It worked."
"10","Howard: Well, I’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on."
"10","Bernadette: Don’t make me laugh."
"10","Howard: Do you need help getting out?"
"10","Bernadette: I think I live here now. It’s fine."
"10","Howard: Is it okay if I get some sleep?"
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, go ahead."
"10","Howard: Good job, Mommy. I’m proud of you."
"10","Bernadette: Don’t make me cry, either."
"10","Howard: Good night. I love both my girls."
"10","Bernadette: We love you, too."
"10","Penny: I can’t believe you fit in the crib."
"10","Bernadette: I could take a bath in the sink. I don’t, but I can."
"10","Raj: So how were your holidays?"
"10","Stuart: Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She’s in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go… oh come on."
"10","Amy: That was fun, thank you."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, thanks."
"10","Penny: Our pleasure."
"10","Leonard: See you guys at work."
"10","Raj: Be there bright and early."
"10","Howard: Not me, paternity leave."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off."
"10","Howard: With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this."
"10","Series 10 Episode 13 – The Romance Recalibration"
"10","After a previously on sequence."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Penny: What, what’s all this?"
"10","Leonard: Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice."
"10","Penny: Oh, that is so thoughtful."
"10","Leonard: Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?"
"10","Penny: Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it."
"10","Leonard: and this wine is why."
"10","Penny: Oh. Hey, what smells so good?"
"10","Leonard: I made your favourite. Pizza bagels."
"10","Penny: Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you."
"10","Leonard: Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself."
"10","Penny: Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this."
"10","Leonard: Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep."
"10","Penny: You did not just quote an Nsync song."
"10","Leonard: I quoted your favourite Nsync song."
"10","Penny: Oh."
"10","Out of daydream sequence."
"10","Leonard: Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?"
"10","Leonard: Why?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives."
"10","Leonard: That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half."
"10","Sheldon: That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?"
"10","Leonard: Are you gonna laugh at the answer?"
"10","Sheldon: Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes."
"10","Leonard: If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall."
"10","Leonard: So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night."
"10","Sheldon: At our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?"
"10","Leonard: Because we just spent our allowance on comic books."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?"
"10","that"
"10","Penny: I hadn’t really thought about it."
"10","Amy: But now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that."
"10","Bernadette: Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?"
"10","Amy: Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him."
"10","Bernadette: I’ve been seeing him for years, I’m still not convinced he’s real."
"10","Penny: Hey, can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?"
"10","Bernadette: Uh oh, what’s going on?"
"10","Penny: Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants."
"10","Bernadette: It’s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now."
"10","Amy: Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up."
"10","Penny: Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more."
"10","Amy: Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Howard: All right, got Halley to sleep."
"10","Raj: Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby."
"10","Howard: Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room."
"10","Raj: Have you tried anything to fix it?"
"10","Howard: Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help."
"10","Raj: I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?"
"10","Howard: Did try nailing a couple of the boards down."
"10","Raj: Did that do anything?"
"10","Howard: Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug."
"10","Sheldon: If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move."
"10","Leonard: Oh, no. Good game."
"10","Penny: Hey."
"10","Leonard: Hey."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?"
"10","Penny: Oh, it was fine."
"10","Sheldon: Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?"
"10","Penny: Uh, chips."
"10","Sheldon: Anything to drink?"
"10","Penny: Some wine."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here."
"10","Leonard: Just ignore him."
"10","Penny: Hm. At least he took an interest."
"10","Leonard: What’s that supposed to mean?"
"10","Penny: Nothing."
"10","Leonard: Hey, what’s going on with you?"
"10","Penny: I don’t want to talk about it."
"10","Leonard: Well, hey, come on, just tell me."
"10","Penny: Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted."
"10","Leonard: What? Where is this coming from?"
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips."
"10","Penny: It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more."
"10","Leonard: That is ridiculous."
"10","Penny: This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it."
"10","Leonard: No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?"
"10","Penny: Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."
"10","Leonard: Fine, go ahead."
"10","Sheldon: Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense."
"10","Bernadette (on phone): Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing."
"10","Bernadette (on phone):"
"10","Howard: That sounds expensive."
"10","Raj: Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do."
"10","Howard: MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager."
"10","Raj: Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?"
"10","Howard: No."
"10","Raj: Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?"
"10","Bernadette: I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?"
"10","Howard: Is that supposed to be funny?"
"10","Raj: Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny."
"10","Penny: All right, we’re heading out."
"10","Leonard: Mm-hmm."
"10","Amy: I’ll call you when we get to the hotel."
"10","Sheldon: And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?"
"10","Amy: I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower."
"10","Leonard: Have fun."
"10","Penny: Thanks. Are you ready?"
"10","Amy: Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained."
"10","Leonard: Go ahead, it’s fine."
"10","Sheldon: Bye."
"10","Amy: Bye."
"10","Leonard: Okay."
"10","Penny: Let’s go."
"10","Amy: I’ll miss you."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, I’ll miss you too."
"10","Amy: I’ll miss you more."
"10","Sheldon: Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one."
"10","Amy: If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…"
"10","Leonard: Thank you."
"10","Scene: The apartment, later."
"10","Sheldon: Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea."
"10","Leonard: Thanks."
"10","Sheldon: And it’s just the way you like it."
"10","Leonard: Earl grey?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes."
"10","Leonard: Honey?"
"10","Leonard: Unsweetened almond…"
"10","Sheldon: Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it."
"10","Leonard: Sorry, thank you."
"10","Sheldon: Well, what can we do to cheer you up?"
"10","Leonard: I really don’t know."
"10","Sheldon: You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?"
"10","Leonard: I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in."
"10","Leonard: Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable."
"10","Sheldon: Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s nursery."
"10","Howard: Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib."
"10","Raj: It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons."
"10","Howard: Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster."
"10","Raj: Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down."
"10","Howard: Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it."
"10","Raj: It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well."
"10","Howard: Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square."
"10","Raj: Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?"
"10","Howard: It’s a tradition of my people. (Singing) If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum."
"10","(Singing)"
"10","Raj: Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song."
"10","Scene: Leonards car."
"10","Sheldon: Would you like to play a driving game I invented?"
"10","Leonard: Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?"
"10","Sheldon: Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?"
"10","Leonard: I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out."
"10","Sheldon: Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different."
"10","Leonard: I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got."
"10","Scene: The spa."
"10","Penny: When was the last time you got a massage?"
"10","Amy: Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away."
"10","Penny: Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade."
"10","Amy: I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?"
"10","Penny: Well, yeah."
"10","Amy: Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes."
"10","Penny: What are you doing here?"
"10","Leonard: I came here to apologize."
"10","Penny: Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself."
"10","Leonard: Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort."
"10","Sheldon: Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you."
"10","Amy: Nice to see you, too."
"10","Sheldon: And that’s how you make effort look effortless."
"10","Penny: All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?"
"10","Leonard: I don’t understand what you want."
"10","Penny: I’m trying to figure it out."
"10","Sheldon: You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?"
"10","Sheldon: Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk."
"10","Howard: So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,"
"10","once you get the hang of it. Step. Step. Hop onto Ottoman."
"10","Raj: Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck."
"10","Howard: Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea."
"10","Bernadette: You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark."
"10","Raj: Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed."
"10","Howard: Bigger problems, I felt something pop."
"10","Sheldon: There’s a cucumber in my water."
"10","Amy: Uh-huh."
"10","Sheldon: Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?"
"10","Amy: It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing."
"10","Sheldon: Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh."
"10","Sheldon: Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?"
"10","Penny: We’re not getting divorced."
"10","Leonard: Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple."
"10","Penny: Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um."
"10","Leonard: Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule."
"10","Penny: Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance."
"10","Leonard: What do you say?"
"10","Sheldon: I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started."
"10","Penny (after Amy laughs): Do you really think that’s funny?"
"10","(after Amy laughs)"
"10","Amy: It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh."
"10","Sheldon: If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed."
"10","Penny: Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs."
"10","Leonard: Does it really need to say that?"
"10","Sheldon: I did this for free, let me get a little something."
"10","Leonard: Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it."
"10","Penny: I think this all looks good."
"10","Leonard: Me, too."
"10","Sheldon: Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition."
"10","Amy: I remember signing our first relationship agreement."
"10","Sheldon: Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause."
"10","Amy: Right, right. Got it."
"10","Series 10 Episode 14 – The Emotion Detection Automation"
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Leonard: What’s going on with that woman you’re dating?"
"10","Raj: I broke up with her."
"10","Leonard: Why?"
"10","Raj: She said she didn’t want to see me any more and I found that insulting."
"10","Howard: I thought things were going well. What happened?"
"10","Raj: I don’t know, she didn’t even give me a reason."
"10","Sheldon: That’s not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?"
"10","Raj: Can we not play this game?"
"10","Sheldon: Doesn’t like games. That’s one."
"10","Leonard: Ignore him. Yeah, sorry about the breakup."
"10","Raj: That’s okay, I’m fine."
"10","Sheldon: Of course you’re fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made."
"10","Raj: I’m not a virgin, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: So now you think you’re better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women don’t like you."
"10","Leonard: You’re not being very nice."
"10","Sheldon: What? He said he was fine."
"10","Howard: Sometimes people say things they don’t mean."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, that’s a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said."
"10","Leonard: Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey."
"10","Penny: Hey, boys. How’s it going?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive."
"10","Bernadette: So, normal."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, what did you do?"
"10","Sheldon: We were discussing Raj’s recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him."
"10","Raj: It’s okay, I’m fine."
"10","Sheldon: Don’t fall for it. He’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy."
"10","Raj: Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn’t want to talk about it any more."
"10","Sheldon: Then why didn’t you say that?"
"10","Howard: Because that’s not what people do."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind."
"10","Penny: No. No, you don’t, you really don’t. I actually can’t say don’t enough."
"10","Sheldon: Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues."
"10","Amy: I’m sure it’s extremely frustrating."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you."
"10","Amy: And also a little sad."
"10","Sheldon: Okay, now you’re just showing off."
"10","Bernadette: You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions."
"10","Leonard: And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool."
"10","Bernadette: It’s supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time."
"10","Penny: Wow, I find that hard to believe."
"10","Leonard: That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?"
"10","Penny: I take it back. I believe it."
"10","Howard: You if it’s at MIT, I can make some calls. Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype."
"10","Amy: What do you think?"
"10","Sheldon: A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend."
"10","Bernadette: Wouldn’t that be nice."
"10","Sheldon: It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them."
"10","Bernadette: I like the first one."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The comic book store."
"10","Raj: Now that Sheldon’s across the hall, have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?"
"10","Leonard: I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room."
"10","Sheldon: You could make it a train room."
"10","Leonard: I don’t like trains. You like trains."
"10","Sheldon: I know, and Amy says I can’t have a train room."
"10","Howard: Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader. They’re sending a prototype for you to beta test."
"10","Sheldon: Wonderful. Although I’m not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig."
"10","Leonard: Well, when you get the machine, you can find out."
"10","Raj: Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me."
"10","Howard: Well, you don’t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize."
"10","Raj: That’s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what’s wrong with me."
"10","Leonard: No, Raj, that’s a terrible idea."
"10","Howard: Yeah, I was joking."
"10","Sheldon: Really? Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Leonard: Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work."
"10","Penny: Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother’s coming out here in a few weeks."
"10","Leonard: Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What’s going on with your brother?"
"10","Penny: My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work."
"10","Leonard: Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?"
"10","Penny: Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs."
"10","Leonard: Well, I’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he’ll stay?"
"10","Penny: I, I’m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?"
"10","Leonard: Hmm. Who knows? That’s exciting. I’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here."
"10","Penny: You don’t have a problem with this, do you?"
"10","Leonard: Of course not. I mean, he’s your brother."
"10","Penny: Okay. Thank you, you’re the best. Mm."
"10","Leonard: Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both."
"10","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"10","Howard: This thing’s pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate."
"10","Amy: It’s amazing a machine can do that."
"10","Sheldon: Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, they’ll know that I’ve been rooting for them the whole time."
"10","Howard: The display is synced to your phone. Give it a try."
"10","Amy: All right. Now, I’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately."
"10","Howard: Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things you’re feeling, like, what have I done with my life?"
"10","Amy: Okay, I’m looking at the first picture."
"10","Sheldon: You are happy?"
"10","Amy: Yes. I’m looking at puppi"
"10","Sheldon: Aw. Somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right."
"10","Howard: Try another one."
"10","Amy: Okay. What does it say I’m feeling?"
"10","Sheldon: Sad."
"10","Amy: Yes. I’m looking at a picture of my grandma."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her."
"10","Amy: Yes."
"10","Sheldon: And you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you’re mad. Make up your mind."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Raj (on phone): Okay, Emily. Yeah, sounds great. See you then."
"10","(on phone)"
"10","Bernadette: Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?"
"10","Raj: Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend."
"10","Howard: Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?"
"10","Raj: We are going to find out."
"10","Bernadette: Why would you do that, Raj?"
"10","Raj: Well, I want information in order to improve myself."
"10","Bernadette: You’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings."
"10","Raj: Don’t worry, I’m a grown man. I have a thick skin."
"10","Howard: You’re so stupid."
"10","Raj: Hey."
"10","Penny: Hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? I’m trying to help him clean it up a little."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?"
"10","Penny: He didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, Leonard, if you’re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector."
"10","Leonard: How’s it working out?"
"10","Sheldon: Surprisingly well."
"10","Leonard: That’s great, I’m happy for you."
"10","Sheldon: No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Aren’t you sweet?"
"10","Amy: What’s that? Are you working on your resume?"
"10","Penny: No, it’s my brother’s. I’m trying to help him get a job out here."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry."
"10","Leonard: No, it doesn’t."
"10","Sheldon: What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. It’s this red frowny guy on my phone."
"10","Penny: What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?"
"10","Leonard: No."
"10","Sheldon: Yes."
"10","Leonard: I said no."
"10","Sheldon: It’s like you’re twins."
"10","Penny: Leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me."
"10","Leonard: Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first."
"10","Penny: He’s my brother. I didn’t think I needed your permission."
"10","Sheldon: Well, hey. Now she’s angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters."
"10","Leonard: I’m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."
"10","Penny: Like you talked to me about your gaming room?"
"10","Leonard: Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it."
"10","Sheldon: He’s still mad."
"10","Amy: Stop enjoying their fight."
"10","Sheldon: You first."
"10","Penny: If you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when I told you?"
"10","Leonard: Because I didn’t want to sound like a jerk."
"10","Penny: Well, you sound like one now. I don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while."
"10","Leonard: If you get him a job, he’s gonna live here forever!"
"10","Penny: He would get his own place."
"10","Leonard: Has he ever had his own place?"
"10","Penny: Yes."
"10","Leonard: Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?"
"10","Penny: It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?"
"10","Sheldon: Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you."
"10","Penny: You gave me a bill at the end of every month."
"10","Leonard: Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight."
"10","Sheldon: You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings."
"10","Amy: Come on, Sheldon, let’s go."
"10","Sheldon: Gladly. Can we storm out?"
"10","Amy: I think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it."
"10","Sheldon: Fine. I’ll just give them the finger."
"10","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"10","Raj: Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes."
"10","Howard: No, he doesn’t think it’s stupid."
"10","Raj: Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we’ll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior."
"10","Howard: Hey, you went out with him. I didn’t."
"10","Raj: Okay, uh, let’s get things started. Um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?"
"10","Lucy: Oh, okay. Um, I’m Lucy, and I broke up with Raj because I have severe social anxiety, and he kept trying to force me into uncomfortable situations."
"10","Howard: Like this one?"
"10","Lucy: Yeah."
"10","Raj: I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?"
"10","Howard: Schmuck. Got it."
"10","Raj: Uh, next?"
"10","Claire: Okay. Um, I’m Claire. And I guess I broke up with you because you were just really needy. Also, you were incredibly vain, like, all the time you spent shaping your eyebrows."
"10","Raj: Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?"
"10","Emily: Ooh, I’m not sure I’m comfortable sharing details about our relationship in front of Howard."
"10","Raj: Oh. He’s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him."
"10","Emily: Okay. Well, whenever you and I were in bed…"
"10","Raj: Howard, get out."
"10","Howard: Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, dinner’s ready. I made beef loaf, because I know you’re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?"
"10","Sheldon: Not really."
"10","Amy: What’s going on?"
"10","Sheldon: I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings."
"10","Sheldon: It’s more than that. It’s me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
"10","Amy: Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I can’t see without my glasses. And right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge."
"10","Sheldon: I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I’m not."
"10","Amy: Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, but that’s shooting fish in a barrel. You’re kind of a sad sack. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I’m just upset."
"10","Amy: No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And I’m proud of you, for reasons I’m sure have something to do with my father. And if you don’t like that machine, get rid of it. Because I love you exactly the way you are."
"10","Sheldon: I feel the same way about you. Now, put your glasses back on. You look weird."
"10","Howard (translating for other Emily): I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents."
"10","(translating for other Emily)"
"10","Emily: Oh, yeah, that used to drive me nuts. He’s kind of a mama’s boy."
"10","Claire: Kind of?"
"10","Raj: Okay, that’s enough. Write down loving son."
"10","Lucy: Can I just say something? Going out with Raj was one of the best things that ever happened to me."
"10","Raj: Yes, I’ll take you back."
"10","Lucy: Let me finish. It’s like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don’t want in a man."
"10","Raj: Well, that’s hard to hear, but I’ll still take you back."
"10","Emily: You know, the same thing happened to me. After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary, who’s just amazing."
"10","Howard: Sorry, is that Gary with one R or two?"
"10","Raj: Would you stop writing? Wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?"
"10","Lucy: Oh, yeah."
"10","Emily: Without question."
"10","Claire: Little before, actually."
"10","Howard (responding to other Emily): Oh, wow. Don’t let him get away."
"10","(responding to other Emily)"
"10","Raj: What did she say?"
"10","Howard: Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne."
"10","Raj: Okay, maybe we should just end this."
"10","Howard: Wait, hang on. I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. Even at the risk of being humiliated. And I, for one, think that’s very brave."
"10","Raj: Thank you, Howard."
"10","Emily: Honestly, I’m surprised you two didn’t wind up together."
"10","Howard: Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s door."
"10","Sheldon: Yes?"
"10","Leonard: We owe you an apology."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, it’s fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasn’t home, you borrowed a suitcase."
"10","Leonard: That was six years ago. I’m talking about tonight."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order."
"10","Penny: Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
"10","Leonard: And, sorry about the suitcase."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that you’ve resolved your conflict."
"10","Penny: Yes, we’re fine."
"10","Leonard: Mm, Penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for Randall to visit."
"10","Penny: Hopefully, he won’t be too upset."
"10","Leonard: Oh, you’re his little girl, he can’t stay mad at you."
"10","Penny: He won’t be mad at me. I mean, you’re the one who doesn’t want my brother to come, so…"
"10","Leonard: So you’re gonna throw me under the bus?"
"10","Penny: Oh, I’m gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal."
"10","Sheldon: Uh, guys, it sounds like you’re getting angry again."
"10","Leonard: That’s because we are."
"10","Sheldon: Yes. I don’t need an emotion machine. I am one."
"10","Howard: Thanks, ladies, this was fun. Let’s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night."
"10","Raj: Well, that was a waste of time. I’m such an idiot."
"10","Howard: Don’t beat yourself up. That’s what I’m here for."
"10","Raj: Maybe I won’t settle down. Maybe I’ll just play the field."
"10","Howard: Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no."
"10","Raj: Dude, come on."
"10","Howard: Okay, I’ll tell you what. I’ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and Bernadette, you and I can give it a go."
"10","Raj: I appreciate the offer, but if things don’t work out with you two, I’m swooping in on her like a vulture."
"10","Howard: Too late. Stuart called dibs."
"10","Raj: But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? Like, print up announcements?"
"10","Howard: I don’t know. What difference does it make?"
"10","Raj: Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades."
"10","Howard: Those do look fun."
"10","Raj: Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip."
"10","Howard: If you didn’t want me to eat it, why’d you put it out?"
"10","Raj: It was for the girls. They broke up with me, I don’t care if they get fat."
"10","Howard: I’m not gonna get fat."
"10","Raj: Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise."
"10","Howard: Fine. Look, I’ll exercise right now. One, two. These are crunches, by the way."
"10","Raj: Very mature. Keep eating like that, you’re gonna have a heart attack."
"10","Howard: Okay. How about if I eat like this?"
"10","Raj: You’re such a child."
"10","Howard: Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?"
"10","Raj: Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you."
"10","Howard: Please. When you see the ring I pick out, you’re gonna melt."
"10","Raj: Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, don’t tell me, I want to be surprised."
"10","Penny: So, did you wind up sending that machine back?"
"10","Sheldon: I did. You know, I’m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad."
"10","Bernadette: I finally got Halley to sleep."
"10","Raj: You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."
"10","Amy: It’s true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy."
"10","Penny: So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up."
"10","Leonard: We can’t. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, uh, Bernadette, let’s test this theory. What do you think I’m feeling right now?"
"10","Bernadette: Let’s see. You’re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don’t have to be us."
"10","Sheldon: Keep filling this one with babies. She’s good."
"10","Series 10 Episode 15 – The Locomotion Reverberation"
"10","Scene: The laboratory."
"10","Howard: Okay, I’m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel."
"10","Leonard: Nicely done, Howard."
"10","Howard: Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things."
"10","Leonard: Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
"10","Howard: Those are just the things I say out loud."
"10","Sheldon: Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately."
"10","Howard: What’s wrong?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller."
"10","Leonard: That’s great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We’re good to go."
"10","Howard: Yeah. It doesn’t need to be smaller."
"10","Sheldon: Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics."
"10","Leonard: Can we please stop talking about poodles?"
"10","Sheldon: Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do."
"10","Howard: Sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home."
"10","Sheldon: I don’t want to go home."
"10","Leonard: Fine, go for a little walk."
"10","Sheldon: Then what?"
"10","Leonard: Just keep walking."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Leonard: At least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks."
"10","Howard: I know. That’s why I keep refilling his water when he’s not looking."
"10","Leonard: You’re kidding."
"10","Howard: I don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it."
"10","Leonard: You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time."
"10","Howard: We can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him."
"10","Leonard: You can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best."
"10","Leonard: Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present."
"10","Sheldon: Really?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah. Go ahead, open it."
"10","Sheldon: Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesn’t happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again."
"10","Leonard: Okay. Where were we?"
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Bernadette: For Howie’s occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?"
"10","Amy: Well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?"
"10","Penny: I can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant."
"10","Raj: Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant."
"10","Bernadette: Well, I didn’t. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off."
"10","Raj: Whoa. Just trying to help."
"10","Bernadette: Sorry. Howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on."
"10","Amy: Is there anything we can do?"
"10","Bernadette: Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back."
"10","Raj: No, no. I will take care of it."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, thank you."
"10","Raj: While I’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me."
"10","Penny: All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, I’m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing."
"10","Bernadette: That sounds really nice."
"10","Amy: Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir."
"10","Penny: Okay, that’s the one to beat."
"10","Amy: Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Hey, you’re home early."
"10","Sheldon: You’ll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive."
"10","Amy: Wow. He finally used it. What’d you do?"
"10","Sheldon: No idea. All I know is I’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day."
"10","Amy: Well, I’m really happy for you."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, no. It’s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
"10","Amy: I give up."
"10","Sheldon: You."
"10","Amy: No. I really give up."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives."
"10","Amy: Can I pee now?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. There’s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? You’re missing"
"10","some great stuff out here. Oh, this is good. There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for. But that is the figurative you, not the literal you. I’ll be blowing the whistle. Amy, get up. It’s time to go to work."
"10","Leonard: This train thing worked out better than I thought. He’s home studying the engineer’s manual."
"10","Howard: It’s so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?"
"10","Leonard: Four thousand dollars, worth every penny."
"10","Col Williams: Gentlemen."
"10","Leonard: Colonel Williams. Sir."
"10","Col Williams: Just wanted to see how the guidance system’s coming along."
"10","Howard: Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs."
"10","Leonard: As a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool."
"10","Col Williams: Don’t do that. What’s this?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, nothing. Just some math we don’t need."
"10","Col Williams: This is a different approach. Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?"
"10","Leonard: It’s just a theory. Uh, it’s not even worked out."
"10","Col Williams: Oh. I want this."
"10","Howard: But we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations."
"10","Col Williams: So get the kid with the two shirts to do it."
"10","Leonard: Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works."
"10","Col Williams: Yeah, I want this."
"10","Howard: Okay, but that’s just a theory. It’s not even a complete thought."
"10","Col Williams: You both make excellent points, and thank you for presenting it so articulately. Make this."
"10","Howard: The kid with the two shirts screwed us again."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"10","Penny: All right. You guys ready to get crazy?"
"10","Amy: Well, the bra under here ain’t beige."
"10","Raj: Okay. You ladies have fun tonight."
"10","Stuart: Don’t worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart’s on the job."
"10","Raj: Under the careful supervision of her godfather."
"10","Stuart: My apologies. I didn’t mean to offend you, Don Corleone."
"10","Raj: Like I said, you ladies have fun."
"10","Bernadette: We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let’s party."
"10","Penny: You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we’ll get free drinks."
"10","Bernadette: Call if there’s any problems."
"10","Penny: No. She’s busy. You call Howard."
"10","Raj: Got it."
"10","Bernadette: Call me. Don’t call Howard."
"10","Raj: I would never call Howard."
"10","Stuart: Okay, instead of arguing all night, let’s just split up the baby chores."
"10","Raj: Yeah, great. Um, I’ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Howard: I can’t believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us."
"10","Leonard: Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?"
"10","Howard: I don’t know, but if he yells It’s alive, we run."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn’t hear you. I’m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?"
"10","Howard: How’d you even get that up the stairs?"
"10","Sheldon: I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldn’t, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
"10","Leonard: Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can’t do it without you."
"10","Sheldon: Interesting. Well, so I was right."
"10","Howard: Open a window. It’s about to get smug in here."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don’t think I can go back to theory. I’m an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out."
"10","Sheldon: Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won’t look foolish."
"10","Howard: He’s worried about looking foolish. That’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there."
"10","Leonard: Come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?"
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo."
"10","Scene: Penny’s car."
"10","Amy: Hey, did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?"
"10","Bernadette: Not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open."
"10","Penny: Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun."
"10","Amy: Nothing says fun like being scolded."
"10","Bernadette (phone rings): Oh, it’s Raj. Everything okay?"
"10","(phone rings)"
"10","Raj: Don’t worry. Everything’s fine."
"10","Stuart: Hang up, we don’t need help."
"10","Raj: I don’t need your help deciding when we need help!"
"10","Bernadette: Raj, what’s going on?"
"10","Raj: Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday."
"10","Stuart: It says Tuesday."
"10","Raj: How is that a T?"
"10","Bernadette: I’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer."
"10","Raj: Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch."
"10","Stuart: You’re wasting perfectly good milk."
"10","Raj: Fine, you drink it."
"10","Stuart: It’s just milk."
"10","Bernadette: Stuart, don’t you drink my milk."
"10","Penny: Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?"
"10","Raj: Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge."
"10","Stuart: Hmm. So we just throw this away?"
"10","Raj: What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?"
"10","Stuart: Well, I don’t take it black."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Leonard: Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I’m sure we can figure the rest out."
"10","Howard: All right. Hmm. Feel free to jump in. Hmm is all I got."
"10","Leonard: Oh, we can get this. Is there any chance it’s upside-down?"
"10","Howard: Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us."
"10","Leonard: It’s classified. If we tell anyone, we’d get in trouble."
"10","Howard: Hey, I came up with that and hmm. You haven’t pitched anything."
"10","Leonard: Just keep thinking. I got it."
"10","Howard: You really figured it out?"
"10","Leonard: No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it."
"10","Howard: Oh, you’re a genius."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, I know. That’s not even a math symbol. That’s just Charlie Brown’s hair."
"10","Scene: Penny’s car"
"10","Penny: Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those."
"10","Amy: Renaissance Choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?"
"10","Bernadette (on phone): Hello?"
"10","(on phone)"
"10","Raj: Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep."
"10","Stuart: She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her."
"10","Raj: She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable."
"10","Bernadette: You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?"
"10","Stuart: Wait. She’s settling down."
"10","Raj: Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography."
"10","Penny: Is everything okay?"
"10","Bernadette: Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob."
"10","Amy: Hey, there’s another dance club nearby. I mean, I don’t know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open."
"10","Penny: Maybe we should just call it a night."
"10","Amy: You sure? They’re open till dos."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, we’re all dressed up. Why go home?"
"10","Penny: I’m just not really in the mood anymore."
"10","Bernadette: What’s going on with you?"
"10","Penny: I don’t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth."
"10","Bernadette: I’m not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants."
"10","Amy: I’m not sad. I mean, hello."
"10","Penny: Okay, maybe I’m the one who’s sad."
"10","Amy: What are you sad about?"
"10","Penny: Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby."
"10","Bernadette: You’re upset I had a baby?"
"10","Penny: No, of course not. I just, I didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings."
"10","Amy: What feelings?"
"10","Penny: Pressure. I mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race."
"10","Bernadette: You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I’m constantly worried, I’m always tired, and in a few minutes I’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot."
"10","Penny: I get that, okay? It’s just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating."
"10","Amy: Come on. You’ve got so much to feel good about. You’ve got a great job now."
"10","Penny: Yeah, I guess I am making decent money."
"10","Amy: You make more than I do."
"10","Bernadette: You may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great."
"10","Amy: It’s bigger than mine."
"10","Bernadette: And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice."
"10","Amy: I’m not even engaged once. I don’t even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I’m not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…"
"10","Bernadette: Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry. I can’t help it."
"10","Penny: Oh, that’s gonna make me cry."
"10","Bernadette: And there they go."
"10","Penny: Ew."
"10","Leonard: Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn’t need you after all."
"10","Howard: That’s right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasn’t even that hard."
"10","Leonard: No."
"10","Sheldon: Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I’m okay with it."
"10","Leonard: Aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?"
"10","Sheldon: No, thanks. I’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump."
"10","Howard: It’s a manifold."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Well, I guess it’s fixed."
"10","Leonard: Just look at the board."
"10","Sheldon: That’s wrong."
"10","Leonard: Oh, no, what should we have done differently?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
"10","Howard: Told ya. Can you fix it for us?"
"10","Sheldon: Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads."
"10","Leonard: Come on, Sheldon. You can’t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff."
"10","Howard: But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know."
"10","Leonard: And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system."
"10","Howard: And with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. You’d be the king of the train store."
"10","Sheldon: Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I’m already king of the train store."
"10","Leonard: So, what do you say?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. I’m like the crankshaft of this team."
"10","Howard: That’s a turbo."
"10","Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home."
"10","Scene: The cab of a steam locomotive."
"10","Sheldon: I apologize that it’s so warm in here."
"10","Amy: It is warm in here."
"10","Sheldon: I’ve worked up a bit of a sweat."
"10","Amy: Me, too."
"10","Sheldon: May I borrow your water?"
"10","Sheldon (voice): The light’s green."
"10","(voice)"
"10","Amy (now in her car): Sorry."
"10","(now in her car)"
"10","Sheldon: GPS says we’ll be at the railway in three hours."
"10","Amy: I can get us there in two."

"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Howard: Go. Come on, Raj."
"10","Leonard: You can do this."
"10","Sheldon: There’s no way."
"10","Penny: What is happening?"
"10","Leonard: This is an Euler’s Disk. It’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy."
"10","Penny: Aw, look at you watching sports."
"10","Howard: We’re betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin."
"10","Sheldon: Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time."
"10","Leonard: But Raj is from India, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath."
"10","Penny: Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning."
"10","Amy: Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night."
"10","Sheldon: Kind of busy right now."
"10","Amy: Oh, an Euler’s Disk, fun."
"10","Howard: Yeah, we’re seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it."
"10","Amy: Oh. Immature."
"10","Leonard: How ya doing?"
"10","Sheldon: He’s not gonna make it."
"10","Howard: Yes, he is."
"10","Sheldon: You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage."
"10","Penny: Yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?"
"10","Howard: Ha, you’re interested. You’re out ten bucks."
"10","Sheldon: It’s slowing down."
"10","Leonard: Dig deep, like when we bet you couldn’t fit into Howard’s pants."
"10","Leonard: Yes, he is."
"10","Howard: Come on, Raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just Waiting to Exhale. Yeah, I knew you could do it."
"10","Raj: And j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is Princess Bride."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Raj’s office."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli (on skype): Hello, Rajesh. How are things by you?"
"10","(on skype)"
"10","Raj: Good, good. Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Well, you’re a grown man with a steady job. Why wouldn’t you spend all your father’s money?"
"10","Raj: Oh, Daddy, you’re so rich and funny."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?"
"10","Raj: Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: I’m sorry to hear that."
"10","Raj: I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago."
"10","Raj: You did?"
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: It’s too much work. You’re an adult who can’t get by without an allowance from his parents. Women don’t want that."
"10","Raj: What are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?"
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient. I don’t think I’m the problem."
"10","Raj: I can’t believe what I’m hearing. This is deeply hurtful."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: You’re also too sensitive. Women don’t want that either."
"10","Scene: A restaurant."
"10","Amy: The food here’s supposed to be great. Don’t fill up on chips."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I won’t. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didn’t see that."
"10","Amy: Oh, look. It’s Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi."
"10","Sheldon: Why?"
"10","Amy: Because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place."
"10","Sheldon: I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom."
"10","Sheldon: If the judge couldn’t explain it to me, I don’t see how you will."
"10","Amy: Hi, Bert."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Bert: Oh, hey, guys. What brings you here?"
"10","Amy: Oh, we’re having date night."
"10","Bert: Nice. I’m meeting someone, too."
"10","Amy: Oh, really. Anybody we know?"
"10","Bert: I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony. That’s a Web site for geologists to find love."
"10","Amy: That’s a real thing?"
"10","Bert: Yeah. Their slogan is we’re all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind."
"10","Sheldon: Well, have a lovely evening."
"10","Bert: Thanks. You, too."
"10","Sheldon: If you think that’s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you’re crazy."
"10","Penny: You know, we could’ve come to you guys. You didn’t have to bring the baby here."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, it’s okay. It’s good to get out of the house."
"10","Howard: And the car ride puts her to sleep."
"10","Leonard: Aw, that used to work with Sheldon."
"10","Penny: Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out."
"10","Leonard: Who forgot to crack the window?"
"10","Raj: Hello."
"10","Leonard: Hey."
"10","Penny: Oh, someone’s been shopping at Gucci."
"10","Raj: Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn’t resist."
"10","Bernadette: That’s so sweet of you."
"10","Raj: Yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape."
"10","Howard: Oh, no, now we have two."
"10","Penny: That must’ve been expensive."
"10","Raj: Yeah, it was. But it’s my father’s money and I’m mad at him."
"10","Leonard: What’s going on with your dad?"
"10","Penny: And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel."
"10","Raj: It turns out he doesn’t care if I’m married or if I’m single. He’s basically given up on me."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, I’m sure that’s not true."
"10","Raj: It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry."
"10","Leonard: But all you did was complain when he did that."
"10","Penny: Wait, Leonard, he’s hurting. Let him feel how he feels."
"10","Raj: Thank you, Penny."
"10","Penny: Yeah. Shoes, I’m a seven-and-a-half, boots, I’m an eight."
"10","Scene: The restaurant."
"10","Sheldon: MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?"
"10","Amy: Sorry, I don’t have a list of defunct search engines that I miss."
"10","Bert: Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I’m gonna head out."
"10","Amy: Oh, no. Are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes?"
"10","Bert: Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it’s time to cut bait."
"10","Amy: I’m so sorry."
"10","Sheldon: Bert, I insist that you join us."
"10","Bert: You really wouldn’t mind?"
"10","Sheldon: Not at all. Amy?"
"10","Amy: Fine with me."
"10","Bert: Thanks. I’ll go grab a chair."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, that was so sweet of you."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
"10","Amy: So the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?"
"10","Sheldon: You want me to look at him and listen to him?"
"10","Raj: My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled."
"10","Leonard: I’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?"
"10","Raj: Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled."
"10","Penny: All right, how much exactly does he pay for?"
"10","Raj: Okay, I’ll tell you, but please don’t judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards."
"10","Leonard: I’m trying, but I’m judging."
"10","Howard: Maybe your dad’s right."
"10","Penny: Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself."
"10","Raj: But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, maybe your dad’s right."
"10","Bert: Good question. Let’s see. Infoseek, WebCrawler, oh, HotBot."
"10","Amy: Okay, literally any other topic."
"10","Bert: All right. How did you guys meet?"
"10","Sheldon: Actually, we met online."
"10","Amy: Our-our first date was at a coffee shop."
"10","Sheldon: Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again."
"10","Bert: Well, I really envy your relationship. Other than you two only having sex once a year, you’re the perfect couple."
"10","Amy: You-you know about that?"
"10","Bert: Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does."
"10","Amy: Were you aware of this?"
"10","Sheldon: No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Sheldon: Why aren’t you talking to me?"
"10","Amy: Because I’m mad at you."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Well, now I’m sorry I asked."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, it’s humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life."
"10","Sheldon: What is there to gossip about? We barely have one."
"10","Amy: That’s why they’re doing it."
"10","Sheldon: Is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? If you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works."
"10","Howard: You don’t need your dad’s money. You can get by on your salary."
"10","Leonard: Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and we’ve always been fine."
"10","Raj: Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do."
"10","Penny: All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let’s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?"
"10","Raj: I don’t want to say."
"10","Bernadette: Is it really that high?"
"10","Raj: I don’t want to say because I don’t know how much it is."
"10","Penny: You don’t how much your rent is?"
"10","Raj: My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?"
"10","Penny: Yeah."
"10","Raj: Well, then double it, because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump."
"10","Leonard: Do you know how much your car costs?"
"10","Raj: Not really."
"10","Howard: Well, how much do you spend on food?"
"10","Raj: The housekeeper does the shopping."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, my God, you really are spoiled."
"10","Raj: I’m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: I’m going to bed."
"10","Sheldon: Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together."
"10","Amy: So?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized."
"10","Amy: I’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not."
"10","Sheldon: This isn’t fair. You’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny."
"10","Amy: That’s different. She’s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches."
"10","Sheldon: That lady has a name. I don’t know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom."
"10","Leonard: Sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live."
"10","Bernadette: When you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. How’d you get by?"
"10","Penny: Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of ’em."
"10","Leonard: Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?"
"10","Howard: What, what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don’t you like me?"
"10","Raj: I thought we were best friends?"
"10","Howard: We are, that’s why I’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless."
"10","Bernadette: I’m sorry, Raj. We really just don’t have the space."
"10","Leonard: What if he lives in your garage?"
"10","Bernadette: What if you stop helping?"
"10","Raj: Guys, I’m not living in a garage."
"10","Howard: Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?"
"10","Bernadette: That’s a great idea."
"10","Penny: Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here."
"10","Raj: Thank you, but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father."
"10","Penny: Okay, only if you’re sure. Whew."
"10","Leonard: Yeah."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom."
"10","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?"
"10","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"10","Amy: Yeah?"
"10","Sheldon: Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I’ll take it."
"10","Amy: What is this?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don’t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I’m saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here."
"10","Amy: Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?"
"10","Sheldon: No, I was just excited to list him as a friend."
"10","Amy: Well, I do appreciate you working on this."
"10","Sheldon: I’m sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink."
"10","Amy: What’s that little dot in the middle?"
"10","Sheldon: That’s reserved for thoughts I don’t share with anyone."
"10","Amy: Interesting. You really have secrets you don’t tell me?"
"10","Sheldon: Of course."
"10","Amy: Can I hear one?"
"10","Sheldon: No, they’re private."
"10","Amy: Why? Are they naughty?"
"10","Sheldon: A little."
"10","Amy: Please?"
"10","Sheldon: Fine. Two years ago I got my driver’s license."
"10","Amy: What? Why didn’t you say anything?"
"10","Sheldon: I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important."
"10","Amy: So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn’t have to?"
"10","Sheldon: No, you didn’t. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli (on skype): What?"
"10","Raj: Hello, Father. We need to talk."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: All right."
"10","Raj: I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I’m a man, and I can take care of myself."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: That’s wonderful."
"10","Raj: Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: I am so proud of you."
"10","Raj: Dad, I’m trying to tell you off, and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief."
"10","Dr Koothrapalli: Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money. Where did I fail as a father?"
"10","Raj: Yeah, that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will."
"10","Scene: The cafeteria."
"10","Leonard: Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you."
"10","Raj: Yeah, I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker."
"10","Howard: Oh. How’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?"
"10","Raj: Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem."
"10","Sheldon: Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. We’re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people’s lives."
"10","Bert: He’s right. And I’m sorry for the part I played in this."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you, Bert. You’re a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out."
"10","Bert: That doesn’t paint me in the best light."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – That better?"
"10","Bert: Not really."
"10","Sheldon: All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert."
"10","Leonard: What brought that on?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters."
"10","Howard: That’s understandable."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified."

"10","Following a “previously on” sequence:"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay."
"10","Raj: How bad is it?"
"10","Sheldon: Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?"
"10","Raj: Are you serious?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf."
"10","Penny: Hi."
"10","Leonard: Hey."
"10","Penny: Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms."
"10","Leonard: We’re helping Raj figure out his finances."
"10","Penny: Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping."
"10","Penny: Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look."
"10","Sheldon: He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt."
"10","Howard: I thought your dad paid your cards."
"10","Raj: I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself."
"10","Sheldon: What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?"
"10","Raj: That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad."
"10","Leonard: What is Pink Cheeks?"
"10","Raj: It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that."
"10","Leonard: Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control."
"10","Raj: Like a business manager?"
"10","Sheldon: No, absolutely not. You can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it."
"10","Howard: What if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?"
"10","Sheldon: He sounds like a sociopath."
"10","Leonard: We don’t know, his mother never had him tested."
"10","Sheldon: You’re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion."
"10","Penny: Wait, wait, who’s gonna break it to the penguin?"
"10","Raj: Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize."
"10","Sheldon: Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can’t buy one."
"10","Howard: Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: You’re actually going to Comic-Con?"
"10","Penny: Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I’d tag along."
"10","Amy: Well, that’s sweet. I bet you’ll have fun."
"10","Penny: So, do you want to come?"
"10","Amy: No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to."
"10","Penny: Please? I went to your boring thing last month."
"10","Amy: My aunt’s funeral?"
"10","Penny: Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy."
"10","Amy: Well, I’m not going, but I do think it’s nice you want to."
"10","Penny: It’s not that I want to go, I just think it’ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it."
"10","Amy: Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here."
"10","Scene: The comic book store."
"10","Howard: You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?"
"10","Leonard: No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon’s job."
"10","Sheldon: She’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels."
"10","Howard: And hate all the crowds at the panels."
"10","Sheldon: She’s gonna hate the panels."
"10","Leonard: She’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels."
"10","Howard: Why don’t you just tell her not to come?"
"10","Leonard: Well, she’s so excited, I can’t do that to her."
"10","Howard: What if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?"
"10","Leonard: That I would do to her."
"10","Raj: I can’t believe Penny’s gonna get to go, and I’m not."
"10","Sheldon: You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot."
"10","Stuart: Panels. Just wanted to be included."
"10","Raj; Come on, Sheldon, it’s Comic-Con. Just let me have the money for this, and I won’t ask for anything else."
"10","Sheldon: You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard."
"10","Leonard: See? Miserable."
"10","Raj: Okay, you’re right, I got myself into this, but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys."
"10","Sheldon: Your father may have spoiled you, but I won’t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself."
"10","Howard: Yeah, you’re a grown man who’s highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you."
"10","Raj: Go ahead, make jokes. I don’t know why you think you’re going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby."
"10","Howard: So?"
"10","Raj: Well, so? So you think Bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?"
"10","Leonard: Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can’t afford it, Howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time."
"10","Sheldon: I’m gonna go as Dumbledore."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Howard: Mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?"
"10","Bernadette: Okay."
"10","Howard: What you doing?"
"10","Bernadette: Making lasagna."
"10","Howard: Oh, she’s sexy, she can cook. I’m such a lucky guy."
"10","Bernadette: You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?"
"10","Howard: No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, dear God, you’re cheating on me with Raj."
"10","Howard: Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but it’s not a big deal."
"10","Bernadette: What is it?"
"10","Howard: Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I’m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go."
"10","Bernadette: It’s so hard to say no to you."
"10","Howard: Thank you."
"10","Bernadette: So I’ll say maybe."
"10","Howard: What? Why?"
"10","Bernadette: You said tickets don’t go on sale till Friday, right?"
"10","Howard: Yeah."
"10","Bernadette: You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?"
"10","Bernadette: See where I’m going with this?"
"10","Bernadette: If you don’t know how to make lasagna, Google does."
"10","Leonard: Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are."
"10","Penny: Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there."
"10","Leonard: I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where’s Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel."
"10","Penny: Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here’s the hotel room we all share."
"10","Penny: Well, you and I would get our own room, right?"
"10","Leonard: Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon’s feet and my head? That’s where you go."
"10","Penny: Well, it’s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm."
"10","Leonard: Don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it’s off the chain mail."
"10","Leonard: I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go."
"10","Sheldon: That’s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume."
"10","Stuart: Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box."
"10","Raj: But you charged me hundreds for this stuff."
"10","Stuart: I know. And I did it with a straight face."
"10","Raj: But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con."
"10","Stuart: Well, all right. I’ll give you 25 bucks. That’s my best offer."
"10","Raj: I have no choice."
"10","Stuart: You know, if you want to make extra money, I could throw some work your way."
"10","Raj: Really? I’ll do anything."
"10","Stuart: Great, you’re hired. First thing you can do is put price tags on these. Start the little ones at fifty."
"10","Scene: Penny’s car."
"10","Penny: You know, it’s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days."
"10","Amy: Comic-Con’s five days."
"10","Penny: Are you kidding me?"
"10","Amy: Why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go?"
"10","Penny: I can’t, it’ll break his heart. You know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside."
"10","Amy: He is an indoor cat."
"10","Penny: You know, maybe it won’t be that bad. Leonard says it’s really mainstream now. Comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell."
"10","Bernadette (off): Howie, can you get that?"
"10","(off)"
"10","Howard (off): Kind of busy."
"10","Bernadette (off): Busy like I’ll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?"
"10","Howard: Hey."
"10","Raj: What’s with the gloves?"
"10","Howard: They complete my ensemble. What do you want?"
"10","Raj: I’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do."
"10","Howard: Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?"
"10","Bernadette: No."
"10","Howard: I tried."
"10","Leonard: Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique."
"10","Penny: Is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah, if you want us to look like losers."
"10","Penny: Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah, of course, why?"
"10","Penny: This is just something you usually do together, and if I’m screwing it up, I don’t have to go."
"10","Leonard: Oh, why? Do you not want to go?"
"10","Penny: Why? Do you not want me to go?"
"10","Leonard: No, I want you to go."
"10","Penny: Okay, good, ’cause that’s what I want, too."
"10","Leonard: Now we’re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don’t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con."
"10","Sheldon: If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don’t want that either."
"10","Leonard: Is that nice?"
"10","Sheldon: No, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship."
"10","Leonard: Uh, it’s more complicated than that."
"10","Sheldon: I’m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole."
"10","Leonard: Do you think she’s as honest with you?"
"10","Sheldon: I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I’d like to think she meant it."
"10","Howard: There’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck."
"10","Raj: Yeah, you’d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm."
"10","Bernadette: I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming."
"10","Raj: Here, let me help you."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you."
"10","Raj: Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you."
"10","Bernadette: There she goes."
"10","Raj: Stay, I’ll get her."
"10","Bernadette: I appreciate it."
"10","Raj: That’s fine. She and I can cry together."
"10","Bernadette: He’s such a sweetie."
"10","Howard: I know, I wish there was some way we could help him."
"10","Bernadette: If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over."
"10","Howard: Yeah, that’s working out great for me."
"10","Amy: Penny says they’re ready to go."
"10","Sheldon: Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, women can wear make up, it’s not lying."
"10","Sheldon: I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?"
"10","Amy: Wait, wait, wait, what’s Leonard lying about?"
"10","Sheldon: He doesn’t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He’s just doing it to make her happy."
"10","Amy: Really? Because she doesn’t actually want to go. She’s just doing it to make him happy."
"10","Sheldon: So they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to tell them."
"10","Amy: No, you’re not gonna tell them anything. You’re gonna stay out of it."
"10","Sheldon: Why?"
"10","Amy: Because it’s between them."
"10","Sheldon: Well, if you haven’t noticed, I’ve been between them for the last ten years."
"10","Penny: Hey."
"10","Amy: Hi."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Penny: Hey, babe, you want to drive?"
"10","Leonard: Sure, or you can."
"10","Penny: No, it’s fine, I know you don’t like the way I drive."
"10","Leonard: I don’t have a problem with your driving."
"10","Sheldon: Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything."
"10","Amy: Shh."
"10","Penny: Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me."
"10","Leonard: He wasn’t in a car, but okay."
"10","Penny: Just say you want to drive."
"10","Leonard: I honestly don’t."
"10","Penny: Amy, do us a favour, please drive."
"10","Amy: Sure, happy to."
"10","Leonard: If you want to drive, just drive. I don’t see why this has to be so complicated."
"10","Penny: It’s not complicated. Amy’s driving, that’s it."
"10","Leonard: That’s not it because you’re clearly upset."
"10","Penny: You’re the one who seems upset."
"10","Leonard: Why would I be upset?"
"10","Amy: Because you don’t want her to go to Comic-Con."
"10","Sheldon: This is an interesting way to stay out of it."
"10","Penny: Wait, you don’t want me to go?"
"10","Leonard: Well, I just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. You set ’em up, I knock ’em down, good job."
"10","Leonard: Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?"
"10","Penny: I just thought it would make you happy."
"10","Leonard: O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and I don’t need to bring you, is everything good?"
"10","Penny: Hold on, I’m trying to decide if I’m mad at you. No, I’m happy I don’t have to go."
"10","Leonard: All right, problem solved."
"10","Penny: Okay."
"10","Sheldon: Not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…"
"10","Amy: Oh, my God, stop talking."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"10","Amy: The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?"
"10","Bernadette: Kinda."
"10","Howard: Dinner’s almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat."
"10","Penny: Hey, if you’re still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket."
"10","Raj: Thank you, but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year."
"10","Sheldon: Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either."
"10","Bernadette: Howie?"
"10","Howard: Sure. This is for you."
"10","Raj: What’s this?"
"10","Bernadette: It’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you’ve done."
"10","Howard: There’s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con."
"10","Stuart: Um, I also take care of Halley."
"10","Bernadette: And you live here for free."
"10","Stuart: I do, ma’am, thank you, ma’am."
"10","Raj: This is so generous of you, I, um, I don’t know what to say."
"10","Leonard: Now you can come with us."
"10","Penny: Yeah, there’s room in the bed by Sheldon’s feet."
"10","Raj: As much as I appreciate this, I can’t accept it, okay? Halley’s my goddaughter, I don’t take care of her for money."
"10","Stuart: I would."
"10","Bernadette: Keep it. Consider it a gift."
"10","Sheldon: Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?"
"10","Bernadette: What’s the difference?"
"10","Sheldon: When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight."
"10","Raj: It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that."
"10","Amy: So you’re not going to Comic-Con?"
"10","Raj: I’ve been plenty of times. If I miss one, it’s fine. I’m a big boy."
"10","Sheldon: I’m a big boy, and if I missed one, I’d throw a big-boy tantrum."
"10","Leonard: You know what? I’ve gone 12 times. Maybe I’ll sit out this year, too."
"10","Penny: Really?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend."
"10","Penny: Ooh, how about white-water rafting?"
"10","Leonard: Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?"
"10","Howard: You know what, I’m not gonna go either. I’m a father now. I’d rather spend time with my family."
"10","Bernadette: You just don’t want to go alone with Sheldon."
"10","Howard: I’m gonna go check on dinner."
"10","Amy: Sounds like everyone’s staying home. What do you say?"
"10","Sheldon: Nuts to that, I’m going to Comic-Con."
"10","Amy: By yourself?"
"10","Sheldon: Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends."
"10","Stuart: I’ll go with you."
"10","Sheldon: That’s very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July."
"10","Sheldon: There’s my pretty girlfriend."
"10","Amy: I’m not going with you to Comic-Con."
"10","Sheldon: What? Can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?"
"10","Amy: He can, but it’s still not changing my mind."
"10","Sheldon: Well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. It’s a list of this year’s panelists. It’s long, isn’t it?"
"10","Series 10 Episode 18 – The Escape Hatch Identification"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Leonard: Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?"
"10","Penny: What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?"
"10","Leonard: No. He can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"10","Bernadette: What’s so funny?"
"10","Howard: Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote India."
"10","Bernadette: Don’t post that, be supportive."
"10","Howard: Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?"
"10","Bernadette: We’re smart. I’m sure we can think of something."
"10","Howard: You want to let him live here?"
"10","Bernadette: Oh, we’re smarter than that."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom."
"10","Sheldon: I know our apartment’s small, but I think we can make room."
"10","Amy: No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue."
"10","Leonard: We do have Sheldon’s old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him."
"10","Penny: You’re a good friend."
"10","Leonard: Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?"
"10","Penny: You’re an even better husband."
"10","Howard: I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me."
"10","Bernadette: Where would he stay? We already have Stuart."
"10","Howard: Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate."
"10","Bernadette: That sounds awful."
"10","Howard: Let’s hope he thinks so, too."
"10","Amy: For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues."
"10","Sheldon: Wow. I’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"10","Raj (answering phone): Hello."
"10","(answering phone)"
"10","Howard: Hey, uh, so we’ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you."
"10","Raj: That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in."
"10","Howard: I know it’s not ideal, but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down."
"10","Raj: I cannot thank you enough."
"10","Howard: It is our pleasure. (beep, beep, beep) Hey, can you hold on one sec? Hello?"
"10","(beep, beep, beep)"
"10","Leonard: Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?"
"10","Raj: Uh, yeah. Why do you ask?"
"10","Leonard: You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours."
"10","Raj: Oh, my God, that’s so generous."
"10","Leonard: It’s the least we can do."
"10","Raj: I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?"
"10","Howard: Well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems."
"10","Raj: But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?"
"10","Howard: Yeah. We barely use it, so it’ll be like it’s yours."
"10","Raj: Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second."
"10","Howard: What?"
"10","Raj: Hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?"
"10","Leonard: I don’t have a loofah."
"10","Raj: Okay, well, if I move in, you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?"
"10","Howard: I don’t know. Why are you asking all these questions?"
"10","Raj: Well, to be honest, Leonard’s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom."
"10","Howard: Great. Go live there."
"10","Raj: But you made the garage sound so fun."
"10","Howard: I just didn’t want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there."
"10","Raj: One second. Okay, I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?"
"10","Penny: Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?"
"10","Raj: Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please."
"10","Scene: The lobby."
"10","Leonard: Hey."
"10","Amy: Hi."
"10","Sheldon: Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine."
"10","Penny: What’s it for?"
"10","Sheldon: Roofing."
"10","Penny: Yeah, it’s yours."
"10","Sheldon: Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, I’m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, for a little while."
"10","Sheldon: What about his dog?"
"10","Penny: She’ll be in her crate, it’s not a big deal."
"10","Sheldon: I suppose that’s acceptable."
"10","Amy: Well, Sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland."
"10","Sheldon: If real dogs gave me buttons, I’d like them, too. Well, I think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend."
"10","Leonard: And I think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication Amy’s clearly giving you."
"10","Sheldon: And what is that supposed to mean?"
"10","Penny: Well, it’s like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction."
"10","Leonard: Just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter."
"10","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"10","Sheldon: If you’re implying that I’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it."
"10","Leonard: Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it."
"10","Amy: Don’t listen to them. What’s weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right."
"10","Sheldon: I mean, it’s unfair; people just assume I’m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room."
"10","Amy: But you are, aren’t you?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I’m outraged."
"10","Amy: Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on."
"10","Sheldon: Well, that’s been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren’t me."
"10","Amy: There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room."
"10","Sheldon: Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway."
"10","Amy: And there is the love of which I speak."
"10","Sheldon: I realize it’s irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I’m feeling a bit replaced."
"10","Amy: Well, this isn’t an easy time for him. He’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated."
"10","Sheldon: Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?"
"10","Raj: Can I get anyone anything at all?"
"10","Penny: Raj, you don’t have to serve us."
"10","Raj: It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up."
"10","Howard: It was really no problem."
"10","Bernadette: Not for you, box of towels."
"10","Raj: Anyway, thanks again."
"10","Howard: Hey, look at that. You’ve got a Raj, we’ve got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together."
"10","Leonard: I don’t know. Yours looks like he has worms."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: You ready to go?"
"10","Sheldon: All set."
"10","Amy: What’s that?"
"10","Sheldon: A housewarming gift for Raj."
"10","Amy: Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present."
"10","Sheldon: It’s nothing like that. I just, I thought about Raj’s situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello."
"10","Penny: Hi."
"10","Leonard: Perfect timing. Food’s ready."
"10","Sheldon: Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj."
"10","Penny: Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that."
"10","Amy: No. I already asked."
"10","Raj: Thank you, Sheldon. It’s a blank notebook."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I’m sure you will, too."
"10","Howard: He also never had sex in that room. That’s something else to look forward to."
"10","Raj: This means a lot."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. You’re losing your apartment, you’re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated."
"10","Amy: Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy’s words."
"10","Sheldon: I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez."
"10","Raj: You’re right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You’re such a jerk."
"10","Sheldon: Can you believe this guy?"
"10","Everyone: Yes."
"10","Sheldon: I thought that was gonna break the other way."
"10","Amy: Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place."
"10","Sheldon: Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you’re happy."
"10","Raj: What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck."
"10","Sheldon: How come he can say it and I can’t?"
"10","Amy: Just keep walking."
"10","Beverley (on skype): Hello, Sheldon. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?"
"10","(on skype)"
"10","Sheldon: Honestly, I’ve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you’re very busy these days."
"10","Beverley: Oh, I just say that because he prattles. What’s going on?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."
"10","Beverley: Mm. Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?"
"10","Sheldon: Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"
"10","Beverley: Very well, but, uh, if you don’t mind, I’d still like to pause for effect. Now, you’ve recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?"
"10","Sheldon: I have."
"10","Beverley: Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you’re forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever."
"10","Sheldon: I hadn’t thought about that."
"10","Amy: And don’t start thinking about it now."
"10","Beverley: Hello, Amy. Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with Sheldon."
"10","Amy: That’s not true."
"10","Beverley: She said defensively."
"10","Amy: This isn’t about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny."
"10","Beverley: Interesting. They’ve found a need to take yet another room mate. Seems they’re avoiding some harsh realities themselves."
"10","Sheldon: I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, you’re good."
"10","Beverley: That is the word on the street, dear."
"10","Raj: Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day, I’m already causing problems."
"10","Penny: You didn’t do anything. It’s Sheldon."
"10","Leonard: You didn’t do anything, it’s Sheldon. That’d make a nice needlepoint pillow."
"10","Penny: So, relax. We’re happy to have you."
"10","Raj: Thank you, but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?"
"10","Penny: Do you actually pay for that haircut?"
"10","Raj: That’ll do it."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?"
"10","Raj: Sheldon, she’s fine."
"10","Sheldon: Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she’s stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you."
"10","Raj: Thank you. I appreciate that."
"10","Sheldon: No, I can’t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better."
"10","Leonard: I don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother."
"10","Sheldon: Beverly pointed out that I’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship."
"10","Penny: What are you talking about? We’re fine."
"10","Sheldon: Yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it’s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, I’m sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to McDonald’s."
"10","Beverley (on skype): Hello, Leonard."
"10","Leonard: Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don’t have marital problems."
"10","Beverley: I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss."
"10","Leonard: Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone."
"10","Penny: Yeah, this is a special circumstance."
"10","Beverley: Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well."
"10","Penny: Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special."
"10","Beverley: Do you agree with that?"
"10","Leonard: Well, now that you point it out…"
"10","Penny: Are you kidding me?"
"10","Leonard: We do seem to keep finding room mates."
"10","Penny: Now you’re taking her side?"
"10","Beverley: Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard. That’s for your parade of room mates to do."
"10","Raj: Howard? Howard? It’s me, it’s just me."
"10","Howard: What are you doing here?"
"10","Raj: Well, I texted you, but you didn’t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing."
"10","Stuart: Not on my watch."
"10","Bernadette: It’s fine. It’s just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine."
"10","Stuart: And if my heart stops, just let me go."
"10","Raj: I’m sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems."
"10","Howard: I’ll say it again. India."
"10","Raj: Can I just stay in the garage?"
"10","Bernadette: Don’t do that. We’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning."
"10","Raj: Thank you."
"10","Stuart: Come on, I’ll get you some sheets. Then I’ll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine."
"10","Howard: Never should’ve had all these kids so close together."
"10","Amy: You okay?"
"10","Sheldon: I can’t sleep."
"10","Amy: What’s wrong?"
"10","Sheldon: Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch."
"10","Amy: Is that bothering you?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes. I don’t care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything."
"10","Amy: I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain."
"10","Sheldon: What if she’s correct? Doesn’t that say something troubling about us?"
"10","Amy: I don’t know. I just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan."
"10","Sheldon: That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?"
"10","Amy: You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. It’s not a good influence."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s living room."
"10","Stuart: If you’re looking for spare change, I already cleaned it out."
"10","Raj: Well, didn’t think this is where my life would be."
"10","Stuart: Me, either. I’m in a bedroom and you’re on a couch. I’m actually winning."
"10","Raj: You know, we’re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together."
"10","Stuart: Okay, listen to me. There is no reason to leave here. This is great. Everyone’s nice. It’s comfortable. If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home."
"10","Raj: Wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?"
"10","Stuart: Better than I feel in their steam shower? I don’t think so."
"10","Sheldon: Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard’s basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you’re dessert."
"10","Amy: I want to say aw, but I’m gonna say ew."
"10","Raj: No, you see, I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person."
"10","Stuart: Good for you. This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it."
"10","Raj: Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?"
"10","Stuart: Hey, look, I went to art college, I tried to make it as a graphic artist, a comic book artist, and you know what I got for my efforts? A visible rib cage. I’m not kidding. You could see my heart beating."
"10","Raj: Well, no offence, but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics."
"10","Stuart: Oh, great, it’ll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head."
"10","Penny: Morning."
"10","Leonard: Did you know Raj moved out last night?"
"10","Penny: What? Why?"
"10","Leonard: Leonard and Penny, I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused. I went to stay at Howard’s. PS Cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building."
"10","Penny: I feel terrible."
"10","Leonard: Should we go bring him back?"
"10","Penny: Well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems."
"10","Leonard: Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. It’s like being possessed, but instead of Satan it’s, actually, it’s the same thing."
"10","Penny: All right, so we’ll ask him to come back."
"10","Leonard: Well, great."
"10","Penny: Don’t you want to get dressed first?"
"10","Leonard: Just one second. Help, Cinnamon’s loose in the building."
"10","Sheldon (off): Amy, quick, lock the door."
"10","(off)"
"10","Penny: We’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really weren’t fighting about you."
"10","Raj: I just never want to be a burden on my friends."
"10","Stuart: Me, either. Don’t want to be a burden. Hey, is that the baby? I’ll go check."
"10","Leonard: You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us."
"10","Raj: But I also upset Sheldon, and he’s not gonna want to come over if I’m there."
"10","Penny: More reasons for you to stay."
"10","Stuart: Halley’s fine."
"10","Bernadette: You know she’s at my parents’ house, right?"
"10","Stuart: And she’s having the time of her life."
"10","Howard: If you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here."
"10","Bernadette: Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass."
"10","Raj: I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone."
"10","Penny: Then it’s settled."
"10","Raj: And just so you know, it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable."
"10","Bernadette: Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever."
"10","Stuart: Hey, that’s no way to talk about your baby."
"10","Sheldon: You know what? I’m proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party."
"10","Amy: Yup, we’re killin’ it."
"10","Series 10 Episode 19 – The Collaboration Fluctuation"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Raj: You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana."
"10","Penny: Oh, that’s beautiful. What does it mean?"
"10","Raj: Downward-facing dog."
"10","Penny: Yeah, I guess they don’t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down."
"10","Raj: Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there’s a word for it."
"10","Leonard: I thought we were getting breakfast before work."
"10","Penny: Oh, right, sorry."
"10","Raj: It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me."
"10","Penny: If you want, I can get ready in five minutes."
"10","Leonard: It’s cute that you think that. Don’t worry about it."
"10","Raj: Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?"
"10","Leonard: Sure. You’re living here for free, I guess I owe you."
"10","Raj: Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl."
"10","Penny: Yeah, bye, sweetie."
"10","Leonard: Bye."
"10","Penny: Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard."
"10","Raj: Okay, and tree pose."
"10","Leonard: Well, she’s done."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Amy’s car."
"10","Sheldon: Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope."
"10","Amy: That’s great. How so?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, the project is classified. I can’t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the (honks horn) I used the (honks horn) And then I (honks horn) And that did it. (Car passes honking horn) Wow, I wonder what they’re redacting."
"10","(honks horn)"
"10","(Car passes honking horn)"
"10","Amy: Why don’t you ask me what I’m working on?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts."
"10","Amy: I’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it."
"10","Sheldon: So you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain."
"10","Amy: Yes, I’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place."
"10","Sheldon: Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle."
"10","Amy: You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something."
"10","Scene: The cafeteria."
"10","Sheldon: Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."
"10","Howard: Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?"
"10","Raj: The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food."
"10","Leonard: He does raise an interesting point."
"10","Sheldon: Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I’ll wait."
"10","Leonard: I understand it, Sheldon."
"10","Raj: Yeah, me, too."
"10","Howard: I’m sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?"
"10","Raj: It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work."
"10","Sheldon: Well, don’t get me wrong. Neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we’re going for a drive."
"10","Raj: So did you confront Jennifer?"
"10","Penny: No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick."
"10","Raj: Paul."
"10","Penny: Paul."
"10","Leonard: Who’s Paul?"
"10","Penny: Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He’s married to Nancy."
"10","Leonard: Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?"
"10","Penny: I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does."
"10","Raj: Don’t worry, Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour."
"10","Leonard: Jerry?"
"10","Raj: It didn’t work for Randy, it didn’t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer."
"10","Penny: Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games."
"10","Leonard: Tina?"
"10","Raj: With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about."
"10","Penny: Mm."
"10","Leonard: I went to your office Christmas party?"
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: You know, I like harp lessons, but I’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?"
"10","Sheldon: I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation."
"10","Amy: Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?"
"10","Sheldon: It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, this is really interesting."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, and this one won’t stain my teeth purple."
"10","Amy: You know, we’ve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?"
"10","Sheldon: That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules."
"10","Amy: Well, that would make me feel better."
"10","Sheldon: All right, let’s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way."
"10","Amy: That’s a ridiculous rule."
"10","Sheldon: Is it?"
"10","Penny: Okay, how is that?"
"10","Raj: I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin."
"10","Penny: Well, this is a moisturizing mask."
"10","Raj: Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin."
"10","Penny: Hey, I hope you don’t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night."
"10","Raj: I thought someone looked brighter and tighter."
"10","Leonard: I’d still like to know who Jerry is."
"10","Penny: Don’t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?"
"10","Leonard: That would be great. Thank you."
"10","Raj: You want to go shopping?"
"10","Penny: Ooh, yes. Fun."
"10","Leonard: Or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game."
"10","Montage of shopping scenes."
"10","Sheldon: I believe I’ve made some progress on our ground rules."
"10","Amy: Oh, good. What are they?"
"10","Sheldon: Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,"
"10","my name goes first. Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first. I don’t want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off."
"10","Amy: Can I see that?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, of course. I’ll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, if we’re gonna have ground rules, I’ll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules."
"10","Sheldon: I’d write that down, but I can’t now, can I?"
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s minivan."
"10","Leonard: I mean, they didn’t say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel."
"10","Howard: Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting."
"10","Leonard: Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too."
"10","Bernadette: Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts."
"10","Leonard: Oh, it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn’t that right, Halley?"
"10","Halley: (cries)"
"10","(cries)"
"10","Howard: Well, at least someone had the courage to say it."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s door."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thing’s gonna happen."
"10","Amy: Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?"
"10","Sheldon: Fire away."
"10","Amy: Number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition."
"10","Sheldon: That’s smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0."
"10","Amy: Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There’s no need to call an idea stupid."
"10","Sheldon: Aw, someone drew a penis in it."
"10","Amy: Are you listening?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m sorry, go ahead."
"10","Amy: Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat."
"10","Sheldon: Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we’re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me."
"10","Amy: Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?"
"10","Sheldon: Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be."
"10","Montage of Sheldon and Amy working together."
"10","Amy: Wow. Look at that."
"10","Sheldon: Yes, this is remarkable."
"10","Amy: So we’re agreed, it’s complete garbage."
"10","Sheldon: By the way, your name can go first."
"10","Scene: Inside a store."
"10","Leonard: I mean, I’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable."
"10","Bernadette: Well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?"
"10","Leonard: A little, until I saw them in matching tops."
"10","Howard: Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday."
"10","Bernadette: Well, have you talked to them about it?"
"10","Leonard: Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?"
"10","Howard: This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you."
"10","Bernadette: Look, Raj just gets along with women."
"10","Leonard: I know, but he was my friend first. It’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together."
"10","Howard: You sure you don’t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me."
"10","Amy: I don’t know where we went wrong."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, the math is so inelegant. I’m not even sure it makes sense."
"10","Amy: Well, don’t give up. Maybe we can fix it."
"10","Sheldon: Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling."
"10","Amy: I can hear your face talking, so we’re even."
"10","Sheldon: All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races."
"10","Amy: Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I’ll blow it. Better?"
"10","Sheldon: No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that’s me. Never mind, it’s fine."
"10","Amy: You know, you’re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea."
"10","Sheldon: Hold on. I see what’s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex."
"10","Amy: That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape."
"10","Raj: Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?"
"10","Penny: I probably should have spit out my gum first."
"10","Raj: Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."
"10","Penny: Mm. Well, we’ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?"
"10","Raj: When did he leave?"
"10","Penny: Yeah, that’s rude."
"10","Leonard: You know, it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera."
"10","Bernadette: Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah."
"10","Howard: You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don’t want to."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard."
"10","Howard: Wait. What? What do I make you do?"
"10","Bernadette: Let’s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector’s meet and greet."
"10","Howard: It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. It’s not my fault you didn’t listen."
"10","Leonard: I’m sure I’m overreacting."
"10","Bernadette: You’re entitled to feel how you feel. If you don’t like it, you should just talk to her."
"10","Leonard: I don’t want to sound like a jealous baby."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her."
"10","Amy: I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive."
"10","Sheldon: Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I’m sensitive."
"10","Amy: Hey, I wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex."
"10","Sheldon: That is a daring and insightful solution."
"10","Amy: We’re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting."
"10","Sheldon: What if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?"
"10","Amy: I suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes."
"10","Sheldon: Well, if that’s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
"10","Amy: How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero."
"10","Sheldon: It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship."
"10","Amy: There’s only one clear choice."
"10","Sheldon: Science it is."
"10","Amy: No, you bonehead."
"10","Sheldon: Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I’m not the sharpest dresser."
"10","Leonard: Anyway, I know it’s silly, but since Raj moved in, I’ve been feeling a little left out."
"10","Penny: Well, sweetie, that’s crazy."
"10","Raj: No, no, Penny, don’t dismiss his feelings."
"10","Leonard: Thank you. I just feel…"
"10","Raj: Hang on, I’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. I just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place."
"10","Leonard: Well, to be truthful…"
"10","Penny: Well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? I mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends."
"10","Raj: I don’t want to speak for Leonard."
"10","Leonard: Thank you. I…"
"10","Raj: But when you’re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe."
"10","Penny: Yeah, you’re right. You know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff."
"10","Raj: I’m a good listener."
"10","Penny: Yeah."
"10","Leonard: Hey, Olsen twins…"
"10","Penny: What?"
"10","Leonard: Well, I mean, I’m sitting right here. You’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation."
"10","Raj: I’m sorry. What did you want to say?"
"10","Leonard: I don’t know, you pretty much covered it."
"10","Sheldon: Can you read them back?"
"10","Amy: Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition."
"10","Sheldon: Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you’re going down, punk."
"10","Amy: Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."
"10","Sheldon: I love that one."
"10","Amy: Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors."
"10","Series 10 Episode 20 – The Recollection Dissipation"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Penny: Hey, Leonard, if you’re not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work."
"10","Leonard: Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project."
"10","Penny: Oh, are you sure? We’re celebrating our new ADD drug, and it’ll probably be over in, like, six minutes."
"10","Amy: Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah, why?"
"10","Amy: Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project."
"10","Leonard: We’ve had this planned for a week."
"10","Amy: Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning."
"10","Raj: Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon."
"10","Penny: Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?"
"10","Raj: Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don’t answer. I’d love to."
"10","Sheldon: Hello."
"10","Amy: Why did you tell Leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?"
"10","Sheldon: Because I am."
"10","Amy: But you said you were working with me."
"10","Penny: Uh-oh. Someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom."
"10","Sheldon: I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom."
"10","Leonard: I’m sorry, what is this plan you have?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."
"10","Leonard: When does that start?"
"10","Sheldon: Soon. See, I could’ve said in the near future, but I didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
"10","Raj: Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldon’s a genius? But I didn’t."
"10","Scene: The guys laboratory."
"10","Sheldon: Gentlemen, I’ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?"
"10","Howard: Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?"
"10","Sheldon: These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry, I have lentil soup."
"10","Leonard: It’s getting harder to pretend."
"10","Howard: Anyway, Sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter."
"10","Sheldon: Run down the pros and cons of each for me."
"10","Howard: Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
"10","Howard: You can just feel the time being saved."
"10","Scene: Amy’s laboratory"
"10","Sheldon: Ah, I’m back, you got me for eight minutes."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, this is silly. You can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this."
"10","Sheldon: The coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?"
"10","Scene: The guys laboratory"
"10","Howard: The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second."
"10","Leonard: It can’t be four revolutions, it’s got to be seven."
"10","Howard: Seven? Look at the board, it’s four."
"10","Leonard: Oh, my God, it’s seven."
"10","Howard: Four."
"10","–"
"10","Leonard: Seven."
"10","Sheldon: It’s five and a half."
"10","Howard: Son of a bitch, it’s five and a half."
"10","Sheldon: BRB. That’s short for be right back. I’m saving so much time."
"10","Scene: Amy’s laboratory."
"10","Sheldon: The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup."
"10","Amy: Incredible. Sheldon, I didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong."
"10","Sheldon: You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler, works."
"10","Leonard: I got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Stuart: Hey."
"10","Bernadette: Hey."
"10","Stuart: Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night."
"10","Bernadette: No problem."
"10","Stuart: Was just doing my taxes."
"10","Bernadette: Okay."
"10","Stuart: Actually, if I could, if I could just check one more…"
"10","Bernadette: Already cleared the browser history."
"10","Stuart: You’re a good woman. What you working on?"
"10","Bernadette: Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back."
"10","Stuart: Oh, that’s right, maternity leave’s almost over. Ah, you excited?"
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, I mean, I’ll miss Halley, but it’ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch."
"10","Stuart: That’s great, good for you."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she’s gonna be fine."
"10","Stuart: Ah, of course she is."
"10","Bernadette: And that day care is great."
"10","Stuart: It is. I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows."
"10","Bernadette: Plus, I, I think I’m setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won’t know where I went or if I’m ever coming back. That’ll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special."
"10","Stuart: Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don’t know what to do right now."
"10","Bernadette: It’s okay, I’m just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?"
"10","Stuart: Well, don’t you think it’d be healthier if you told him what’s going on with you?"
"10","Bernadette: Don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?"
"10","Stuart: Your secret is safe with me."
"10","Scene: The laundry room."
"10","Penny: Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack."
"10","Penny: You know, there was a time I would say what’s a soup sack? But I’m glad we’re past that. (Sheldon sneezes) You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didn’t mean Thor? And then you would say Touché, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say"
"10","(Sheldon sneezes)"
"10","God bless you."
"10","Sheldon: Well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?"
"10","Penny: Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day."
"10","Sheldon: Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasn’t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."
"10","Penny: Are you getting sick?"
"10","Sheldon: Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick."
"10","Penny: Well, you’re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard."
"10","Sheldon: I’m fine."
"10","Penny: All right. Well, we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching Frozen."
"10","Sheldon: That didn’t happen."
"10","Penny: You also got a nosebleed watching Up."
"10","Sheldon: Just do your laundry."
"10","Bernadette: Stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner."
"10","Stuart: Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning. And to be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of your meatloaf."
"10","Howard: Hey, what’s for dinner?"
"10","Bernadette: Meatloaf."
"10","Howard: Oh, cool."
"10","Bernadette: Stuart made it."
"10","Howard: Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work."
"10","Bernadette: Sounds great."
"10","Howard: Speaking of which, for day care, it’ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it."
"10","Bernadette: Hmm, guess it should be me."
"10","Stuart: I can’t do it. They have a picture of me on file now."
"10","Howard: You okay?"
"10","Bernadette: Of course, why?"
"10","Howard: Well, I don’t know, you seem a little upset."
"10","Bernadette: No, I’m fine."
"10","Howard: You sure?"
"10","Stuart: Why don’t you think she’s fine? She sounds fine, she looks fine. If I saw her on the street I’d say, damn, that girl’s fine."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, you’re sick, go back to bed."
"10","Sheldon: I am fine. Here, eat your toast. (Sneezes) Sorry."
"10","(Sneezes)"
"10","Amy: It’s okay, now I don’t need butter."
"10","Sheldon: Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. It’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix."
"10","Amy: You need sleep."
"10","Sheldon: What I need is to get to work."
"10","Amy: Well, I don’t want your germs around me."
"10","Sheldon: What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?"
"10","Amy: Sheldon, are you okay?"
"10","Sheldon: What’s going on? How’d I get here?"
"10","Leonard: I don’t know, we came home from work and we found you."
"10","Sheldon: Home from work? What time is it?"
"10","Penny: It’s nine o’clock."
"10","Sheldon: Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?"
"10","Raj: Wait, you don’t remember?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine."
"10","Leonard: You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab."
"10","Sheldon: At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?"
"10","Raj: I don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."
"10","Sheldon: My pants are missing, I don’t remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?"
"10","Penny: I don’t know, check your body for tattoos?"
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, would you be a lamb?"
"10","Leonard: She’s kidding."
"10","Sheldon: Wait, wait. Where’s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag."
"10","Raj: It’s right here."
"10","Sheldon: Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh, no."
"10","Penny: Okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?"
"10","Sheldon: What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project."
"10","Leonard: How could you lose that?"
"10","Amy: It’s okay, I’m sure we’ll find it."
"10","Penny: Look, it’s got to be around here somewhere."
"10","Amy: Maybe it’s wherever your pants are."
"10","Raj: Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook."
"10","Howard: Hey."
"10","Stuart: Ah, hello."
"10","Howard: Look, something’s going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?"
"10","Stuart: Well, nope, not a word."
"10","Howard: Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?"
"10","Stuart: No, but I did mention it to my therapist."
"10","Howard: Well, I know she’s mad at me about something."
"10","Stuart: Well, what have you done that would upset her?"
"10","Howard: Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?"
"10","Stuart: Well, why don’t you just start with the worst thing?"
"10","Howard: Hmm, let’s see. Mm. Okay, here we go, six years ago, I got a call that Bernie’s great-aunt, Trixie, died."
"10","Stuart: And?"
"10","Howard: And I forgot to give her the message."
"10","Stuart: That’s terrible."
"10","Howard: The terrible part is, ever since then, I’ve been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie."
"10","Stuart: Oh Howard."
"10","Howard: Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie’s purse."
"10","Penny: The notebook isn’t in the bathroom."
"10","Amy: I can’t find it, either. How can he not remember a day?"
"10","Penny: Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too."
"10","Leonard: Well, it’s not across the hall."
"10","Sheldon: That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor."
"10","Raj: You’re not going to prison."
"10","Leonard: But, boy, it is funny to think about."
"10","Amy: You really can’t remember anything?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m trying."
"10","Raj: Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone."
"10","Sheldon: Why?"
"10","Raj: Well, it’s, it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went."
"10","Amy: Phones can do that?"
"10","Raj: Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings."
"10","Penny: Oh, that, that’s so cool. How do you, how do you turn that thing off?"
"10","Leonard: Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut."
"10","Penny: I don’t even run there, I drive."
"10","Raj: Hang on, I can see every place you went."
"10","Sheldon: What does it say?"
"10","Raj: Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard."
"10","Sheldon: Where?"
"10","Raj: Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?"
"10","Sheldon: I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe."
"10","Howard: Hey, how’s it going?"
"10","Bernadette: Fine."
"10","Howard: Good. Love you."
"10","Bernadette: Love you, too."
"10","Howard: Love you more."
"10","Bernadette: Okay, you won. Can I finish what I’m doing?"
"10","Howard: Sure, sorry."
"10","Bernadette: Something on your mind?"
"10","Howard: No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe I’m just feeling like something’s bothering you."
"10","Bernadette: Nope, all good."
"10","Howard: Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor."
"10","Bernadette: No, what is wrong with you?"
"10","Howard: Aha, you are upset. I don’t know a lot about women, but I know I upset them."
"10","Bernadette: Howard, I’m sorry if I’m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you."
"10","Howard: It doesn’t?"
"10","Bernadette: No. I didn’t want to tell you, but I’m having a really tough time about going back to work."
"10","Howard: Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back."
"10","Bernadette: It was?"
"10","Howard: Of course. I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day."
"10","Bernadette: I just don’t know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I’m abandoning Halley. If I don’t go, I’m giving up everything I worked for. It’s like there’s no right choice."
"10","Howard: Look, I don’t know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it."
"10","Bernadette: I guess."
"10","Howard: And the best part is Halley won’t remember a thing. Babies are cute, but they’re dumb. I mean, I go like this, she thinks I’m gone, then magically I’m back. I mean honestly, why are we saving for college?"
"10","Bernadette: I’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb."
"10","Howard; Well, she gets it from me. Speaking of which, I have some news about your Aunt Trixie."
"10","Scene: A cowboy bar."
"10","Raj: Does this place look familiar?"
"10","Sheldon: It’s hard to say."
"10","Barman: Hey, Sheldon’s back."
"10","Bar patrons: Sheldon!"
"10","Sheldon: It’s getting clearer."
"10","Barman: You gonna buy another round for the house?"
"10","Sheldon: Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert."
"10","Leonard: Ask him."
"10","Sheldon: Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?"
"10","Raj: These here parts?"
"10","Sheldon: It’s called fitting in. By the way, good luck."
"10","Barman: Here you go."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, thank goodness."
"10","Barman: One top secret quantum guidance system."
"10","Leonard: You understood the math?"
"10","Barman: No, but Sheldon told me all about it. He told everybody."
"10","Leonard: That’s just great."
"10","Barman: Oh, don’t worry, he made us pinky swear we’d keep it a secret."
"10","Flashback"
"10","Sheldon: I swear."
"10","Everyone: I swear:"
"10","Sheldon: Not to tell anyone."
"10","Everyone: Not to tell anyone."
"10","Sheldon: The top secret military information I’m about to tell you."
"10","Everyone: The top secret military information I’m about to tell you."
"10","End of flashback"
"10","Sheldon: We really need to skedaddle. Thank you."
"10","Raj: Bye."
"10","Barman: See you. Should probably erase this."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you for making me tea."
"10","Amy: You’re welcome. How is it?"
"10","Sheldon: Yummy. And warm on my back."
"10","Amy: Do you need anything else?"
"10","Sheldon: You know exactly what I need."
"10","Amy: Fine. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
"10","Sheldon: That’s nice. Now in German."
"10","Amy: Weiches Kätzchen, warmes Kätzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. Liebes Kätzchen, müdes Kätzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt."
"10","Sheldon: Great. Now Mandarin."
"10","Amy: Sings in Mandarin. *"
"10","Sings in Mandarin. *"
"10","Sheldon: Now Navajo."
"10","* (I have been unable to find a proper transcription of the Mandarin lyrics. If anyone who speaks Mandarin is able to send me a full transcription, I will include the lyrics here.)"
"10","Series 10 Episode 21 – The Separation Agitation"
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Sheldon: All right, we’re about to go live, everyone on their A-game, good energy. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
"10","Amy: And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler."
"10","Sheldon: And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we’re calling…"
"10","Together: Fun with Flags: Behind the Flags: A Retrospective."
"10","Howard (singing): Wondering how it all began?"
"10","(singing)"
"10","Raj (singing): You’ll need a good attention span."
"10","Howard (singing): For information and entertainment."
"10","Raj (singing): That’s equally effective."
"10","Together (singing): It’s fun with flags, behind the flags, a retrospective. Flags."
"10","Sheldon: Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don’t literally mean these flags. That’s just where we have dinner."
"10","Amy: Now, I’m sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began."
"10","Sheldon: So let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds."
"10","Amy: Could have played that on my harp."
"10","Sheldon: Just roll the clip. (On voiceover) So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born."
"10","(On voiceover) So"
"10","Leonard: I honestly don’t remember."
"10","Sheldon: Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…"
"10","Penny: Oh, wait. I remember."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, and do you remember what you said?"
"10","Penny: Yes. Please find someone who cares."
"10","Sheldon: And that’s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones."
"10","Amy: Almost 200. Many of them on purpose."
"10","Sheldon: And now we’re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments."
"10","Amy: And don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying. (Long pause) Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags."
"10","(Long pause)"
"10","Bert: Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It’s Bert."
"10","Sheldon: Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?"
"10","Bert: I have a girlfriend."
"10","Amy: And what does that have to do with flags?"
"10","Bert: Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend."
"10","Sheldon: Bert, you’re tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments."
"10","Amy: Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller."
"10","Bert: Her name’s Rebecca."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s van."
"10","Howard: Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? Oh, Howie, I don’t need food as long as I can look at my phone."
"10","Bernadette: I don’t like when you imitate me."
"10","Howard: You want to hear my Stuart? It’s been a while since I’ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?"
"10","Stuart: I said that to you in confidence."
"10","Howard: This is supposed to be our family fun day. What’s so important on your phone?"
"10","Bernadette: I’m on the day care’s website."
"10","Howard: Stop looking at that. The day care’s great. It’s on campus. My office is two minutes away. There’s nothing to worry about."
"10","Bernadette: What if she likes the people who work there more than us?"
"10","Howard: She already likes soap bubbles more than us."
"10","Bernadette: When I go back to work, we’re gonna leave her with these people. We don’t know anything about them."
"10","Howard: They’re highly-trained educators with background checks. They’re even required to be current on all vaccinations."
"10","Stuart: You leave her with me, and I’m not any of those things."
"10","Scene: The cafeteria."
"10","Sheldon: Where’s Howard?"
"10","Raj: He took the day off."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I’ll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I don’t know where I am."
"10","Leonard: So Howard back Monday?"
"10","Raj: Yeah."
"10","Bert: Hey, guys."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, hello."
"10","Leonard: Hey. Want to join us?"
"10","Sheldon: Ah-ah-ah, he’s a geologist, and I have more physics jokes."
"10","Raj: Oh, quick, sit."
"10","Leonard: So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night."
"10","Bert: Sorry. I couldn’t help myself. I guess I just love love."
"10","Raj: Well, I’m very happy for you."
"10","Leonard: Hey, we’re all having dinner tonight. Why don’t the two of you join us?"
"10","Sheldon: Hold on. We don’t know anything about this woman."
"10","Bert: What do you want to know?"
"10","Sheldon: Is she a geologist?"
"10","Bert: No."
"10","Sheldon: Oh great, see you at seven."
"10","Scene: The Zoo."
"10","Howard: How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?"
"10","Stuart: Not a good idea. My hair is a coveted nesting material."
"10","Howard: Learning anything?"
"10","Bernadette: Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. I’m going back to work after only four months, so I’ve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here."
"10","Howard: Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute."
"10","Bernadette: It’s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child."
"10","Stuart: Told you we should have gone to Legoland."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Raj: Can’t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don’t."
"10","Amy: I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career."
"10","Raj: Oh, grow up."
"10","Leonard: Don’t you have any friends he can date?"
"10","Penny: Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life."
"10","Raj: Oh, hey, guys. Come in."
"10","Bert: Thanks. Everyone, this is Rebecca."
"10","Rebecca: Hi."
"10","Leonard: Hey."
"10","Sheldon: She’s younger and far more attractive than he is. They’re copying you two."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Howard: What are you making?"
"10","Stuart: Chicken. Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard."
"10","Howard: Finally get Halley down?"
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, eventually. She’s still not happy about taking a bottle, though."
"10","Howard: Look, if you’re not ready to go back to work, we’ll figure something out."
"10","Bernadette: No, I’ll be fine."
"10","Stuart: It might be good for her. Howard’s mother was around him all the time, and he’s a world-class mama’s boy."
"10","Howard: I mean, why would you say that?"
"10","Stuart: Go ahead, have a tantrum, that’ll prove me wrong."
"10","Bernadette: It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were."
"10","Howard: I guess. It wasn’t until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth."
"10","Stuart: On that charming note, dinner is served."
"10","Penny: So is this your first time dating a scientist? ‘Cause I’m thinking of starting a support group."
"10","Rebecca: Actually, I’m not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist."
"10","Sheldon: Bert, Rebecca. I’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier."
"10","Rebecca: Don’t worry about it. It’s fine."
"10","Sheldon: See? It was fine. I didn’t need a time-out."
"10","Amy: It wasn’t a time-out. Let’s get some food."
"10","Sheldon: You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did."
"10","Amy: Get your food."
"10","Raj: So how did you two meet?"
"10","Rebecca: Oh, it’s such a cute story. We met on a dating Web site."
"10","Leonard: Is that it?"
"10","Rebecca: Oh, sorry. The end."
"10","Raj: That’s nice. I haven’t had much success meeting people online."
"10","Bert: I didn’t either, until I revamped my profile."
"10","Sheldon: What’d you do, delete your photo?"
"10","Amy: Go."
"10","Sheldon: Fine."
"10","Amy: And don’t you slam that door."
"10","Sheldon: Aw, man."
"10","Rebecca: Did I say something wrong?"
"10","Leonard: No, it’s always him."
"10","Penny: , Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?"
"10","Bert: Right. I wasn’t getting any responses, and then I added recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner, and five minutes later I met my soul mate."
"10","Amy: I was wrong. You can come back in."
"10","Leonard: So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?"
"10","Rebecca: I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn’t really work out."
"10","Sheldon: I’d say she’s copying you again, but I’m getting tired of sitting in the hall."
"10","Raj: I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home."
"10","Rebecca: I could give you some free sessions."
"10","Penny: Oh, is that offer for everybody?"
"10","Leonard: Nice try. I’m not going."
"10","Rebecca: Where’s your bathroom?"
"10","Leonard: Mm, just down there."
"10","Bert: She’s so perfect, sometimes I think she isn’t real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is."
"10","Penny: Aw, that’s so weird."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry, Bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?"
"10","Bert: She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen."
"10","Sheldon: Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?"
"10","Penny: You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel."
"10","Leonard: And we lived happily ever after."
"10","Penny: The end."
"10","Bernadette: Well, guess I’m ready to go."
"10","Howard: Have a great first day back."
"10","Bernadette: You have everything she needs for day care?"
"10","Stuart: Yep, all in the bag."
"10","Bernadette: Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today."
"10","Howard: I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out."
"10","Stuart: Bye, cutie. I’m gonna miss you. I’m gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home."
"10","Bernadette: Stop, you’re gonna make me cry."
"10","Howard: Great, now everybody’s crying."
"10","Stuart: At least Halley’s not."
"10","Howard: That’s good."
"10","Bernadette: She’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care."
"10","Sheldon: Who’s ready to laugh?"
"10","Leonard: O-o-o-o-oh."
"10","Sheldon: Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears"
"10","we’re inside a joke. Einstein replies, but only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously. To which Schrodinger says, if someone’s looking in the window, I’m leaving."
"10","Leonard: That’s actually funny."
"10","Raj: You should send that to Jimmy Fallon."
"10","Bert: Hey."
"10","Leonard: Oh, hello. Join us."
"10","Raj: Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward."
"10","Bert: Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn’t flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca."
"10","Leonard: Wow, that’s a big step."
"10","Raj: I think it shows a lot of character."
"10","Bert: I’m gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me."
"10","Sheldon: That’s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke."
"10","Scene: The daycare."
"10","Bernadette (on phone): How’s she doing?"
"10","(on phone)"
"10","Howard: She’s great. Look."
"10","Bernadette: I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is."
"10","Howard: See? Nothing to worry about."
"10","Bernadette: Thank you. Okay, I’m gonna try and get some work done."
"10","Howard: Yeah, me, too. Love you."
"10","Bernadette: Love you, too. Bye."
"10","Stuart: How is she?"
"10","Howard: What are you doing here?"
"10","Stuart: Can’t a guy hang out at a college he doesn’t go to and stare at a baby that isn’t his?"
"10","Howard: I get it. I haven’t even made it to my office yet."
"10","Stuart: Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?"
"10","Howard: Probably. We should go."
"10","Stuart: Yeah. Or we could take her to the aquarium."
"10","Howard: I’ll get her, you grab her bag."
"10","Stuart: Hang on, Halley, we’re busting you out of there."
"10","Amy: What are you looking at?"
"10","Sheldon: Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet."
"10","Bert: Hello? Anybody home?"
"10","Leonard: Is that Bert?"
"10","Bert: It’s Bert."
"10","Penny: I think it’s Bert."
"10","Raj: Hey, what’s up?"
"10","Bert: I broke up with Rebecca."
"10","Penny: Oh."
"10","Amy: Oh. You know, good for you."
"10","Bert: No, I miss her. I don’t know why I listened to you."
"10","Sheldon: He’s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love."
"10","Amy: You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now."
"10","Penny: Bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money."
"10","Bert: She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one doing that is me."
"10","Leonard: If you’re that upset, go get her back."
"10","Bert: I tried. She’s not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone. I made a huge mistake."
"10","Raj: No, you didn’t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now."
"10","Penny: Look, sweetie, relationships aren’t about money, okay? It’s about respect and having things in common and… yes, Sheldon?"
"10","Sheldon: You and Leonard don’t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up."
"10","Leonard: You called on him."
"10","Stuart: Guess who’s home from day care?"
"10","Howard: It’s Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid’s foot."
"10","Bernadette: You realize they called when you took her."
"10","Howard: Guess who’s home from the aquarium?"
"10","Bert: Sorry again for barging in."
"10","Leonard: You don’t have to go. You’re welcome to hang with us."
"10","Sheldon: Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. Unless it’s Raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour."
"10","Bert: You guys are nice, but I’m just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back."
"10","Raj: I feel bad for Bert."
"10","Sheldon: So he’s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?"
"10","Leonard: It’s totally different. Bert’s money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time."
"10","Penny: All that and he’s shorter than me."
"10","Raj: Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body."
"10","Raj: Really?"
"10","Amy: Relax. We’re the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ."
"10","Howard: She does look happy."
"10","Bernadette: See? This is the right thing for her. Let’s all just go to work."
"10","Stuart: Any time."
"10","Bernadette: Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go."
"10","Sheldon: Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
"10","Sheldon: Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together."
"10","Amy: So welcome to tonight’s episode,"
"10","Together: Fun with Flags: Behind the Behind the Flags: A Retrospective Retrospective."
"10","Sheldon: Ooh, we already have our first call."
"10","Amy: Oh. Hello, you’re on Fun with Flags."
"10","Bert: The Jet Ski worked. I got her back."
"10","Series 10 Episode 22 – The Cognition Regeneration"
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Leonard: We’re pinned down."
"10","Howard: We can’t get through."
"10","Raj: Sheldon, get over here and help."
"10","Sheldon: Okay, one second."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m trying to shoot."
"10","Howard: Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button."
"10","Leonard: Aw."
"10","Raj: That’s it, we’re dead."
"10","Howard: Okay, challenge them again."
"10","Leonard: Doing it right now. Oh, they can’t. There’s an important Little League game tomorrow."
"10","Howard: No wonder they beat us, they’re jocks."
"10","Sheldon: What happened to me? I used to excel at these things."
"10","Howard: Kids are always better at video games."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I don’t like it."
"10","Leonard: Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child."
"10","Sheldon: No, but it’s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone."
"10","Howard: Oh, so our love is not real?"
"10","Raj: Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room."
"10","Sheldon: I guess I just need to face it, I’m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what’s for lunch."
"10","Leonard: Hot dogs."
"10","Sheldon: Yay."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: A bar."
"10","Penny: I didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production."
"10","Amy: I’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check."
"10","Bernadette: Ruin it for me and I’ll break this glass over your head."
"10","Amy: To denial."
"10","Penny: Ooh. I’m gonna get another. You want food?"
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone."
"10","Zack: Penny?"
"10","Penny: Oh, Zack. Hey."
"10","Zack: What are the odds of running into you here?"
"10","Penny: Well, it’s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what’s new?"
"10","Zack: Oh, tons of stuff. Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie."
"10","Penny: Well, congratulations."
"10","Zack: That’s what my dermatologist said."
"10","Penny: No, on, on getting engaged, good for you."
"10","Zack: Oh, thanks. How about you? Hey, how’s Leonard? Is he still smart?"
"10","Penny: Yes, yes, he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he’s not even here."
"10","Zack: I love that little guy. Hey, we should all have dinner sometime."
"10","Penny: Uh, yeah, sure, I’ll check with Leonard."
"10","Zack: Cool, I’ll check with Sara. Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me."
"10","Scene: The comic book store."
"10","Sheldon: I’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation."
"10","Leonard: You’re gonna have to be more specific."
"10","Sheldon: At the hands of those teenagers."
"10","Leonard: More."
"10","Sheldon: Boy teenagers."
"10","Leonard: Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad."
"10","Sheldon: I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging."
"10","Raj: You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?"
"10","Howard: Now, this is rare. I don’t know which one of you I want to stop talking first."
"10","Sheldon: The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."
"10","Raj: Like J-Lo’s hair."
"10","Howard: Boy, it is neck and neck right now."
"10","Leonard: How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion."
"10","Leonard: I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk."
"10","Raj: If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi."
"10","Sheldon: Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha. (I did that when I was eight)"
"10","Raj: Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi."
"10","Penny: Hey, you ready to go?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah, I guess."
"10","Penny: What’s the matter?"
"10","Leonard: Honestly? It’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about."
"10","Penny: What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it."
"10","Leonard: It’ll be fine, let’s just go."
"10","Penny: Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding."
"10","Leonard: Aaargh."
"10","Penny: Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2."
"10","Leonard: Ha, I knew you weren’t asleep."
"10","Scene: A restaurant."
"10","Zack: Hey, guys."
"10","Penny: Hi. Hey, where’s your fiancée?"
"10","Zack: Oh, she couldn’t make it. She had an emergency."
"10","Penny: Oh, no, what happened?"
"10","Zack: I didn’t ask."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Hey."
"10","Sheldon: Hey."
"10","Raj: Hey."
"10","Amy: What smells so good?"
"10","Sheldon: Raj is teaching me to make croissants."
"10","Amy: Is this part of your super-aging?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control."
"10","Raj: Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these."
"10","Sheldon: Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can’t I do?"
"10","Amy: Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills."
"10","Sheldon: For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you."
"10","Raj: You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these."
"10","Sheldon: You’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever."
"10","Raj: Damn it, he’s good at that, too."
"10","Scene: The restaurant."
"10","Zack: Thanks. Wow, working on a top secret government project, that is so cool. Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?"
"10","Leonard: I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away."
"10","Zack: I miss that guy. He’s like the Swedish Chef Muppet. I don’t know what he’s saying, but he’s funny."
"10","Leonard: Oh, I know what he’s saying, and he’s not, he’s not funny."
"10","Zack: So, Penny, what’s going on with you? How’s the job?"
"10","Penny: Uh, it’s okay, I’m still in pharmaceutical sales."
"10","Leonard: She’s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success."
"10","Penny: Yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I’m not crazy about a lot of it."
"10","Zack: Hey, if you’re not happy there, I’ve been looking for a new head of sales at my company. And we don’t sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you’ll be telling is we print on recycled paper. We don’t."
"10","Penny: Oh, that’s a nice offer."
"10","Zack: You know, we’d make a great team. Or as we say in the menu business, I can’t do this without Me N U."
"10","Penny: Right, ’cause it spells menu."
"10","Zack: Yeah, right? It’s funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that’s my favourite."
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"10","Howard: All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?"
"10","Sheldon: It really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging."
"10","Howard: Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic."
"10","Sheldon: Howard, I’m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else."
"10","Bernadette: So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?"
"10","Howard: Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?"
"10","Bernadette: Yes, I’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now."
"10","Howard: And it’s hard, isn’t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?"
"10","Sheldon: Okay, I think I got that."
"10","Howard: Uh, hold on. There’s an old saying in juggling."
"10","Bernadette: Is it I’m going to die alone?"
"10","Howard: No, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it."
"10","Sheldon: Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?"
"10","Howard: No."
"10","Sheldon: Are you sure? ‘Cause I’m feeling a twinge."
"10","Scene: Penny’s car."
"10","Penny: See, that wasn’t so bad. He even picked up the check."
"10","Leonard: Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I’m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You’re not really considering working for him, are you?"
"10","Penny: Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat."
"10","Leonard: Don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?"
"10","Penny: You work with Sheldon, you tell me."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, it’s weird."
"10","Penny: Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?"
"10","Leonard: No, no, I’m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers."
"10","Penny: Great, so you want me to stay at a job I’m not happy at?"
"10","Leonard: Uh."
"10","Penny: You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip."
"10","Leonard: Of course I don’t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. You don’t have to stop, just slow down, I’ll jump out."
"10","Sheldon: Amy, look, I’m on a unicycle!"
"10","Amy: How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?"
"10","Sheldon: I hurt myself juggling."
"10","Amy: Where did you get it?"
"10","Sheldon: Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever."
"10","Amy: Have you tried letting go of the rope?"
"10","Sheldon: What, are you crazy? I’m on a unicycle."
"10","Amy: All right, well, have fun."
"10","Sheldon: Wait, I need help getting down."
"10","Amy: Well, what do you want me to do?"
"10","Sheldon: Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose."
"10","Howard: So you told her she was being dumb?"
"10","Leonard: No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb."
"10","Raj: Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?"
"10","Leonard: We covered this, I’m dumb."
"10","Penny: So he’s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can’t believe Leonard would be so insecure."
"10","Bernadette: Really? I have no trouble believing that at all."
"10","Penny: And Zack’s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened."
"10","Bernadette: We’re talking about the same Leonard, right?"
"10","Leonard: So you think it’s fine if she works for Zack?"
"10","Howard: I don’t know, maybe."
"10","Raj: Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard."
"10","Howard: Yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack."
"10","Howard: Again."
"10","Bernadette: I would never let Howard work with an ex."
"10","Penny: What, you wouldn’t trust him?"
"10","Bernadette: I wouldn’t trust her. He’s thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound."
"10","Penny: Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog."
"10","Bernadette: And I’d like to think Howie wouldn’t take a job I was uncomfortable with."
"10","Penny: ‘Cause he’s scared of you?"
"10","Bernadette: Terrified."
"10","Penny: Yeah."
"10","Howard: You know what? I’m with Leonard, this isn’t cool."
"10","Leonard: Thank you."
"10","Raj: I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she’ll push back."
"10","Leonard: So you think it’s okay?"
"10","Raj: Oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with."
"10","Amy: What are you doing?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m returning this stuff to Howard."
"10","Amy: Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
"10","Amy: You said juggling was dumb, too."
"10","Sheldon: Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I’d wear cargo pants."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?"
"10","Sheldon: Are you calling me a quitter?"
"10","Amy: Well, if you honestly…"
"10","Sheldon: This conversation is over."
"10","Amy: His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me."
"10","Penny: Hey."
"10","Leonard: Hi."
"10","Penny: You want to talk?"
"10","Leonard: That doesn’t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?"
"10","Penny: Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex, and I don’t like it now."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, sorry."
"10","Penny: Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable."
"10","Leonard: Well, thanks. And I don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like."
"10","Penny: Then what do we do?"
"10","Leonard: Well, I don’t love it, but if you really want to take this job, I’ll find a way to deal with it."
"10","Penny: No, I know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now."
"10","Leonard: No, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, I’ll just, I’ll suck it up."
"10","Penny: You don’t need to do that, it’s okay."
"10","Leonard: Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom."
"10","Amy: I made you tea."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you."
"10","Amy: I’m sorry I called you a quitter."
"10","Sheldon: It’s okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me."
"10","Amy: What are you reading?"
"10","Sheldon: This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40."
"10","Amy: So?"
"10","Sheldon: So I’m running out of time."
"10","Amy: That’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, you have to say that, you’re sweet on me."
"10","Amy: Well, if you’re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, I thought you were sweet on me."
"10","Amy: Okay, fine, let’s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?"
"10","Sheldon: You’re so cute. I’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts."
"10","Amy: So many warnings."
"10","Penny: Okay, are you sure about this?"
"10","Leonard: Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I’m being."
"10","Zack (on phone): Penny, what’s up?"
"10","(on phone)"
"10","Penny: Hey, uh, so I’ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job."
"10","Zack: Oh, bad news. When my fiancée found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me."
"10","Penny: Oh, so there’s no job?"
"10","Zack: Nope, just a little bump on my forehead."
"10","Penny: Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren’t you gonna say anything?"
"10","Leonard: Not if I want to be doing this later."
"10","Bernadette: Hey, I didn’t know you were home. Where you been?"
"10","Howard: I went to see your mom."
"10","Bernadette: Seriously, where were you?"
"10","Howard: I just told you, your mom’s."
"10","Bernadette: Why?"
"10","Howard: Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid."
"10","Bernadette: Oh. What’d she say?"
"10","Howard: She didn’t say much of anything. But she said a lot. (Through ventriloquist’s doll) Hi, Bernadette, remember me?"
"10","(Through ventriloquist’s doll)"
"10","Bernadette: First of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from South Carolina."
"10","Howard: I can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist."
"10","Bernadette: Okay, it’s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant."
"10","Howard: Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper."
"10","Bernadette: No. And the little lady has a name."
"10","Howard: Which is?"
"10","Bernadette: Tammy Jo St. Cloud."
"10","Howard: Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I’m a dork for juggling."
"10","Bernadette: Sorry, you’re not a dork. (Through doll) You’re a clown. (Bernadette) Tammy Jo, don’t say that, you’ll make him feel bad. (Doll) Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?"
"10","(Through doll)"
"10","(Bernadette)"
"10","(Doll)"
"10","Howard: All right, very funny."
"10","Bernadette: Don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years. (Doll) Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable."
"10","Howard: That’s enough, put her away."
"10","Bernadette (as Doll): Oh, big daddy, I don’t think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now."
"10","(as Doll)"
"10","Howard: All right, you’re freaking me out."
"10","Bernadette (as Doll): Don’t be that way. If you don’t mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. Ooh."
"10","Scene: A street."
"10","Sheldon: I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m tall and I’m doing it. (Waking up in bed) Ah, man."

"10","Series 10 Episode 23 – The Gyroscopic Collapse"
"10","After a “previously on” segment."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Penny: Champagne, champagne."
"10","Leonard: Thank you."
"10","Penny: And for the world’s tallest second grader, apple juice."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you. No bendy straw, some party."
"10","Leonard: Hey, a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers."
"10","All: Cheers."
"10","Amy: You know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, you guys did this all on your own."
"10","Raj: Without me."
"10","Sheldon: To success without Raj."
"10","Bernadette: So what happens next?"
"10","Howard: Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah, I’ll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C."
"10","Leonard: First thing tomorrow morning, we’re back at it."
"10","Sheldon: I hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer."
"10","Scene: Outside the lab."
"10","Computer Voice: Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted."
"10","Leonard: Hmm. I don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. Now, before we field test, I think we…"
"10","Howard: What the hell?"
"10","Leonard: Where is everything?"
"10","Sheldon: Who else has access to this room?"
"10","Leonard: It’s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us."
"10","Sheldon: This is disconcerting."
"10","Howard: But the movie did just get good."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The laboratory ."
"10","Leonard: Sir, I, I, I’m sorry but I just don’t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?"
"10","Col. Williams: Sounds like you get it."
"10","Howard: But why would you do that?"
"10","Col. Williams: You guys completed phase one, we’ll take it from here."
"10","Sheldon: Where did you move it?"
"10","Col. Williams: I can’t tell you that."
"10","Leonard: Are you implementing phase two?"
"10","Sheldon: Wait, so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?"
"10","Col: Williams: That one I can tell you, yes."
"10","Howard: This is all very upsetting."
"10","Col. Williams: I’m sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is people’s feelings."
"10","Sheldon: If that’s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies."
"10","Raj: I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live."
"10","Penny: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that."
"10","Raj: Really? You kept sending me apartment listings."
"10","Penny: Um, well, I, yeah, you got me."
"10","Amy: Where are you moving?"
"10","Penny: And when? But also where?"
"10","Raj: Bert has a room for rent."
"10","Bernadette: So you’re gonna be roommates with Bert?"
"10","Raj: Uh, no, it’s, uh, pretty private, actually, it’s over his garage. So the only time I’ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room."
"10","Amy: Well, good for you. I actually have a little news myself."
"10","Penny: Okay, we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out? Okay, that’s cool."
"10","Amy: I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton."
"10","Bernadette: Hey, that’s amazing."
"10","Penny: Good for you."
"10","Raj: Congratulations."
"10","Amy: Thanks, but the thing is I’ll be gone for a few months and I don’t know how Sheldon’s gonna feel about that."
"10","Penny: Oh, come on, he’s a grown man, he can take care of himself."
"10","Amy: You really believe that?"
"10","Penny: Once again, you got me."
"10","Scene: The stairwell."
"10","Howard: How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?"
"10","Leonard: I can’t believe the Air Force would treat us like that."
"10","Sheldon: You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives."
"10","Leonard: Third floor, wrong apartment."
"10","Howard: Although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be Penny."
"10","Leonard: She might disappear, but she’s definitely not cleaning anything."
"10","Sheldon: It’s okay, everything’s here."
"10","Penny: Oh, hey, what’s going on?"
"10","Leonard: You won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project."
"10","Penny: What?"
"10","Bernadette: You’re kidding. Why would they do that?"
"10","Howard: They wouldn’t say."
"10","Sheldon: I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he’s the other kind."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, I’m so sorry."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah, what’s going on with you guys?"
"10","Howard: Give us some good news."
"10","Penny: Amy’s got some news."
"10","Amy: Yeah, um, Raj is moving out."
"10","Leonard: Oh, no. When?"
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s van."
"10","Bernadette: You doing okay?"
"10","Howard: Not really."
"10","Bernadette: Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better."
"10","Howard: No. Then you’ll get all sexed up and I’m not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted."
"10","Bernadette: You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year."
"10","Howard: Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world."
"10","Bernadette: Really? That’s the importance you put on us having a baby?"
"10","Howard: I’m happy about it, but, I mean, it’s not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you."
"10","Penny (on phone): So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?"
"10","(on phone)"
"10","Amy: No, I’m waiting till he’s in a good mood."
"10","Penny: Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long."
"10","Amy: I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t go."
"10","Penny: Oh, stop it, he’ll be fine."
"10","Amy: I guess. And he’ll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time."
"10","Penny; Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn’t go."
"10","Amy: Got to go. Morning."
"10","Sheldon: I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time."
"10","Amy: Are you feeling okay?"
"10","Sheldon: Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular."
"10","Amy: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that."
"10","Sheldon: No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail."
"10","Amy: Oh, the more details, the more sorry. Well, maybe this’ll cheer you up. I made your favorite oatmeal, plain."
"10","Sheldon: What’s the occasion?"
"10","Amy: No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you."
"10","Sheldon: You’re so kind. You know, I don’t know how I ever got by without you."
"10","Amy: Oh. That’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I thought that, too, but I’ve come to realize, I am completely dependent on you."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, you’re, you’re being silly."
"10","Sheldon: No, to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?"
"10","Amy: You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new."
"10","Sheldon: Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that."
"10","Amy: Oh, I don’t know, I mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks."
"10","Sheldon: I’m confused. You’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me."
"10","Amy: That is true, I have said that."
"10","Sheldon: Well, a lot, it’s very annoying. Has something changed? Um, is there something that you’re not telling me?"
"10","Amy: I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton."
"10","Sheldon: Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill."
"10","Amy: Yeah, that’s the one."
"10","Sheldon: Well, that’s wonderful. Congratulations."
"10","Amy: Well, I haven’t accepted it yet. I wanted to talk to you first."
"10","Sheldon: What is there to talk about? You have to take it. It’s important."
"10","Amy: So are you."
"10","Sheldon: Thank you, but I’ll be fine."
"10","Amy: Are, are you sure?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too."
"10","Scene: A park."
"10","Bernadette: Really? He doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?"
"10","Amy: I don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story."
"10","Penny: I mean, I like a little brown sugar."
"10","Amy: Guys."
"10","Penny: Sorry."
"10","Bernadette: You’re still gonna go, right?"
"10","Amy: I don’t know. Sheldon’s so vulnerable right now."
"10","Penny: Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he’d be on the first train to New Jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one."
"10","Bernadette: Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram."
"10","Penny: Well, what’s wrong with that?"
"10","Bernadette: No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage."
"10","Penny: And yet you bore his child. Neato."
"10","Bernadette: You’re excited about this opportunity, right?"
"10","Amy: Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…"
"10","Penny: Okay, a simple yes will do."
"10","Bernadette: You have to go."
"10","Amy: I know, but what if Sheldon…"
"10","Penny: Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It’s not like you two are very physical."
"10","Amy: Hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors."
"10","Penny: A lot of lectures?"
"10","Amy: All right, so you know."
"10","Bernadette: I’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it."
"10","Howard: Hey, wait up."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, great."
"10","Howard: You left something at home. A big hug."
"10","Bernadette: Oh."
"10","Howard: I found it right next to these kisses."
"10","Bernadette: It’s too late for me. Save yourself."
"10","Leonard: So, are you excited to have your own place again?"
"10","Raj: I am, but I’ll miss you guys."
"10","Leonard: Ah, we’ll miss you, too."
"10","Raj: You could try saying that without smiling."
"10","Leonard: I’m trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?"
"10","Sheldon: What does it look like? I’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart."
"10","Raj: Why?"
"10","Sheldon: I got the blues. My baby done left me."
"10","Raj: Come on, Sheldon. Amy’s only gone for a few months. And now that I’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want."
"10","Leonard: Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?"
"10","Raj: Yeah, sure."
"10","Leonard: Sheldon, you’re being silly."
"10","Sheldon: Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall."
"10","Leonard: Do you really care about that last one?"
"10","Sheldon: No, but that list was sounding a little thin."
"10","Leonard: Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend."
"10","Sheldon: So trick her."
"10","Leonard: All right, let me start again. Uh, you and Amy…"
"10","Raj (outside): Can I get my stuff? Sounds like it’s gonna be a while."
"10","(outside)"
"10","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom."
"10","Howard: I missed you."
"10","Bernadette: Come here, let’s talk."
"10","Howard: Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking ’cause you know."
"10","Bernadette: Just listen. I don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure."
"10","Howard: Oh."
"10","Bernadette: A little clingy."
"10","Howard: I know and I’m sorry."
"10","Bernadette: Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place."
"10","Howard: Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?"
"10","Bernadette: I signed us up for ballroom dance class."
"10","Howard: Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?"
"10","Bernadette: I made us have a baby."
"10","Howard: So?"
"10","Bernadette: Bring it in."
"10","Howard: And now the movie just got rated R."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Amy: Hey. You going somewhere?"
"10","Sheldon: No, but you are, so I got you this as a present."
"10","Amy: Sheldon, that isn’t necessary."
"10","Sheldon: No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me that I’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage."
"10","Amy: Thank you."
"10","Sheldon: The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it."
"10","Amy: Does this mean you’re okay with me going?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. Uh, I know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…"
"10","Amy: I am."
"10","Sheldon: Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, I’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going."
"10","Amy: I wasn’t thinking that."
"10","Sheldon: Well, no, it’s just, I’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I can’t Skype it to you."
"10","Amy: That’s a risk I’m willing to take."
"10","Sheldon: All right, then. Let’s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking."
"10","Amy: What if we don’t fold our clothes at all?"
"10","Sheldon: Or, what if we fold them?"
"10","Scene: The apartment doorway."
"10","Raj: Well, here’s your key back."
"10","Raj: As soon as I have the place set up I’m gonna have you guys over."
"10","Penny: Oh, we would love that."
"10","Raj: I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life."
"10","Sheldon (off): Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen."
"10","(off)"
"10","Raj: Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends"
"10","like you…"
"10","Amy (off): My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient."
"10","(off):"
"10","Raj: I can’t compete with that. Bye."
"10","Leonard: Should we give them their privacy?"
"10","Penny: I want to, but I don’t think I can."
"10","Sheldon (off): Whoopee!"
"10","Penny: Okay, I’m good now."
"10","Amy: Okay, the car is waiting. Do you want to walk me downstairs?"
"10","Sheldon: Of course. Here, here, let me. I’ve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod."
"10","Amy: Is it?"
"10","Sheldon: Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve."
"10","Amy: Do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?"
"10","Sheldon: It’s hard to say. I’ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?"
"10","Amy: I’ll love you no matter what."
"10","Sheldon: Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles."
"10","Amy: We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it."
"10","Sheldon: And you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport?"
"10","Amy: I will."
"10","Sheldon: And when you’re at the gate?"
"10","Amy: Uh-huh."
"10","Sheldon: And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?"
"10","Amy: I don’t know what they look like, but sure."
"10","Sheldon: And don’t forget to Skype me when you arrive."
"10","Amy: I won’t."
"10","Sheldon: And every morning."
"10","Amy: Got it."
"10","Sheldon: Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello."
"10","Amy: Good thinking."
"10","Sheldon: And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do."
"10","Amy: Thank you. That means a lot."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately."
"10","Series 10 Episode 24 – The Long Distance Dissonance"
"10","Following a “previously on” sequence."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy on skype."
"10","Sheldon: How are you settling in?"
"10","Amy: Pretty well. Princeton has a beautiful campus."
"10","Sheldon: Now, I’ve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They’re both shocking."
"10","Amy: Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, I’m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, I’ll tell you that."
"10","Amy: I miss you."
"10","Sheldon: I miss you, too."
"10","Amy: It’s so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar."
"10","Sheldon: I’m sorry you had to go through that."
"10","Amy: In fact, that’s when I started to really miss you."
"10","Sheldon: You know you just split an infinitive."
"10","Amy: Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?"
"10","Sheldon: I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem."
"10","Amy: What are you gonna do about it?"
"10","Sheldon: I’m going to admonish you."
"10","Amy: Vigorously?"
"10","Sheldon: That’s the only kind of admonishing I do."
"10","Credits sequence."
"10","Scene: The cafeteria."
"10","Howard: How’s Sheldon doing with Amy gone?"
"10","Leonard: Well, the last three nights I’ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. Now ask me how I’m doing with Amy gone."
"10","Raj: How are you doing with…"
"10","Leonard: Shut up."
"10","Howard: If you’d like, we can help you out."
"10","Leonard: Oh, that would be great."
"10","Howard: I mean, not me, I’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram."
"10","Raj: It was a tutorial. And yes, I’m happy to keep Sheldon company."
"10","Leonard: Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot."
"10","Raj: Oh, why does he need a ladder?"
"10","Leonard: He doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book."
"10","Sheldon: Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki, She’s back at Caltech for her postdoc."
"10","Ramona Nowitzki: Hello."
"10","Leonard: Hello."
"10","Raj: Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone."
"10","Leonard: Oh. I love those."
"10","Sheldon: Let’s sit somewhere else."
"10","Raj: What just happened?"
"10","Howard: A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar."
"10","Leonard: Wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?"
"10","Howard: Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts."
"10","Raj: So what do you guys think that’s about?"
"10","Leonard: Knowing Sheldon, nothing."
"10","Sheldon: So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."
"10","Ramona: Not ’til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory."
"10","Sheldon: Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people."
"10","Leonard: He just made her laugh, something’s wrong."
"10","Raj: Do you see the way she’s looking at him?"
"10","Howard: Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me."
"10","Raj: I keep telling you, close the bathroom door."
"10","Leonard: Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?"
"10","Howard: Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one."
"10","Raj: Which is?"
"10","Howard: That ain’t Sheldon."
"10","Scene: The apartment."
"10","Penny: Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh."
"10","Bernadette: That’s nothing, Howie said she touched his hand."
"10","Penny: Did he Purell?"
"10","Bernadette: No."
"10","Penny: I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out."
"10","Bernadette: Should we call Amy?"
"10","Penny: I don’t know; we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing."
"10","Bernadette: I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl."
"10","Penny: Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon’s sexual appetite?"
"10","Bernadette: Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?"
"10","Penny: All right, then we agree. He’s not making any moves, it’s this Dr. Ramona chick."
"10","Bernadette: Nowitzki. I googled her, she’s pretty cute."
"10","Penny: Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts."
"10","Sheldon: And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain."
"10","Amy: Sounds like a big night."
"10","Sheldon: Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"
"10","Amy: So you’re keeping busy? You’re not lonely?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch"
"10","with Dr. Nowitzki."
"10","Amy: Who’s he?"
"10","Sheldon: Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman."
"10","Amy: Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?"
"10","Sheldon: Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at Caltech."
"10","Amy: Huge fan, you say?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes. I think you’d like her. She’s extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer."
"10","Amy: That’s terrific. I’ll call you right back."
"10","Penny (answering skype): Oh, hey, Amy."
"10","(answering skype)"
"10","Amy: I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?"
"10","Penny: We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic."
"10","Bernadette: Which he only did once."
"10","Amy: Why didn’t you tell me?"
"10","Bernadette: We didn’t want you to worry."
"10","Amy: Should I worry?"
"10","Penny: No. Come on, it’s Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen."
"10","Amy: That’s what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months."
"10","Amy: You don’t get it. I’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries."
"10","Penny: Well, what do you want us to do?"
"10","Amy: I don’t know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear."
"10","Bernadette: That’s ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
"10","Amy: Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer."
"10","Penny: Come on. Looks don’t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you."
"10","Amy: Nice try."
"10","Penny: Thanks. I was scrambling."
"10","Scene: The comic book store."
"10","Howard: It’s unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me."
"10","Leonard: Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I’m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars."
"10","Raj: Can you even eat those things?"
"10","Leonard: If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after."
"10","Raj: Sounds like a lot of work."
"10","Leonard: Eh, I’m worth it."
"10","Howard: Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?"
"10","Leonard: Like what?"
"10","Raj: Uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into Sheldon."
"10","Stuart: I’ll do it."
"10","Leonard: No offence, Stuart, but the woman’s a doctor."
"10","Stuart: So? Doctors like me. Whenever I see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look."
"10","Howard: She’s not that kind of doctor."
"10","Stuart: Oh. Well, her loss. I’ve been called a genuine medical oddity."
"10","Raj: Actually, I was going to suggest me."
"10","Howard: Great. Anybody’s better than, mmm."
"10","Stuart: Excuse me. They took out my spleen and gallbladder, not my feelings."
"10","Raj: Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you."
"10","Ramona: Good to see you, too."
"10","Raj: May I join you?"
"10","Ramona: No."
"10","Raj: Good to see you."
"10","Howard: We should call Guinness, that might be a record."
"10","Raj: She’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone."
"10","Ramona: Dr. Cooper, over here."
"10","Raj: I could have made her very happy."
"10","Leonard: You kept walking. I think you did."
"10","Penny: Do you really think there’s reason to worry?"
"10","Leonard: Yeah, she’s definitely going after Sheldon."
"10","Raj: I made a play for her and she shot me down."
"10","Penny: All right, well, that doesn’t prove anything."
"10","Bernadette: Yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down."
"10","Raj: Like, really, a million?"
"10","Bernadette: Fine, hundreds."
"10","Raj: Thank you."
"10","Penny: The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki."
"10","Ramona: Hi."
"10","All; Hi."
"10","Sheldon: We just went swimming."
"10","Scene: The same, later."
"10","Leonard: And you actually got in a pool?"
"10","Sheldon: I was scared, but I told myself it’s just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub."
"10","Ramona: I was proud of him, a lot of people don’t put their face in the water on the first day."
"10","Sheldon: Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts."
"10","Bernadette: Can I just squeeze in here?"
"10","Penny: So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?"
"10","Sheldon: Yes, we skyped this morning and I’m sure I’ll check in with her before I go to sleep."
"10","Ramona: Sheldon talks about her all the time. I can’t wait to meet her."
"10","Sheldon: That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy’s going to be gone."
"10","Leonard: Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?"
"10","Sheldon: Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?"
"10","Ramona: No, my work doesn’t leave me a lot of time for relationships."
"10","Raj: I think you made that very clear."
"10","Sheldon: She was part of the American team at CERN."
"10","Ramona: I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson."
"10","Sheldon: Do you know, I’ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?"
"10","Ramona: Absolutely."
"10","Sheldon: I’ll get them."
"10","Ramona: Well, hang on, I’ll come with you."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, fun. Like a play date."
"10","Penny: Okay, correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?"
"10","Bernadette: I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
"10","Leonard: You think you should call Amy?"
"10","Penny: You got fingers and a mouth, you call her."
"10","Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment."
"10","Sheldon: Here you go."
"10","Ramona: Are these all from Peter Higgs?"
"10","Sheldon: Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. They’re from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me."
"10","Amy: Hello, Sheldon."
"10","Sheldon: Oh, hello, Amy."
"10","Amy: I was missing you again."
"10","Sheldon: I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She’s right here."
"10","Amy: She’s what?"
"10","Ramona: Hello."
"10","Amy: Hi."
"10","Ramona: So nice to meet you."
"10","Amy: Uh-huh. Hang on. (answering phone) Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry."
"10","(answering phone)"
"10","Sheldon: What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?"
"10","Amy: It’s not important."
"10","Sheldon: I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don’t you agree?"
"10","Ramona: I do."
"10","Sheldon: See? We both think so."
"10","Penny: All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody’s got to go over there."
"10","Leonard: You got feet and legs, you do it."
"10","Penny: Will you go with me?"
"10","Bernadette: To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?"
"10","Raj: We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper."
"10","Howard: You done trying to make yourself feel better?"
"10","Raj: No. I haven’t played the race card yet."
"10","Sheldon: Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says I’m tired and have to go to bed."
"10","Ramona: It was nice seeing everybody. Thank you for dinner."
"10","Penny: Sure."
"10","Leonard: Our pleasure."
"10","Raj: Whatever."
"10","Ramona: Walk me to my car?"
"10","Sheldon: Of course."
"10","Penny: We’ll all go."
"10","Bernadette: Excuse me."
"10","Penny: Pardon. I just need to., yeah."
"10","Sheldon: That was fun. It was like Mario Kart."
"10","Scene: The street."
"10","Sheldon: Bye."
"10","Penny: We need to talk."
"10","Sheldon: What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don’t like it either."
"10","Penny: Okay, I know you don’t have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you."
"10","Sheldon: That doesn’t make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend."
"10","Penny: Well, sometimes women don’t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more."
"10","Sheldon: That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzki’s just a friend. In fact, I wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom."
"10","Penny: Okay. Um, let’s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect."
"10","Sheldon: I already do."
"10","Penny: Well, then you get it."
"10","Sheldon: Because there’s only one of me, I’m more valuable."
"10","Penny: Right."
"10","Sheldon: Although, Amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me."
"10","Penny: Let’s forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe…"
"10","Sheldon: Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I don’t think that’s what’s happening."
"10","Penny: All right. What do you think is happening?"
"10","Sheldon: I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill."
"10","Penny: Don’t look at me like that, I tried."
"10","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"10","Ramona: Hey, did you eat yet?"
"10","Sheldon: Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating."
"10","Ramona: Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches."
"10","Sheldon: How thoughtful. Thank you."
"10","Ramona: Mmm. No big deal, I enjoy spending time with you."
"10","Sheldon: And I with you. Question, are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?"
"10","Ramona: What if I were?"
"10","Sheldon: Well, that would raise a number of problems. We’re colleagues. I’m currently in a relation… Excuse me a moment."
"10","Scene: Princeton."
"10","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Will you marry me?"
"10","(Knock, knock, knock)"
