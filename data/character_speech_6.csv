"6","Sheldon: Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?"
"6","Leonard: Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song."
"6","Sheldon: It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell."
"6","Howard and Raj (together): Turtle power!"
"6","Sheldon: However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can."
"6","Howard: Yeah, so?"
"6","Sheldon: I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider."
"6","Raj: an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies."
"6","Howard: It’s heebie-jeebies."
"6","Raj: I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises."
"6","Leonard: Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1."
"6","Raj: Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it."
"6","Leonard: Penny’s working tonight, I’m in."
"6","Howard: Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents."
"6","Leonard: Fun. We know how much you love that."
"6","Howard: It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common."
"6","Sheldon: You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders."
"6","Howard: Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law."
"6","Sheldon: No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China."
"6","Howard: Great, thank you."
"6","Sheldon: Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry."
"6","Raj: What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?"
"6","Sheldon: Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China."
"6","Leonard: That should lighten the mood."
"6","Sheldon: What can I say? I put the fun in funeral."
"6","Credits sequence."
"6","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"6","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Oh, right, funeral. (Knock, knock, knock) (solemnly) Amy."
"6","Amy: Hello, Sheldon."
"6","Sheldon: I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?"
"6","Amy: I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral."
"6","Sheldon: You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya."
"6","Amy: Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?"
"6","Sheldon: Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor."
"6","Amy: But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny."
"6","Amy: Never mind. Good night, Sheldon."
"6","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being."
"6","Amy: Thank you, Sheldon."
"6","Sheldon: You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with."
"6","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"6","Howard: So, how have you been?"
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine."
"6","Howard: Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?"
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: It’s fine."
"6","Howard: I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?"
"6","Bernadette: I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while."
"6","Howard: I like rare chicken. Let’s do this."
"6","Bernadette: You could die."
"6","Howard: Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go."
"6","Mrs. Rostenkowski: Here’s another beer, honey."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Thank you."
"6","Howard: So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?"
"6","Mrs. Rostenkowski: It was good."
"6","Howard: Had no idea you were the chatty one."
"6","Sheldon: 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better."
"6","Amy: Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour."
"6","Sheldon: Well, not with that attitude."
"6","Amy: I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking."
"6","Sheldon: I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?"
"6","Amy: Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity."
"6","Sheldon: Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."
"6","Amy: Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest."
"6","Sheldon: How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest."
"6","Amy: You, you want to rub something on my chest?"
"6","Sheldon: Yes. All over it."
"6","Amy: Maybe we should start with that."
"6","Sheldon: Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling."
"6","Amy: Oh, I’m counting on it."
"6","Howard: Okay, dig in."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen."
"6","Howard: Took the words right out of my mouth."
"6","Bernadette: So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?"
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: I’m going next weekend."
"6","Howard: Oh, you like to fish?"
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Yes."
"6","Howard: Sure. I can hear it in your voice."
"6","Mrs. Rostenkowski: Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go."
"6","Howard: You know, I hadn’t thought of that. (To Bernadette, whispering) Help me."
"6","Bernadette: Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better."
"6","Howard: No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night."
"6","Bernadette: Howie, I think you’d have fun."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine, you can tag along."
"6","Bernadette: Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’."
"6","Howard: Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing."
"6","Bernadette: What thing?"
"6","Howard: You know, the thing."
"6","Bernadette: Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, it’s settled. You and I are going fishing."
"6","Howard: Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help."
"6","Scene: The stairwell."
"6","Howard: I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster."
"6","Raj: If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here."
"6","Leonard: Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers."
"6","Howard: Do either of you guys know how to fish?"
"6","Leonard: No."
"6","Raj: No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves."
"6","Howard: Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this."
"6","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"6","Penny: S’up?"
"6","Penny: Step one, worms."
"6","Howard: Ew!"
"6","Penny: Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up."
"6","Howard: Really?"
"6","Penny: You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing."
"6","Howard: Okay."
"6","Penny: What are you waiting for?"
"6","Howard: I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes."
"6","Penny: Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook."
"6","Howard: Fine. There."
"6","Leonard: I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm."
"6","Howard: Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm."
"6","Penny: Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face."
"6","Raj: You got this, buddy."
"6","Leonard: Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm."
"6","Raj: You can do it."
"6","Penny: That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up."
"6","Sheldon (reading): And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end."
"6","Amy: That was great. Rub my chest again. (Knock at door)"
"6","Sheldon: No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. (Opens door)"
"6","Bernadette: How’s the poor thing?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking."
"6","Bernadette: Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts."
"6","Sheldon: Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?"
"6","Amy: I don’t have a bath thermometer."
"6","Sheldon: Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature."
"6","Bernadette: This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music."
"6","Amy: Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick."
"6","Bernadette: I don’t understand."
"6","Amy: I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me."
"6","Bernadette: So you’ve just been lying to him?"
"6","Amy: See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement."
"6","Bernadette: I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do."
"6","Amy: All right. I’ll tell him."
"6","Sheldon (off): Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?"
"6","Amy: I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath."
"6","Penny: Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?"
"6","Howard: No, I’m fine. Keep going."
"6","Penny: All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?"
"6","Leonard: It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us."
"6","Penny: What, never?"
"6","Leonard: My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid."
"6","Raj: Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating."
"6","Howard: Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday."
"6","Raj: Yeah, okay, Howard wins."
"6","Leonard: You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip."
"6","Howard: You’re right. Oh! I should do this."
"6","Penny: Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull."
"6","Howard: Here we go. Oh!"
"6","Penny: Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. (All the guys gag)"
"6","Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is dancing to “Walking on Sunshine”. Hears door and turns off stereo."
"6","Amy: Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath."
"6","Sheldon: I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab."
"6","Amy: Oh?"
"6","Sheldon: I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire."
"6","Amy: All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me."
"6","Sheldon: It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour."
"6","Amy: I feel terrible I did this."
"6","Sheldon: It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."
"6","Amy: I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?"
"6","Sheldon: In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit."
"6","Amy: I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey."
"6","Amy: Are you saying you want to spank me?"
"6","Sheldon: I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice."
"6","Amy: That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl."
"6","Scene: Bernadette’s parents’ garage."
"6","Howard: Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s what you’re wearing?"
"6","Howard: No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Maybe in cartoons."
"6","Howard: Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning."
"6","Howard: Wait, now we’re shooting things?"
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up."
"6","Howard: Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: So, why’d you agree to come?"
"6","Howard: ‘Cause Bernadette made me."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go."
"6","Howard: Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she’s only four feet tall."
"6","Howard: So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?"
"6","Howard: No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play."
"6","Howard: Really? Thank you, sir."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: Call me Mike."
"6","Howard: Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?"
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about."
"6","Howard: Great couple of gals."
"6","Mr. Rostenkowski: I wouldn’t go that far."
"6","Sheldon: Are you prepared to receive your punishment?"
"6","Amy: One second. I want to put on some music."
"6","Sheldon: Why?"
"6","Amy: I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me."
"6","Sheldon: Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin."
"6","Amy: Oh, my."
"6","Sheldon: Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this."
"6","Amy: Then maybe you should spank me harder."
"6","Sheldon: Maybe I will."
"6","Amy: Ooh!"
"6","Series 06 Episode 11 – The Santa Simulation"
"6","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"6","Penny: Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs."
"6","Leonard: Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands."
"6","Penny: You’re so butch."
"6","Leonard: Aw, I got a little paper cut."
"6","Penny: Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal."
"6","Leonard: Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys."
"6","Penny: Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?"
"6","Leonard: Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore."
"6","Penny: Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?"
"6","Leonard: Little bit, yeah."
"6","Scene: The apartment."
"6","Amy: Oh, great! I’ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, oh, I’m sorry. I should’ve mentioned this earlier. You’re not invited."
"6","Amy: Why not?"
"6","Sheldon: Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves."
"6","Amy: By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?"
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, like a bunch of savages."
"6","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Bernadette is on the webcam."
"6","Bernadette: Saturday night? But I’ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night."
"6","Howard: But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage."
"6","Bernadette: You’re an idiot."
"6","Howard: I’m your idiot. Forever."
"6","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"6","Raj: So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place."
"6","Stuart: Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!"
"6","Credits sequence."
"6","Leonard: All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you."
"6","Sheldon: A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas."
"6","Stuart: What’s wrong with Christmas?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?"
"6","Howard:Pirate with a peg leg?"
"6","Sheldon: Actually that helps, thank you."
"6","Leonard: Would you just look inside?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no."
"6","Leonard: It’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. Thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme."
"6","Sheldon: Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly."
"6","Leonard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place."
"6","Raj: Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass."
"6","Stuart: Do you hear yourself when you say these things?"
"6","Leonard: Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?"
"6","Sheldon: I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy."
"6","Leonard: Fine. Howard, what do you do?"
"6","Howard: I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way."
"6","Leonard: And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor."
"6","Howard: Okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front."
"6","Raj: No, screw that noise, I’m going in. Hang on, Santa, I’m coming for you."
"6","Leonard: Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game."
"6","Raj: But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?"
"6","Sheldon: Lucky."
"6","Leonard: Okay, come on, moving on."
"6","Raj: Wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me."
"6","Stuart: Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud."
"6","Penny (entering): Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty."
"6","(entering)"
"6","Sheldon: I know they’re making a rhetorical point, I just don’t know what it is."
"6","Penny: See you, boys. We are going drinking."
"6","Raj: Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died."
"6","Bernadette: Sorry, Raj, it’s girls’ night out."
"6","Amy: Maybe another time."
"6","Leonard: Okay…"
"6","Penny: Come on."
"6","Raj: Ooh! Girls’ night, girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!"
"6","Stuart: How does he not hear that?"
"6","Scene: A bar."
"6","Amy: So, what’s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?"
"6","Bernadette: No!"
"6","Penny: No!"
"6","Amy: Geez, who’s Forever 63 now?"
"6","Raj: Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat."
"6","Amy: Thanks."
"6","Penny: Wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. And not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of Pabst."
"6","Raj: My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout."
"6","Bernadette: Hey, let’s help Raj meet a girl tonight."
"6","Raj: No, no, no, I’m fine."
"6","Penny: Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?"
"6","Amy: Let’s get him laid!"
"6","Raj: Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night."
"6","Penny: Raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you."
"6","Bernadette: Yeah, you’re a real catch. I know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life."
"6","Raj: That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?"
"6","Bernadette: We’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you."
"6","Raj: Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens."
"6","Penny: Nines or tens?"
"6","Raj: Okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub."
"6","Bernadette: Bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?"
"6","Raj: In a New Delhi minute."
"6","Stuart: I don’t remember you buying these miniatures in my store."
"6","Leonard: Oh, uh, yeah. I got ’em on Amazon."
"6","Stuart: Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?"
"6","Leonard: I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet."
"6","Stuart: Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet."
"6","Howard: Can we please move this along?"
"6","Leonard: Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest."
"6","Howard: Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile."
"6","Leonard: Great. What do you do?"
"6","Howard: I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”"
"6","Sheldon: I open the chest."
"6","Leonard: It’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in."
"6","Stuart: That’s not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia."
"6","Leonard: Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory."
"6","Howard: Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?"
"6","Leonard: Walls are getting closer."
"6","Stuart: Oh, boy, happy place, happy place."
"6","Sheldon: Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia."
"6","Leonard: You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight."
"6","Howard: What are we supposed to do?"
"6","Leonard: Seven, six."
"6","Sheldon: Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol."
"6","Howard: Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy."
"6","Leonard: Three, two."
"6","Stuart: Somebody sing the damn song."
"6","Sheldon: Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even"
"6","Leonard: The walls are getting slower."
"6","Sheldon: Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel."
"6","Leonard:The walls stop. You’re safe."
"6","Howard: That was amazing, Sheldon."
"6","Stuart: How did you know that?"
"6","Sheldon: It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos."
"6","Leonard: Okay, continuing our quest."
"6","Sheldon: W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…"
"6","Scene: The bar."
"6","Bernadette: Looks like he’s doing pretty good."
"6","Penny: Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean."
"6","Amy: That is some low-hanging fruit."
"6","Bernadette: Oh, here he comes."
"6","Penny: So, how’d it go?"
"6","Raj: Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address."
"6","Penny: Ooh!"
"6","Bernadette: Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser."
"6","Raj: What?"
"6","Bernadette: I’m sorry, Raj."
"6","Raj: Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart, I’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t."
"6","Penny: Oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them."
"6","Raj: No, it’s not. She was too beautiful for me."
"6","Bernadette: Why would you say that?"
"6","Raj: It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you."
"6","Amy: The two of them? I don’t understand."
"6","Raj: Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals."
"6","Amy: And you liked Bernadette also?"
"6","Raj: That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way."
"6","Amy: So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too."
"6","Raj: No, not really."
"6","Penny: Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?"
"6","Raj: Not that I can think of."
"6","Bernadette: Think harder."
"6","Raj: Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn’t, I mean, at all. What?"
"6","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is still singing."
"6","Sheldon: Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum."
"6","Howard: Done?"
"6","Sheldon: I think the word you’re looking for is bravo."
"6","Leonard: Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen."
"6","Sheldon: Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?"
"6","Leonard: I don’t know. What’s the difference?"
"6","Sheldon: Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture."
"6","Leonard: Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water."
"6","Sheldon: What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?"
"6","Leonard: You see those, too."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, it’s like I’m really there."
"6","Stuart: I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I’ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool."
"6","Howard: Good story."
"6","Leonard: What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?"
"6","Sheldon: Yes. What, is there a problem?"
"6","Leonard: No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy."
"6","Sheldon: Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside."
"6","Leonard: Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?"
"6","Leonard: Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now."
"6","Stuart: What was so bad about them?"
"6","Leonard: I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded."
"6","Sheldon: No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing."
"6","Leonard: It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift."
"6","Raj: Amy, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you."
"6","Amy: It’s fine. I’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn’t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I’d give him back his insulin."
"6","Bernadette: Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants."
"6","Amy: Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand."
"6","Raj: I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me."
"6","Amy: You think that’s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on."
"6","Raj: Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person."
"6","Amy: I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it."
"6","Raj: It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone."
"6","Amy: It is, isn’t it?"
"6","Raj: But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon."
"6","Amy: I do. And don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too."
"6","Raj: Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are."
"6","Amy: Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I’m good. We can go now."
"6","Raj: Damn it."
"6","Penny: What?"
"6","Raj: Now that I know she doesn’t like me, I’m kind of into her."
"6","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is writing numbers on a whiteboard."
"6","Sheldon: All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge."
"6","Howard: Great. Let’s do it. (They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells)"
"6","(They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells)"
"6","Leonard: The drawbridge is lowering."
"6","Stuart: My carpal tunnel’s acting up."
"6","Sheldon: Play through the pain."
"6","Leonard: You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me."
"6","Howard: Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that."
"6","Stuart: I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him."
"6","Sheldon: But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard."
"6","Howard: Wait, what are you doing?"
"6","Sheldon: You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?"
"6","Leonard: Uh, okay."
"6","Sheldon: My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back."
"6","Leonard: This is weird, right?"
"6","Sheldon: Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!"
"6","Leonard: Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend."
"6","Scene: The apartment, late at night."
"6","Sheldon: Santa?"
"6","Santa: Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep."
"6","Sheldon: Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots."
"6","Santa: Oh. I’ve been wanting to talk to you. I’m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn’t one of them."
"6","Sheldon: I understand."
"6","Santa: But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, I hope it’s a train."
"6","Santa: Oh, it’s better than a train."
"6","Sheldon: Two trains?"
"6","Santa: Better."
"6","Sheldon: I’m getting three trains."
"6","Santa: Okay, open ’em. (It’s a cannon, pointed at Sheldon) This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!"
"6","(It’s a cannon, pointed at Sheldon)"
"6","Sheldon: Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense…"
"6","Santa: Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork. (Fires cannon)"

"6","Penny: No."
"6","Sheldon: Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come later."
"6","Penny: Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can’t afford another demerit."
"6","Leonard: Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately."
"6","Sheldon: Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?"
"6","Leonard: I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere."
"6","Sheldon: I’m deleting it."
"6","Penny: Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it yet."
"6","Leonard: You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas."
"6","Sheldon: No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts."
"6","Leonard: There is no season three. They cancelled that show."
"6","Sheldon: Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger."
"6","Leonard: They did."
"6","Penny: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?"
"6","Sheldon: Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?"
"6","Penny: As a rule, no."
"6","Sheldon: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what happened."
"6","Penny: Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for."
"6","Leonard: Oh, please, don’t do that."
"6","Sheldon: No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended."
"6","Penny: I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call."
"6","Leonard: Ah, don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel."

"6","Raj: Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work, right?"
"6","Howard: Why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software."
"6","Raj: Wait, hold on. This is weird."
"6","Howard: What?"
"6","Raj: I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating, and I found her blog."
"6","Howard: Cool. Anything juicy?"
"6","Raj: She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist, too?"
"6","Howard: You know what’s going on, don’t you?"
"6","Raj: Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils."
"6","Howard: I can’t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj."
"6","Raj: Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin."
"6","Howard: Keep reading. What does it say?"
"6","Raj: No, no, I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary."
"6","Howard: It’s exactly what it’s like. Keep reading."
"6","Raj: No, this is creepy."
"6","Howard: Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera."
"6","Raj: It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh, look who’s got the sweetest kisses."
"6","Howard: Should I go?"
"6","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"6","Leonard: With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?"
"6","Penny: It’s six thirty in the morning."
"6","Leonard: I thought you grew up on a farm."
"6","Sheldon (on phone): Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and I don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?"
"6","(on phone)"
"6","Amy: I’m sorry you’re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this."
"6","Sheldon: I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug."
"6","Amy: Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end."
"6","Amy: You know, I might be able to help you with this. There’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, but I just told you, I don’t have a problem with closure."
"6","Amy: You sure about that?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing."
"6","(Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.)"
"6","Scene: Raj’s office."
"6","Howard: Ready to go to lunch?"
"6","Raj: Do you think I’m feminine?"
"6","Howard: Yeah. Let’s go."
"6","Raj: Thanks a lot."
"6","Howard: What’s going on?"
"6","Raj: I broke down, and I read Lucy’s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine."
"6","Howard: Just a little? That’s great."
"6","Raj: I have to talk to her about this."
"6","Howard: Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game."
"6","Raj: Well, that doesn’t seem fair."
"6","Howard: Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?"
"6","Raj: No, it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair."
"6","Howard: So take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off."
"6","Raj: Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?"
"6","Howard: The key to her heart. That’s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?"
"6","Raj: I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John."
"6","Leonard: So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it."
"6","Penny: It was cute."
"6","Leonard: Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst."
"6","Penny: What’s wrong with cute?"
"6","Leonard: It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them."
"6","Penny: So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?"
"6","Leonard: You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it."
"6","Penny: I liked it. I’m excited."
"6","Leonard: Well, then, tell your face."
"6","Penny: What do you want from me?"
"6","Leonard: You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on."
"6","Penny: Oh, come on, don’t be like that."
"6","Leonard: Well…"
"6","Penny: I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one."
"6","Leonard: Really?"
"6","Penny: Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth."
"6","Leonard: All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse."
"6","Penny: Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs."
"6","Amy: I’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure."
"6","Sheldon: I take issue with the word compulsive."
"6","Amy: All I’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…"
"6","Sheldon: …tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let’s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?"
"6","Amy: I’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming."
"6","Sheldon: By playing tic-tac-toe?"
"6","Amy: Yep. Your turn."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn’t finish."
"6","(She wipes the board clean.)"
"6","Amy: Exactly. How does that make you feel?"
"6","Sheldon: The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti."
"6","Amy: And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment."

"6","Amy: Come on, you can do this."
"6","Sheldon: You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release."
"6","Amy: Yeah, sounds like a drag."
"6","Penny: Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?"
"6","Bernadette: Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?"
"6","Penny: Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it."
"6","Bernadette: Why does this bother you so much?"
"6","Penny: I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?"
"6","Bernadette: Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god."
"6","Penny: See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys."
"6","Bernadette: Well, there’s no reason you can’t."
"6","Penny: You think?"
"6","Bernadette: Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about."
"6","Penny: Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work."

"6","Howard: However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it."
"6","Raj: Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey."
"6","Howard: I don’t know. Go with hockey."
"6","Raj: Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that’s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey."
"6","Lucy: Hi."
"6","Raj: Come in."

"6","Raj: Thanks. I love hockey."
"6","Lucy: Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who’s your favourite player?"
"6","Raj: Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?"
"6","Lucy: It’s still a little frozen in the middle."
"6","Raj: Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z."
"6","Lucy: Is something going on?"
"6","Raj: What do you mean?"
"6","Lucy: Well, you’re acting all weird, and I’m pretty weird, so I think I know what I’m talking about."
"6","Raj: I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking."
"6","Lucy: I think I’m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks."
"6","Raj: Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me."
"6","Lucy: Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn’t think anybody actually read it."
"6","Raj: No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine."
"6","Lucy: Why were you acting so strange tonight?"
"6","Raj: You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly."
"6","Lucy: Raj, I didn’t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you’re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face."
"6","Raj: I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen."
"6","Lucy: So, are you okay?"
"6","Raj: Yeah."
"6","Lucy: Good. Do you even like hockey?"
"6","Raj: No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift."
"6","Penny: So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy."
"6","Leonard: The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand."
"6","Penny: See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you."
"6","Leonard: Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again."
"6","Penny: No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about."
"6","Leonard: Those things can still happen."
"6","Penny: Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now."
"6","Leonard: That’s a big deal."
"6","Penny: It is, isn’t it?"
"6","Leonard: So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?"
"6","Penny: Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke."
"6","Sheldon: Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening."
"6","Amy: I’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive."
"6","Sheldon: Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…"
"6","Amy: And?"
"6","Sheldon: Doesn’t matter, does it?"

"6","Sheldon: Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye."

"6","Penny: Got it."
"6","Sheldon: Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!"
"6","Leonard: Nice shot."
"6","Penny: Eh, his giant head did most of the work."
"6","Sheldon: Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton."
"6","Leonard: You’re kidding. He’s still alive?"
"6","Sheldon: Yes."
"6","Penny: Who’s Professor Proton?"
"6","Leonard: He was the host of this great… Hey!"
"6","Penny: Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton."
"6","Sheldon: Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects."
"6","Leonard: It was pretty cool."
"6","Penny: Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him."
"6","Leonard: Hire him to do what?"
"6","Sheldon: Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar."
"6","Leonard: It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?"
"6","Sheldon: Well, I’m e-mailing him right now."

"6","Raj: Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?"
"6","Howard: Why don’t you put her in a kennel?"
"6","Raj: Why don’t you put your mother in a home?"
"6","Howard: To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine."
"6","Raj: Thank you."
"6","Sheldon: It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house."
"6","Leonard: You’re kidding."
"6","Howard: You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?"
"6","Sheldon: And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that."
"6","Howard: How’d you get him to come to your house?"
"6","Sheldon: As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin."
"6","Leonard: And he wrote him a cheque."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, that, too. Big cheque."
"6","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"6","Raj: Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party."
"6","Howard: You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?"
"6","Raj: And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num."
"6","Howard: Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?"
"6","Raj: It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like."
"6","Howard: Classy dog."

"6","Sheldon (off): Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?"
"6","Leonard: Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night."
"6","Sheldon (off): I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo."
"6","Leonard: That’s not ridiculous. Good night."
"6","Sheldon (off): Do you have cufflinks?"
"6","Leonard: No."
"6","Sheldon (off): Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?"
"6","Leonard: Okay, good night."
"6","Sheldon (off): Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?"
"6","Leonard: What?"
"6","Sheldon (off): I still can’t sleep."
"6","Howard: She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?"
"6","Bernadette: Yeah, you two were so cute playing together."
"6","Howard: It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me."
"6","Bernadette: And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs."
"6","Howard: Yeah, that’s what I was doing."
"6","Bernadette: You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family."
"6","Howard: Really?"
"6","Bernadette: Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it."
"6","Howard: Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone."
"6","Bernadette: Where’d she go?"
"6","Howard: I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note."
"6","Bernadette: Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller."
"6","Howard: No, I wasn’t. You were."
"6","Bernadette: No, I wasn’t."
"6","Howard: Yes, you were!."
"6","Bernadette: Yeah, well, you throw like a girl."
"6","Sheldon: I’m getting worried."
"6","Penny: Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late."
"6","Sheldon: Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye."
"6","(Phone rings)"
"6","Leonard: Where is he?"
"6","Sheldon: The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you."
"6","(On the third floor landing)"
"6","Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator."
"6","Arthur: I agree."
"6","Sheldon: Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you."
"6","Arthur: Just, just call me Arthur."
"6","Sheldon: Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends."
"6","Arthur: No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator."
"6","Sheldon: Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes."
"6","Arthur: Is, uh, is he dangerous?"
"6","Leonard: Actually, he’s a genius."
"6","Sheldon: I am."
"6","Arthur: That doesn’t answer my question."
"6","Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny."
"6","Arthur: Hi."
"6","Penny: Hello."
"6","Arthur: Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur."
"6","Arthur: Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?"
"6","Leonard: Yes, sir."
"6","Arthur: You’re the genius."
"6","(Back in the Apartment)"
"6","Penny: So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?"
"6","Arthur: It, it’s hard to say. I’m, I’m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is."
"6","Leonard: We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life."
"6","Arthur: Well, there, there really isn’t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children’s parties to, to make a living."
"6","Leonard: That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding."
"6","Arthur: You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?"
"6","Sheldon: Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing."
"6","Arthur: You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?"
"6","Arthur: No, no. I, I hate that puppet."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!"
"6","Arthur: I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?"
"6","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"6","Bernadette: Cinnamon!"
"6","Howard: Cinnamon!"
"6","Bernadette: You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent."
"6","Howard: Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy."
"6","(In a bad Indian accent)"
"6","Bernadette (likewise): Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?"
"6","(likewise)"
"6","Howard: Nice."
"6","Bernadette: Thanks."
"6","Howard: When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on."
"6","Bernadette: It turns you on when I sound like Raj?"
"6","Arthur: Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?"
"6","Penny: I think I know."
"6","Sheldon: It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in."
"6","Penny: Okay, I didn’t know."
"6","Penny: See, I’m not a scientist like them."
"6","Arthur: I, I figured that out."
"6","Sheldon: Potato clock. Do potato clock."
"6","Penny: What’s that?"
"6","Arthur: I, I power a clock with a, with a potato."
"6","Penny: Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?"
"6","Arthur: No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done."
"6","Sheldon: What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away."
"6","Arthur: No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long."
"6","Leonard: Then what is it?"
"6","Arthur: I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more."
"6","Sheldon: Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best."
"6","Arthur: What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife."
"6","Sheldon: Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446"
"6","Penny: I’m sorry to hear about your troubles."
"6","Arthur: Uh, thanks."
"6","Penny: But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?"
"6","Arthur: What do you two talk about?"
"6","Sheldon: I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?"
"6","Arthur: I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it."
"6","Sheldon: Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up."
"6","Arthur: No, I, I get that."
"6","Sheldon: But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon."
"6","Leonard: I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders."
"6","Arthur: Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot."
"6","Leonard: It’s important you know how much you mean to us."
"6","Arthur: Uh-oh."
"6","Penny: Arthur, are you okay?"
"6","Arthur: I’m having a problem with my pacemaker."
"6","Leonard: I’ll, I’ll call for help."
"6","Penny: Any chance we could plug it into the potato?"
"6","Arthur: No."
"6","Scene: The telescope lab. Raj’s phone rings."
"6","Raj: Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner."
"6","Paramedic: Your vitals are stable, but let’s take you in for some tests just to be safe."
"6","Leonard: You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?"
"6","Sheldon: I’ll do it."
"6","Arthur: He’s not a relative, he’s not allowed, right?"
"6","Paramedic: No, that’s not a rule. He can go."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, yeah."
"6","Arthur: I can’t catch a break today."
"6","Penny: We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital."
"6","Leonard: I’m sorry things turned out this way."
"6","Arthur: Well, at, at this point, I’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs."
"6","Sheldon: Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever."
"6","Bernadette: Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom."
"6","Howard: Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?"
"6","Bernadette: It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?"
"6","Howard: It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk."
"6","(Skype tone) I"
"6","Raj: Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?"
"6","Howard: What?"
"6","Raj: A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar."
"6","Howard: You have her?"
"6","Bernadette: Oh, thank God she’s okay."
"6","Raj: Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours."
"6","Howard: I’m really sorry."
"6","Bernadette: Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?"
"6","Raj: Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry."
"6","Bernadette: So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?"
"6","Raj: Well, I, I thought about…"
"6","Bernadette: Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself."
"6","Raj: Sorry. I, I just…"
"6","Bernadette: Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done."
"6","Howard: Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom."
"6","Scene: A hospital room."
"6","Sheldon: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
"6","Arthur: Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice."
"6","Sheldon: Want me to sing it again?"
"6","Arthur: No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm."
"6","Sheldon: There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?"
"6","Arthur: No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask."
"6","Sheldon: Name it."
"6","Arthur: Well, I’m, I’m booked to do a children’s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don’t feel up to it."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, you’re not. You look awful."
"6","Arthur: Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you’d fill in for me."
"6","Sheldon: Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?"
"6","Arthur: Yeah."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods."
"6","Arthur: Or a Korean family in Alhambra."
"6","Sheldon: But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?"
"6","Arthur: Sounds great."
"6","Sheldon: So, in a way it’s like I’m your son."
"6","Arthur: What, Whatever."
"6","Sheldon: Father."
"6","Arthur: Sure, what the hell."

I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me."
"6","Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, (Nicolas Cage voice) Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero."
"6","(Nicolas Cage voice)"
"6","Leonard: See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am."
"6","Sheldon: As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes."
"6","Raj: Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. (Text sound) Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya."
"6","(Text sound)"
"6","Leonard: Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started."
"6","Raj: You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye."
"6","Howard: We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says, (Raj voice) don’t worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest. (Nicolas Cage voice) Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend."
"6","(Raj voice)"
"6","Sheldon: Go on, give him your lunch money."
"6","Scene: A restaurant"
"6","Raj: I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight."
"6","Lucy: Me, too."
"6","Raj: Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet."
"6","Lucy: Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body."
"6","Raj: Really?"
"6","Lucy: Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you’ll know why."
"6","Raj: I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that."
"6","Lucy: Oh, it’s okay. I’ve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared."
"6","Raj: What else have you been thinking about doing?"
"6","Lucy: Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs."
"6","Raj: I like your bangs."
"6","Lucy: Oh, thanks, I like ’em, too."
"6","Raj: What else?"
"6","Lucy: Mmm, it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door."
"6","Raj: Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies."
"6","Lucy: I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53"
"6","Leonard: I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way."
"6","Howard: Uh, it does. (Creaking sound)"
"6","(Creaking sound)"
"6","Sheldon: He does sound effects, too!"
"6","Leonard: Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. (Clicking sounds) Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. (Strange howl)"
"6","(Clicking sounds)"
"6","(Strange howl)"
"6","Sheldon: Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. (Blows raspberry)"
"6","(Blows raspberry)"
"6","Penny: Guess who?"
"6","Howard: What are you doing back?"
"6","Bernadette: That’s an excellent question. Amy?"
"6","Amy: Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow."
"6","Bernadette: Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone."
"6","Amy: I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot."
"6","Penny: Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it."
"6","Amy: You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend."
"6","Sheldon: Ah, that’s my girl."
"6","Leonard: No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun."
"6","Sheldon: It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?"
"6","Leonard: What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players."
"6","Sheldon: Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before."
"6","Penny: Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has."
"6","Leonard: So, what do you say?"
"6","Sheldon: I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master."
"6","Howard: A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, (Al Pacino voice) You’re playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D."
"6","(Al Pacino voice)"
"6","Scene: Later, the same."
"6","Penny: Okay, who wants a drink?"
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment."
"6","Penny: Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you."
"6","Leonard: Double potion, please."
"6","Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!"
"6","Sheldon: Okay, literal goose bumps. Look."
"6","Howard: What do you do?"
"6","Leonard: I draw my broadsword."
"6","Sheldon: I ready my quarter-staff."
"6","Penny: I drink my potion."
"6","Bernadette: I say we attack the big one."
"6","Penny: You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll."
"6","Howard: The dungeon master’s supposed to roll."
"6","Penny: Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?"
"6","Howard: Uh, fifteen or higher."
"6","Penny: Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points."
"6","Penny: More potion, please."
"6","Leonard: Yeah."
"6","Scene: The restaurant."
"6","Raj: How are your crab cakes?"
"6","Lucy: Kind of funky."
"6","Raj: That’s great."
"6","Lucy: It is? Does funky mean something different in India?"
"6","Raj: No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance."
"6","Lucy: Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ’em."
"6","Raj: Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?"
"6","Waiter: Everything all right?"
"6","Lucy: Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?"
"6","Waiter: Yes."
"6","Lucy: ‘Kay, thanks, bye."
"6","Raj: Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?"
"6","Lucy: N-No, it, it’s fine. Uh, He’s from a different country, he doesn’t understand our ways."
"6","Raj: Don’t be silly. Just tell him."
"6","Lucy: I have to go to the bathroom. And it’s not because the crab cakes are funky."
"6","Waiter: So you’re okay here?"
"6","Raj: Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me."
"6","Scene: Lucy climbs out of bathroom window to find a locked gate."
"6","Lucy: Uh-oh. (Dials phone) Hey, Raj. Funny story."
"6","(Dials phone)"
"6","Bernadette: Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres."
"6","Howard: Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined."
"6","Sheldon: That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre."
"6","Leonard: All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out."
"6","Amy: Okay."
"6","Penny: Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on."
"6","Amy: Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas."
"6","Penny: No, it’s not."
"6","Scene: An alley behind the restaurant."
"6","Raj: Lucy?"
"6","Lucy: Hey. Long time no see."
"6","Raj: You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity."
"6","Lucy: I’m sorry."
"6","Raj: Why would you leave like that?"
"6","Lucy: You were pushing me. I clearly didn’t want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway."
"6","Raj: Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?"
"6","Lucy: Well, how can I tell you I’m upset if I can’t tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature? It’s scary."
"6","Raj: Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk."
"6","Lucy: How could you like me a lot?"
"6","Raj: Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful."
"6","Lucy: I’m sweating out of my head."
"6","Howard: The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano."
"6","Sheldon: Yay!"
"6","Howard: But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?"
"6","Howard: Fine. (Christopher Walken voice) You’d think, after all these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking idiot."
"6","(Christopher Walken voice)"
"6","Sheldon: The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect."
"6","Leonard: All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off."
"6","Amy: Here we go. Fifteen?"
"6","Howard: It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground."
"6","Sheldon: Wait. Wait. And says?"
"6","Howard: Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight."
"6","Bernadette: This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master."
"6","Howard: Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure."
"6","Sheldon: Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in."
"6","Amy: Sheldon, they’re talking about sex."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, then I’m out."
"6","Penny: Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?"
"6","Bernadette: Ooh! Come on, back me up here."
"6","Howard: Oh."
"6","Together: Ooh!"
"6","Bernadette: Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy."
"6","Leonard: Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that."
"6","Howard: The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do you do?"
"6","Amy: I don’t like this."
"6","Sheldon: You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?"
"6","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"6","Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy."
"6","(off)"
"6","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"6","Amy: What?"
"6","Sheldon: I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride."
"6","Amy: You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up."
"6","Sheldon: Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise."
"6","Amy: I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke."
"6","Sheldon: Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face."
"6","Amy: Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone."
"6","Amy: And now?"
"6","Sheldon: And now what?"
"6","Amy: Do you have any interest now?"
"6","Sheldon: I have not ruled it out."
"6","Amy: Wow. Talk dirty to me."
"6","Sheldon: I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate."
"6","Amy: I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more."
"6","Sheldon: More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years, here we are in bed together."
"6","Amy: Come on. Let’s go back out there."
"6","Sheldon: Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through."
"6","Sheldon: I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour. (Rolls dice) It comes off."
"6","(Rolls dice)"
"6","Amy: Oh."
"6","Sheldon: What do you do?"
"6","Amy: I kiss you on the lips."
"6","Sheldon: I kiss you back on the (Rolls dice) lips as well. Your turn."
"6","Amy: I remove your armour. What do you do?"
"6","Sheldon: I erotically caress your (Rolls dice) nose."
"6","Amy: Keep rolling."
"6","Scene: Outside Sheldon’s bedroom."
"6","Leonard: Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?"
"6","Sheldon (off): We’re fine, thank you."
"6","Penny: Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…"
"6","Amy: Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my (sound of dice) 14! Yes!"
"6","(sound of dice)"
"6","Series 06 Episode 24 – The Bon Voyage Reaction"
"6","Scene: The cafeteria."
"6","Raj: So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes."
"6","Leonard: Oh, that sounds romantic."
"6","Raj: It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time."
"6","Leonard: So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?"
"6","Raj: I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek."
"6","Leonard: How’s that been working for you?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt."
"6","Howard: Leonard, I may have gotten you a job."
"6","Leonard: I have a job."
"6","Sheldon: Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim."
"6","Howard: No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you."
"6","Leonard: Well, do you really think I have a shot?"
"6","Howard: Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen."
"6","Leonard: He knows, wow."
"6","Sheldon: Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?"
"6","Raj: Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity."
"6","Sheldon: No one asked you, Uhura."
"6","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"6","Sheldon: Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?"
"6","Leonard: What do you think?"
"6","Sheldon: Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?"
"6","Leonard: Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat."
"6","Sheldon: Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting."
"6","Leonard: I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone."
"6","Sheldon: I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning."
"6","Leonard: Sheldon."
"6","Sheldon: Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?"
"6","Leonard: Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me."
"6","Sheldon: Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?"
"6","Credits sequence."
"6","Scene: Raj’s apartment. Lucy is looking through Raj’s telescope."
"6","Raj: If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by."
"6","Lucy: Wow. Your friend was actually up there?"
"6","Raj: Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt"
"6","Lucy: Did he take the T-shirt to space?"
"6","Raj: Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"
"6","Lucy: I don’t know. How many are there?"
"6","Raj: Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra."
"6","Lucy: Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?"
"6","Raj: Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"
"6","Lucy: Will you be there?"
"6","Raj: Of course."
"6","Lucy: Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand."
"6","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"6","Penny: So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."
"6","Leonard: Oh, that’s awful."
"6","Penny: Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life."
"6","Leonard: So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?"
"6","Penny: I thought I said that to you."
"6","Leonard: Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them."
"6","Penny: Wow, Hawking. Good for you."
"6","Leonard: Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while."
"6","Penny: Well, how long?"
"6","Leonard: Three, four months."
"6","Penny: Whoa. When would you leave?"
"6","Leonard: Couple of weeks."
"6","Penny: Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you."
"6","Leonard: That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea."
"6","Penny: On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?"
"6","Leonard: Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory."
"6","Penny: Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months."
"6","Leonard: Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up."
"6","Penny: Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it."
"6","Leonard: Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning."
"6","Penny: Okay. Good."
"6","Leonard: I do have to ask you one favour."
"6","Penny: Sure."
"6","Leonard: Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone."
"6","Penny: Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?"
"6","Leonard: Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one."
"6","Scene: The apartment."
"6","Leonard: Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party."
"6","Howard: Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?"
"6","Amy: Hello, Rajesh."
"6","Howard (in Raj accent): Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It’s funnier with the accent."
"6","(in Raj accent)"
"6","Leonard: There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal."
"6","Sheldon: Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face."
"6","Penny: Sheldon, sweetie, shut up."
"6","Bernadette: You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left."
"6","Penny: Bernadette, sweetie, shut up."
"6","Raj: Okay. I have a request to make."
"6","Amy: And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there."
"6","Raj: The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy."
"6","Raj: Actually, I was thinking Leonard."
"6","Leonard: Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured."
"6","Howard: What the hell? I thought I was your best friend."
"6","Raj: You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger."
"6","Penny: You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first."
"6","Raj: Good idea. Bernadette?"
"6","Penny: What the hell?"
"6","Raj: Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman."
"6","Penny: Oh, yeah."
"6","Bernadette: Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?"
"6","Howard: Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary."
"6","Amy: It should be me."
"6","Raj: Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?"
"6","Amy: A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family."
"6","Sheldon: Fine, I’ll do it."
"6","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"6","Amy: So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me."
"6","Lucy: That’s really nice to hear."
"6","Amy: Maybe next week, we could all get together."
"6","Raj: Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her."
"6","Amy: Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety."
"6","Raj: What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!"
"6","Amy: Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!"
"6","Raj: Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot."
"6","Lucy: I think I have to go to the bathroom."
"6","Raj: We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon."
"6","Scene: A store."
"6","Sheldon: This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section."
"6","Penny: Yeah, it does, and here we are."
"6","Sheldon: You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this."
"6","Penny: Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him."
"6","Sheldon: Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches."
"6","Penny: Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out."
"6","Sheldon: It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions."
"6","Penny: Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard."
"6","Sheldon: I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me."
"6","Penny: Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job."
"6","Sheldon: It was you."
"6","Penny: It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…"
"6","Sheldon: You ripped out your own fake blonde hair."
"6","Penny: I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do."
"6","Sheldon: They lie so they don’t look petty."
"6","Penny: Yeah."
"6","Sheldon: How?"
"6","Penny: Like this. I am so happy for you."
"6","Sheldon: Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial."
"6","Raj (on skype): Hey."
"6","(on skype)"
"6","Lucy: Hi."
"6","Raj: I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?"
"6","Lucy: Amy wasn’t the problem."
"6","Raj: Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry."
"6","Lucy: Thank you."
"6","Raj: You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party."
"6","Lucy: A party?"
"6","Raj: A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there."
"6","Lucy: I’m not sure."
"6","Raj: Oh, please?"
"6","Lucy: Raj."
"6","Raj: Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it."
"6","Lucy: Okay."
"6","Raj: Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me."
"6","Bernadette: So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?"
"6","Leonard: Yeah."
"6","Bernadette: Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?"
"6","Howard: I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something."
"6","Leonard: I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime."
"6","Howard: Maybe your lifetime. I went to space."
"6","Leonard: It’s not a competition."
"6","Howard: You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water."
"6","Amy: Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming."
"6","Raj: She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?"
"6","Sheldon: Um, can I have your attention, everyone? (Clinks glass) That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him."
"6","(Clinks glass)"
"6","Leonard: Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say."
"6","Sheldon: Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers."
"6","Howard: Cheers."
"6","Penny: Cheers."
"6","Howard: It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard."
"6","Sheldon: Thank you."
"6","Howard: It must’ve killed you when I went to space."
"6","Raj (Looking at phone): Oh, no."
"6","(Looking at phone)"
"6","Howard: Buddy, you okay? Oh, man."
"6","Bernadette: What’s going on?"
"6","Raj: Uh, go ahead. Read it."
"6","Howard: Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy."
"6","Raj: Excuse me."
"6","Penny: Raj, I’m so sorry."
"6","Amy: Me, too."
"6","Sheldon: It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space."
"6","Scene: Penny’s car, outside the Airport."
"6","Penny: Well, here we are."
"6","Leonard: Yep. I’m really gonna miss you."
"6","Penny: I’m gonna miss you, too."
"6","Sheldon: Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law."
"6","Penny: Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…"
"6","Leonard: Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good."
"6","Sheldon: All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you."
"6","Leonard: Would you just relax?"
"6","Sheldon: Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport."
"6","Penny: Did you bring enough inhalers?"
"6","Penny: And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World."
"6","Leonard: I’m covered."
"6","Penny: Okay."
"6","Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made."
"6","Leonard: Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you."
"6","Penny: Oh, Leonard."
"6","Sheldon: It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move."
"6","Penny: I love you."
"6","Leonard: I love you, too."
"6","Sheldon: Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs."
"6","Penny: Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?"
"6","Raj: Hang on."
"6","Penny: Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing."
"6","Raj: That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in."
"6","Penny: Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?"
"6","Raj: No."
"6","Penny: Oh. I’m so sorry."
"6","Raj: No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away."
"6","Penny: Oh, Raj."
"6","Raj: Penny, I, I miss her already."
"6","Penny: I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too."
"6","Raj: What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?"
"6","Penny: You will."
"6","Raj: No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable."
"6","Penny: That’s just the booze talking."
"6","Raj: No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night."
"6","Penny: You’re talking to me."
"6","Raj: I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!"
"6","Penny: Oh, me, too."
"6","Raj: So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from."
"6","Penny: That’s great. Do you want some wine?"
"6","Raj: Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…"
"6","Amy: Does he ever shut up?"
"6","Raj: … but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining…."
