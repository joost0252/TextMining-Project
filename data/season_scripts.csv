1,"Series 01 Episode 01 – Pilot Episode// Scene: A corridor at a sperm bank.// Sheldon: So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.// Leonard: Agreed, what’s your point?// Sheldon: There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt.// Leonard: Excuse me?// Receptionist: Hang on.// Leonard: One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti.// Receptionist: Can I help you?// Leonard: Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?// Receptionist: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn’t be here.// Sheldon: I think this is the place.// Receptionist: Fill these out.// Leonard: Thank-you. We’ll be right back.// Receptionist: Oh, take your time. I’ll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.// (They sit and begin to fill in forms).// Sheldon: Leonard, I don’t think I can do this.// Leonard: What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro.// Sheldon: No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.// Leonard: Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.// Sheldon: I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.// Leonard: I’m sure she’ll still love him.// Sheldon: I wouldn’t.// Leonard: Well, what do you want to do?// Sheldon: I want to leave.// Leonard: Okay.// Sheldon: What’s the protocol for leaving?// Leonard: I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.// Sheldon: Let’s try just walking out.// Leonard: Okay. Receptionist: Bye.// Receptionist: Bye.// 
Receptionist: Bye.// Sheldon: Bye-bye// Leonard: See you.// Scene: The stairs of the apartment building.// Sheldon: Are you still mad about the sperm bank?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?// Leonard: Not really.// Sheldon: If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.// Leonard: I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.// Sheldon: No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.// Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?// Sheldon: No, that was the result of my work with lasers.// Leonard: New neighbour?// Sheldon: Evidently.// Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbour.// Sheldon: Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.// Penny: Oh, hi!// Leonard: Hi.// Sheldon: Hi.// Penny: Hi?// Leonard: We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.// Penny: Oh, that’s nice.// Leonard: Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.// Penny: Oh, okay, well, guess I’m your new neighbour, Penny.// Leonard: Leonard, Sheldon.// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.// Penny: Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.// Leonard: Oh, great.// Penny: Great.// Sheldon: Great.// Leonard: Great. Well, bye.// Penny: Bye.// Sheldon: Bye.// Leonard: Bye.// Leonard: Should we have invited her for lunch?// Sheldon: No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.// Leonard: We already watched the Season Two DVDs.// Sheldon: Not with commentary.// Leonard: I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.// Sheldon: We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.// Leonard: Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.// Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.// Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.// Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.// Leonard: I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat.// Sheldon: Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.// Leonard: Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.// Sheldon: To what end?// Leonard: Hi. Again.// Leonard: Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.// Sheldon: Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.// Penny: Oh, you’re inviting me over to eat?// Leonard: Uh, yes.// Penny: Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to.// Leonard: Great.// Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?// Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.// Leonard: Okay, well, make yourself at home.// Penny: Okay, thankyou.// Leonard: You’re very welcome.// Penny: This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?// Sheldon: Actually that’s my work.// Penny: Wow.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.// Penny: So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.// Sheldon: Yeah.// Penny: This is really impressive.// Leonard: I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.// Penny: Holy smokes.// Sheldon: If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”// Leonard: At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.// Sheldon: I didn’t invent them, they’re there.// Leonard: In what universe?// Sheldon: In all of them, that is the point.// Penny: Uh, do you guys mind if I start?// Sheldon: Um, Penny, that’s where I sit.// Penny: So, sit next to me.// Sheldon: No, I sit there.// Penny: What’s the difference?// Sheldon: What’s the difference?// Leonard: Here we go.// Sheldon: In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point.// Penny: Do you want me to move?// Sheldon: Well.// Leonard: Just sit somewhere else.// Sheldon: Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.)// Leonard: Sheldon, sit!// Sheldon: Aaah!// Leonard: Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.// Sheldon: That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.// Leonard: Yes I now, but…// Sheldon: Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.// Leonard: Yes, I remember.// Sheldon: I resent you saying we don’t have company.// Leonard: I’m sorry.// Sheldon: That is an antisocial implication.// Leonard: I said I’m sorry.// Penny: So, Klingon boggle?// Leonard: Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you.// Penny: Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.// Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.// Penny: Participate in the what?// Leonard: I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess.// Penny: Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.// Sheldon: That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.// Leonard: Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?// Penny: Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.// Sheldon: You’re lactose intolerant.// Leonard: I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea.// Penny: Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: So it’s based on your life?// Penny: No, I’m from Omaha.// Leonard: Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.// Penny: I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny.// Leonard: Well it sounds wonderful.// Penny: It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.// Sheldon (mouths): What’s happening.// Leonard (mouths back): I don’t know.// Penny: Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School.// Sheldon: It took you four years to get through High School?// Leonard: Don’t.// Penny: I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.// Leonard: Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.// Sheldon: You? No, you’ll only make it worse.// Penny: You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?// Sheldon: Yes.// Leonard: No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse.// Penny: Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work.// Leonard: Our shower works.// Penny: Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?// Sheldon: No?// Sheldon: No.// Leonard: It’s right down the hall.// Penny: Thanks. You guys are really sweet.// Sheldon: Well this is an interesting development.// Leonard: How so?// Sheldon: It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.// Leonard: That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode.// Sheldon: Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.// Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.// Sheldon: So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?// Sheldon: That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.// Leonard: Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.// Sheldon: Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed.// Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?// Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.// Leonard: I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour.// Sheldon: Oh, of course.// Leonard: That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.// Sheldon: Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?// Leonard: It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.// Howard: Wait till you see this.// Raj: It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.// Leonard: See what?// Howard: It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.// Leonard: This is not a good time.// Howard: It’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.// Leonard: That’s great, you guys have to go.// Raj: Why?// Leonard: It’s just not a good time.// Sheldon: Leonard has a lady over.// Howard: Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?// Leonard: No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour.// Howard: Hang on, there really is a lady here?// Leonard: Uh-huh.// Howard: And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?// Leonard: I’m not anticipating coitus.// Howard: So she’s available for coitus?// Leonard: Can we please stop saying coitus?// Sheldon: Technically that would be coitus interruptus.// Penny: Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!// Howard: Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.// Penny: Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower.// Howard: Bon douche.// Penny: I’m sorry?// Howard: It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages.// Leonard: Save it for your blog, Howard.// Howard: See-ka-tong-guay-jow.// Scene: In the bathroom.// Leonard: Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry.// Penny: Okay. Thanks.// Leonard: You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll….// Penny: Hey, Leonard?// Leonard: The hair products are Sheldon’s.// Penny: Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.// Leonard: A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.// Penny: It’s okay if you say no.// Leonard: Oh, I’ll probably say yes.// Penny: It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.// Leonard: Wow.// Scene: Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonard’s car// Sheldon: I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.// Leonard: Must we?// Sheldon: Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?// Leonard: She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.// Leonard: Which is?// Sheldon: You think with your penis.// Leonard: That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.// Sheldon: Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV.// Leonard: Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.// Sheldon: No I don’t. And neither do you.// Leonard: Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.// Sheldon: You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.// Leonard: To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.// Sheldon: So we get to have a scene with him?// Leonard: No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him.// Sheldon: Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV.// Scene: Back at the apartment.// Penny (to Raj): So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?// (Raj looks at her, looks back at his food, takes a mouthful).// Penny: Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English?// Howard: Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women.// Penny: Really, why?// Howard: He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box?// Scene: Outside Penny’s old apartment building.// Leonard (pushes buzzer): I’ll do the talking.// Voice from buzzer: Yeah.// Leonard: Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV.// Voice: Get lost.// Sheldon: Okay, thanks for your time.// Leonard: We’re not going to give up just like that.// Sheldon: Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.// Leonard: Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.// Sheldon: My apologies. What’s your plan.// (Leonard starts rattling the doors violently.)// Sheldon: It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.// Leonard: Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.// (Two girl scouts arrive carrying bags of cookies. One runs her hand down the intercom, pushing all the buttons. The door is buzzed open.)// Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is?// Leonard: Just grab the door.// Scene: Outside Penny’s ex-boyfriend’s apartment.// Leonard: This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking.// Sheldon: Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle.// Enormous man: Yeah?// Leonard: I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.// Sheldon: From the intercom.// Man: How the hell did you get in the building?// Leonard: Oh. We’re scientists.// Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ.// Scene: Outside the apartment building. Leonard and Sheldon exit. They are not wearing trousers.// Sheldon: Leonard.// Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.// Sheldon: You’re going to have to call her.// Scene: On the stairs of Sheldon and Leonard’s building.// Leonard: Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this.// Sheldon: It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last.// Leonard: And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.// Sheldon: Well you got me out of my pants.// Leonard: Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone.// Sheldon: Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone.// Leonard: Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend.// Sheldon: And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.// Scene: Inside Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.// Howard: This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.// Penny: Wow, cool tiger.// Howard: Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.// Penny: Uh, sounds interesting.// Howard: So you’ll think about it?// Penny: Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it.// Raj: Smooth.// Leonard: We’re home.// Penny: Oh, my God, what happened?// Leonard: Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.// Penny: I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass.// Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.// Sheldon: That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?// Penny: Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?// Leonard: Really? Great.// Sheldon: Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you?// Leonard: Our babies will be smart and beautiful.// Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.// Scene: All five in Leonard’s car.// Leonard: Is Thai food okay with you Penny?// Penny: Sure.// Sheldon: We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.// Penny: So?// Sheldon: They’re both curry based cuisines.// Sheldon: They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.// Penny: Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.)// Howard: Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.// Penny: That sounds like fun.// Howard (sings): Baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me.// Sheldon: I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy.// Written by Chuck Lorre and Bill PradySeries 01 Episode 02 – The Big Bran Hypothesis// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are present.// Leonard: There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.// Howard: But does it have peanut oil?// Leonard: Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.// Sheldon: Since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.// Raj: Are there any chopsticks?// Sheldon: You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food.// Leonard: Here we go.// Sheldon: Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.// Leonard: Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. (There is a knock on the door.) I’ll get it.// Howard: Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.// (Leonard opens door to Penny, steps into hallway)// Penny: Hey Leonard.// Leonard: Oh, hi Penny.// Penny: Am I interrupting.// Leonard: No.// Sheldon (off): You’re not swelling, Howard.// Howard (off): No, no, look at my fingers, they’re like Vienna sausages.// Penny: Sounds like you have company.// Leonard: They’re not going anywhere. (Closes door, staying in hallway.) So, you’re coming home from work. That’s great. How was work.// Penny: Well, you know, it’s the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.// Leonard: So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.// Penny: Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was….// Leonard: Yes.// Penny: Oh. Okay, great, I’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so…. (apartment door opens, Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear) Oh! Hel…hello!// Howard: (speaks a phrase in Russian).// Penny: I’m sorry?// Howard: Haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?// Penny: No, I haven’t.// Howard: Get used to it.// Penny: Yeah, I probably won’t, but… Hey Sheldon.// Sheldon: Hi.// Penny: Hey Raj! (Raj looks uncomfortable) Still not talking to me, huh?// Sheldon: Don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women.// Howard: He can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!// Leonard: So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?// Penny: Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.// Leonard: Yeah, no problem.// Penny: Great, here’s my spare key. Thank you.// Leonard: Penny, wait.// Penny: Yeah?// Leonard: Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?// Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?// Sheldon: You’re kidding, right?// Penny: Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?// Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together: One. (Raj raises one finger).// Sheldon: You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.// Penny: Yes, I know, men can’t fly.// Sheldon: Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.// Leonard: Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.// Sheldon: In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.// Leonard: Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength.// Sheldon: Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun.// Howard: Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.// Sheldon: Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.// Penny: I’m just going to go wash up.// Leonard: I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.// Sheldon: Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We’re locked out.// Raj: Also, the pretty girl left.// Credit sequence.// Scene: Ground floor hallway of the apartment building. Leonard is signing for the delivery.// Leonard: Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to (delivery man leaves) oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves.// Sheldon: I hardly think so.// Leonard: Why not?// Sheldon: Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.// Leonard: We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter… (starts to move package) I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this.// Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.// Leonard: Do you have any ideas?// Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.// Time shift, Leonard and Sheldon are now lowering the package onto the bottom of the stairs.// Leonard: Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.// Sheldon: Exactly half.// Leonard (snarkily): Exactly half. Let’s push. Okay, see, it’s moving, this is easy, all in the math.// Sheldon: What’s your formula for the corner.// Leonard: What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.// (Sheldon heads up the stairs. The package slides back down to the bottom.)// Sheldon: Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.// Time shift, they now have the package on an upstairs hallway, not their own.// Sheldon: You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?// Leonard: Men do things for women without expecting sex.// Sheldon: Yeah, those are men who just had sex.// Leonard: I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds.// Quick cut to the hallway of their floor, they are nearing the top of the staircase.// Leonard: Almost there, almost there, almost there. (Lets go of package, it starts to slip down)// Sheldon: No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not.// Scene: Inside Penny’s apartment. They are laying the package down on the floor.// Sheldon: Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!// Leonard: You okay?// Sheldon: No, it hurt… (looking around) Great Caesar’s Ghost, look at this place?// Leonard: So Penny’s a little messy.// Sheldon: A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale.// Leonard: Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?// Sheldon: No.// Leonard: Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.// Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times.// Leonard: Come on, we should go.// Sheldon: Hang on.// Leonard: What are you doing?// Sheldon: Straightening up.// Leonard: Sheldon, this is not your home.// Sheldon: This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.// Leonard: When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place.// Sheldon: Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.// Leonard: What were you doing in his closet?// Sheldon: I helped run some cable for a webcam.// Penny (entering): Hey guys.// Leonard: Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.// Penny: Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?// Sheldon: (sucks in breath)// Sheldon: No?// Leonard: Well, we’ll get out of your hair.// Penny: Oh, great, thank you again (she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa).// Sheldon: Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you.// Penny: What’s he talking about?// Leonard: It’s a joke.// Penny: I don’t get it.// Leonard: Yeah, he didn’t tell it right.// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom, he is asleep. Sound of door opening and closing somewhere else is heard. Leonard wakes, puts on his glasses and looks at the clock. It is 2:16.// Leonard: Sheldon?// Scene: The living room. Leonard enters carrying a light sabre.// Leonard: Sheldon? Hello?// (Notices front door is open, turns off light sabre.)// Scene: Penny’s apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is cleaning. Leonard enters.// Leonard: Sheldon!// Sheldon: Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.// Leonard: Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean.// Sheldon: I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this.// Leonard: Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?// Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.// Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.// Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.// Leonard: Sheldon, we have to get out of here.// (Penny snores)// Sheldon: You might want to speak in a lower register.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.// Leonard: That’s ridiculous. (Penny snores again.)// Sheldon: No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that’s ridiculous.// Leonard (doing likewise): Fine. I accept your premise, now please let’s go.// Sheldon: I am not leaving until I’m done.// Leonard: O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).// Sheldon: If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.// Leonard: Oh, what the hell.// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s living room, morning. Sheldon enters, singing to himself.// Sheldon: Morning.// Leonard: Morning.// Sheldon: I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.// Leonard: I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.// Sheldon: Sarcasm?// Leonard: You think?// Sheldon: Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life.// Leonard: You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.// Sheldon: You don’t think that crosses a line?// Leonard: Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.// Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?// Leonard: No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.// Sheldon: Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.// Penny (voice off): Son of a Bitch!// Leonard: Penny’s up.// Penny (voice off): You sick, geeky bastards!// Leonard: How did she know it was us?// Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.// Penny (voice off): Leonard!// Leonard: God, this is going to be bad.// Sheldon: Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.// Penny (entering): You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?// Leonard: Yes, but, only to clean.// Sheldon: Really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se.// Penny: Give me back my key.// Leonard: I’m very, very sorry.// Penny: Do you understand how creepy this is.// Leonard: Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.// Penny: In my apartment, while I was sleeping.// Sheldon: And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor.// Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?// Sheldon: Depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading “Sarcasm”) Oh!// Penny: God!// Leonard: Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.// Penny: Stay away from me.// Leonard: Sure, that’s another way to go.// Sheldon: Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm. (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a little non-responsive.// Leonard: You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What’s funny?// Sheldon: That wasn’t sarcasm?// Sheldon: Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny’s door.) I have a masters and two PhD’s, I should not have to do this.// Penny (opening door): What?// Sheldon: I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his face.) I did what I could.// Scene: The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.// Penny: Hey Raj. (Raj stands looking uncomfortable.) Hey, listen, I don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I’m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?// Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk): Ooh, she’s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?// Penny: You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don’t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?// Raj (internally): She’s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I’d be better off with an Indian girl. We’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.// Penny: It’s obvious that they meant well, but I’m just, I’m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it’s just freaking me out.// Raj (internally sings an Indian lullaby.)// Penny: I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn’t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?// Raj (internally): She asked me a question. I should probably nod. (Does.)// Penny: That’s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You’re a doll. (She hugs him.)// Raj (internally): Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. (Does.)// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game.// Howard (jumping off game mat): Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.// Leonard: It’s fine. You win.// Howard: What’s his problem?// Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.// Howard: Been there.// Raj (entering): Hello. Sorry I’m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.// Howard: Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?// Raj: Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.// Leonard: What did she say? Is she still mad at me?// Raj: Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me.// Howard: She hugged you? How did she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard.) Is that her perfume I smell?// Raj: intoxicating, isn’t it?// Scene: The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny’s door. It opens.// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Oh.// Penny: What’s going on?// Leonard: Um, here’s the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….// Penny: Leonard.// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny (hugs him): We’re okay. (Kisses him on cheek. Closes door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door.)// Scene: Penny’s apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to construct furniture.// Leonard: Six two inch dowels.// Sheldon: Check.// Leonard: One package, Phillips head screws.// Penny: Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.// Leonard: No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering.// Sheldon: Considering what? How great this place looks?// Howard (across room with Raj): Oh boy, I was afraid of this.// Howard: These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.// Penny: Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.// Leonard: It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.// Sheldon: We could put her stereo back there.// Leonard: And control it how?// Sheldon: Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.// Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): Good point, how you gonna cool it?// Penny: Hey guys, I got this.// Sheldon: Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?// Leonard: Also inefficient, and might be loud.// Howard: How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC…// Penny: Guys, this is actually really simple.// Howard: Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.// Leonard: Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?// Sheldon: And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.// Penny: Guys, it’s hot in here, I think I’ll just take off all my clothes.// Leonard: Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.// Sheldon: Right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink.// Howard: Perfect, Leonard, why don’t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.// Leonard: Meet back here in an hour?// Howard: Done.// Leonard: Got it. (They all leave).// Penny: Okay, this place does look pretty good.// Teleplay: Robert Cohen & Dave Goetsch// Story: Chuck Lorre & Bill PradySeries 01 Episode 03 – The Fuzzy Boots Corollary// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are using laptops. All are wearing microphone headsets.// Howard: Alright, just a few more feet, and…. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.// Sheldon: Good lord!// Raj: Oooh.// Leonard: Don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.// Howard: Stay frosty, there’s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.// Leonard: Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.// Sheldon: Lock and load.// Howard: Raj, blow up the gates.// Raj: Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!// Howard: Don’t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.// Leonard: Stay in formation.// Howard: Leonard, you’ve got one on your tail.// Leonard: That’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, I’ll swat him off.// Raj: I’ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!// Leonard: Raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!// Raj: Oooh, he’s got me.// Howard: Sheldon, he’s got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!// Sheldon: I’ve got the Sword of Azeroth!// Leonard: Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.// Sheldon: There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!// Howard: Leonard look out!// Leonard: Dammit man, we’re dying here.// Sheldon: Goodbye, peasants.// Leonard: The bastard teleported.// Raj: He’s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.// Leonard: You betrayed us for money, who are you?// Sheldon: I’m a rogue knight elf, don’t you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”// Howard: I am the Swordmaster!// Credits sequence// Scene: The same.// Sheldon: Wooh, I’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.// Leonard: No, I can’t look at you or your avatar right now.// (Sound of female laughter from out in the hall).// Howard: Sounds like your neighbour’s home.// Leonard: Excuse me.// Sheldon: Don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.// Leonard: Oh, right, right right right right.// Howard: Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.// Leonard (exiting to hallway): Penny, the mailman did it again, he… (looks up to see Penny kissing a hunky man) Oh! Sorry.// Penny: Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.// Doug: What’s up bro.// Leonard: Not much. Bro.// Penny: Is, is everything okay.// Leonard: Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.// Penny: Thank you, I’ve got to talk to that mailman.// Leonard: Oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.// Penny: Okay, well, thank you, again.// Leonard: No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! (Returns to apartment).// Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts.// Raj: What’s the matter.// Leonard: No, I’m fine. Penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…// Howard: Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?// Leonard: What is wrong with you?// Howard: I’m a romantic.// Sheldon: Please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.// Leonard: No, I’m not jealous, I’m just a little concerned for her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with.// Howard: Because he looked better than you?// Leonard: Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.// Sheldon: Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again.// Howard: I disagree, love is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray.// Leonard: Well, I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.// Raj: Like who?// Leonard: I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?// Sheldon: The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: Well, I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.// Howard: I don’t know, you guys work in the same lab.// Leonard: So?// Howard: There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I’m… a bit of a self-taught expert.// Leonard: Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.// Howard: Oh, then you’re probably okay.// Scene: Howard and Lesley’s lab.// Leonard: Hello Lesley.// Lesley: Hi Leonard.// Leonard: Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.// Lesley: Goggles, Leonard.// Leonard: Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.// Lesley: Hang on. I’m trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o’ noodles.// Leonard: Pfff, I’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.// Lesley: Wait, are you asking me out?// Leonard: I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don’t need to quibble over terminology.// Lesley: What sort of experiment would you propose?// Leonard: There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.// Lesley: Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.// Leonard: Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.// Lesley: Well, why don’t we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.// Leonard: You mean, kiss you now?// Lesley: Yes.// Leonard: Can you define the parameters of the kiss?// Lesley: Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?// Leonard: Thank you. (Takes mint). Shall I count down from three?// Lesley: No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.// (They kiss.)// Lesley: What do you think.// Leonard: You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.// Lesley: Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal.// Leonard: None?// Lesley: None.// Leonard: Ah. Well, thank you for your time.// Lesley: Thank you.// (They shake hands. Leonard leaves. Then returns.)// Leonard: None at all?// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s flat. Sheldon, Raj and Howard are playing Jenga.// Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn’t, would you want me to tell you?// Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot, will I be able to handle it?// Howard: Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.// Sheldon: Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?// Raj: You might be bound by them right now.// Howard: That’s true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?// Sheldon: Of course not.// Howard: Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?// Sheldon: Well, no.// Howard: I smell robot.// Leonard (entering): Hey, what’s going on.// Sheldon: The internet’s been down for half an hour.// Raj: Also, Sheldon may be a robot.// Howard: So, how did it go with Lesley?// Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.// Sheldon: Oh, I’ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don’t know if I can take it.// Raj: You could power down.// Howard: Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.// Scene: A salsa class. The four guys and a random fat bloke salsa opposite five middle-aged women.// Class instructor: Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven.// Howard (to Leonard): I think Mrs Tishman’s got her eye on you. I’ve been there, you’re in for a treat.// Scene: The flat, Leonard is entering, singing to himself a depressing emo song.// Sheldon: Oh, good lord.// Leonard (singing): You don’t know me, you don’t wear my chains… God, that’s a good song.// Sheldon: If you’re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. (Leonard is taking supplies out of a bag) Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.// Leonard: I know what you’re thinking, I’ve taken your asthma into account. There’s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.// Sheldon: Leonard, listen to me…// Leonard: I’ve been thinking about names, I’m kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.// Sheldon: Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?// Leonard: Maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat.// Sheldon: Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.// Leonard: It doesn’t matter. The woman’s not interested in me, the woman rejected me.// Sheldon: Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.// Leonard: You’re right. I didn’t ask her out, I should ask her out.// Sheldon: No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don’t buy a cat.// Leonard: No, but you’re right. I should march over there and ask her out.// Sheldon: Oh, goody, we’re getting a cat.// Scene: The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny’s door.// Penny (opening door): Ah, hey Leonard.// Leonard: Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh… I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.// Penny: Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?// Leonard: There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.// Penny: Supper?// Leonard: Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.// Penny: Uh, six thirty’s great.// Leonard: Really? Great!// Penny: Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.// Leonard: Us guys?// Penny: You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all’s coming?// Leonard: They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.// Penny: Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.// Leonard: Great. Did we say a time?// Penny: Six thirty.// Leonard: And that’s still good for you.// Penny: It’s fine.// Leonard: Cos it’s not carved in stone.// Penny: No, six thirty’s great.// Leonard: I’ll get my chisel.// Penny: Why?// Leonard: To… carve the… okay, I’ll see you six thirty.// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment. Leonard enters from bedrooms, dressed in a smart shirt and trousers. They are covered in sweat stains.// Leonard: How do I look?// Sheldon: Could you be more specific?// Leonard: Can you tell I’m perspiring a little?// Sheldon: No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?// Leonard: Six thirty.// Sheldon: Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.// Leonard: Is it too much?// Sheldon: Not if you’re a rugby team.// Leonard: By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.// Sheldon: Why would I join you?// Leonard: No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such a good idea.// Sheldon: Oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.// Leonard: You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.// Sheldon: Of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.// Leonard: You could have stopped at “it could go well.”// Sheldon: If I could of, I would of.// Leonard: I mean, I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!// Sheldon: Is the sex starting now?// Leonard: I’m having a panic attack.// Sheldon: Oh, okay, well then, calm down.// Leonard: If I could calm down I wouldn’t be having a panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack.// Sheldon: Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.// Leonard: Why?// Sheldon: Just do it.// Leonard: Okay.// Sheldon: Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: It’s a bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.// Leonard: Oh, who am I kidding, I can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.// Sheldon: Me?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: What should I tell her.// Leonard: I don’t know. Tell her I’m sick.// Sheldon: Okay.// Leonard: Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.// Sheldon: Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.// Leonard: Give me the phone.// Sheldon: But I thought you wanted to cancel?// Leonard: I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.// Sheldon: Why would she be expecting me?// Leonard: Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.// Scene: A restaurant.// Penny: So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?// Leonard: Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet.// Penny: Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.// Leonard: You’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common.// Penny: How?// Leonard: We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.// Penny: So, what’s new in the world of physics?// Leonard: Nothing.// Penny: Really, nothing?// Leonard: Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”// Penny: Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up.// Leonard: What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?// Penny: Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well.// Leonard: Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.// Penny: Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he’s nice and funny, but…// Waitress: Can I get you started with some drinks?// Leonard: No, (waves her away) You were saying, but…// Penny: I’d like a drink.// Leonard: Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll get her back.// Penny: Okay, well, you know, it’s just me. I’m still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.// Leonard: Ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex.// Penny: It’s just, it’s my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it’s just thirty six meaningless of… well, you know.// Leonard: I’m not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer.// Penny: No, it’s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.// Leonard: Well, chafing, right?// Penny: Emotionally.// Leonard: Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? (Penny nods.) I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.// Leonard: Physics. (He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side).// Penny: Wow, centrifugal force!// Leonard: Actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. (The olive drops.) Excuse me. (Leonard disappears under table.)Now, if you were riding on the olive, you’d be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would (he bangs his head on the underside of the table.)// Penny: Are you okay?// Leonard: Yeah, I’m okay. Did you spill ketchup?// Penny: No.// Leonard: I’m not okay.// Scene: The stairwell of the apartment building.// Penny: Are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?// Leonard: No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding.// Penny: I know, but you did throw up. Isn’t that a sign of a concussion?// Leonard: Yes, but I get car sick too, so…// Penny: Okay.// Leonard: Sorry about your car, by the way.// Penny: Oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window.// Leonard: The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.// Penny: Yeah, me too. Um, good night. (Leonard turns across hallway.) Leonard?// Penny: Was this supposed to be a date?// Leonard: This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.// Penny: Okay, I was just checking.// Leonard: When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I’m going to go lay down for a while, good night.// Scene: The apartment, Leonard enters.// Sheldon: So, how was your date?// Leonard: Awesome!// Sheldon: Score one for liquor and poor judgement.// Teleplay: Bill Prady & Steven Molaro// Story: Chuck LorreSeries 01 Episode 04 – The Luminous Fish Effect// Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.// Sheldon: I’ve been thinking about time travel again.// Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?// Sheldon: Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.// Leonard: Interesting.// Sheldon: Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.// Leonard: Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? (Exiting the apartment.)// Sheldon: It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.// Leonard: Then I guess congratulations are in order.// Sheldon: No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I’m not going to enjoy this party.// Leonard: I know, I’m familiar with you.// Sheldon: At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.// Leonard: Yes, I was there.// Sheldon: You know what’s interesting about caves, Leonard?// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: Nothing.// Leonard: Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.// Sheldon: How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.// Leonard: Mahalo’s a nice touch.// Sheldon: Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.// Leonard: Interesting, you should lead with that.// Scene: The department party. Sheldon, Raj and Leonard are at the buffet table.// Raj: Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.// Leonard: You don’t have buffets in India?// Raj: Of course, but it’s all Indian food. You can’t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.// Sheldon: Well here’s an interesting turn of events.// Leonard: What. (Sees Howard entering with a statuesque blonde) Howard brought a date?// Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.// Howard: Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. (Puts arm around her.)// Summer: I already told you, touching’s extra.// Howard: Right. Sorry.// Leonard (to Sheldon): Here comes our new boss, be polite.// Gablehouser: Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.// Howard: Howard Wolowitz.// Gablehouser: Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?// Sheldon: An actual real scientist. (To Leonard) How was that?// Scene: The stairwell of the apartment building. Sheldon is carrying a box of his things.// Sheldon: I can’t believe he fired me.// Leonard: Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.// Sheldon: In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”// Credit sequence.// Scene: The apartment, Sheldon is in the kitchen cooking, Leonard enters.// Leonard: Morning// Sheldon: Morning.// Leonard: You’re making eggs for breakfast?// Sheldon: This isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment.// Leonard: Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.// Sheldon: I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.// Leonard: Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.// Sheldon: As do I.// Leonard: You know, I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.// Sheldon: I don’t want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I’m going to savour it.// Leonard: Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.// Sheldon: I’m not just fixing my eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs.// Leonard: And we all thank you.// (Sheldon takes his eggs and sits down. Takes a photograph of them. Writes in his notebook, then takes a forkful. Writes in notebook again.)// Sheldon: Use new eggs. (There is a knock on the door).// Penny (popping her head round): Hi, hey. I’m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?// Sheldon: Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.// Penny: I’m sorry?// Sheldon: I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.// Penny: Four dozen?// Sheldon: Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.// Penny: Okay, one more time?// Sheldon: Never mind, you won’t get it right, I’d better come with you.// Penny: Oh, yay!// Scene: Penny’s car// Penny: How come you didn’t go into work today.// Sheldon: I’m taking a sabbatical, because I won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds.// Penny: So you got canned, huh?// Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.// Penny: Well, maybe it’s all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.// Sheldon: No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.// Penny: No, no, I meant…// Sheldon: Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.// Penny: Never mind.// Sheldon: Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.// Penny: We’re fine.// Sheldon: Look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars.// Penny: Oh, sure I am.// Sheldon: No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.// Penny: 120?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?// Penny: Well, yeah.// Sheldon: Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb.// Penny: Let’s say 4,390.// Sheldon: Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course.// Scene: The supermarket.// Sheldon: This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.// Penny: Thank you.// Sheldon: No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.// Penny: Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn’t you say you needed some eggs.// Sheldon: Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.// Penny: Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.// Sheldon: No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit.// Penny: Interesting.// Sheldon: Isn’t it?// Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.// Sheldon (as Penny selects vitamin supplements): Oh boy.// Penny: What now?// Sheldon: Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.// Penny: Well, maybe that’s what I was going for.// Sheldon: Well then you’ll want some manganese.// Scene: On the stairwell of the apartment building.// Sheldon: That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.// Penny: Oh, I don’t know Sheldon, it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.// Sheldon: Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time.// Penny: What?// Sheldon: Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.// Penny: You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?// Sheldon: Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?// Penny: Okay, I’m not talking about this with you.// Sheldon: Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? (Penny shuts door in his face.) Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?// Scene: The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.// Leonard (entering): Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.// Sheldon: I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.// Leonard: What’s with the fish?// Sheldon: It’s an experiment.// Leonard: What happened to your scrambled egg research?// Sheldon: Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be.// Leonard: So… fish.// Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.// Leonard: Fish nightlights.// Sheldon: It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!// Leonard: Mum’s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.// Sheldon: Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do.// Leonard: Like luminous fish.// Sheldon: Shhhhh!// Leonard: Right… I didn’t….// Sheldon: That’s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we’re going to be rich.// Scene: The stairwell of the apartment building.// Leonard: Thank you for coming on such short notice.// Mrs Cooper: You did the right thing calling.// Leonard: I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession. (They enter the apartment. Sheldon is weaving on a loom. He is wrapped in a poncho.) This is a particularly disturbing one.// Sheldon (looking round): Mommy.// Mrs Cooper: Hi baby.// Sheldon (mouths): You called my mother?// Mrs Cooper: Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Mrs Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?// Sheldon: I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?// Mrs Cooper: Leonard called me.// Sheldon: I know, but why?// Leonard: Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.// Sheldon: This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother.// Leonard: Really, when was the last time you left the house.// Sheldon: I went to the market with Penny.// Leonard: That was three weeks ago.// Sheldon: Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby.// Mrs Cooper: Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.// Sheldon: Yes, well I’m not a child, I’m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother.// Leonard: Where are you going?// Sheldon: To my room, and no-one’s allowed in.// Mrs Cooper: He gets his temper from his daddy.// Leonard: Oh.// Mrs Cooper: He’s got my eyes.// Leonard: I see.// Mrs Cooper: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.// Scene: Everyone but Sheldon is in the kitchen of the apartment.// Leonard: Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.// Sheldon (off): I’m not hungry.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, don’t trouble yourself, he’s stubborn. He may stay in there ‘til the Rapture.// Penny: Are we so sure that’s a bad thing?// Mrs Cooper: I’ll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.// Howard: Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, honey that ain’t going to work, but you keep trying. (To Raj) I made chicken, I hope that isn’t one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it’s a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it.// Leonard: That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?// Mrs Cooper: Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.// Leonard: Sounds like a wise man.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.// Penny: Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it’s against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.// Penny: What happened?// Mrs Cooper: Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.// Leonard: A death ray?// Mrs Cooper: Well, that’s what he called it, didn’t even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple.// Both Leonard and Penny laugh, a little too forced.// Leonard: No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends.// Mrs Cooper: Did I pluck a nerve there?// Howard: Oh yeah.// Mrs Cooper: Okay. Alright everybody, it’s time to eat. (Everybody begins to do so) Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. (To Raj and Howard) Now after a moment of silent meditation I’m going to end with “In Jesus’ Name” but you two don’t feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.// Time shift// Penny: Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had.// Mrs Cooper: It was always Sheldon’ s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?// Penny: Love?// Mrs Cooper: Lard.// Sheldon emerges from the bedroom area.// Howard: Hey, look who’s come out….// Mrs Cooper: Shhh! You’ll spook him. He’s like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.// Sheldon crosses to the cobbler, takes some and puts it on a plate. Looks round at the group in the matter of a frightened animal. Everyone but Leonard looks down at their meal.// Leonard: This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You’re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. (Sheldon scuttles away)// Mrs Cooper: You don’t hunt, do you?// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. He is building a model of some kind of double helix. There is a knock on the door.// Mrs Cooper (entering): Good morning, snicker-doodle.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?// Sheldon: It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.// Mrs Cooper: But intelligently designed by a creator, right?// Sheldon: What do you want, mom?// Mrs Cooper: You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?// Sheldon: Yeah.// Mrs Cooper: Well, I’m done fishing. (Throwing a pair of trousers on the bed) You put those on.// Sheldon: What for?// Mrs Cooper: Because you’re going to go down to your office, you’re going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back.// Sheldon: No.// Mrs Cooper: I’m sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”// Sheldon: I’m not going to apologise, I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.// Mrs Cooper: Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it’s okay to be smarter than everybody but you can’t go around pointing it out.// Sheldon: Why not?// Mrs Cooper: Because people don’t like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let’s get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let’s shove off. (Exits)// Sheldon: Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.// Scene: The kitchen// Mrs Cooper: Problem solved.// Leonard: Really? That’s impressive.// Mrs Cooper: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.// Scene: Dr Gablehouser’s office// Mrs Cooper: Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?// Gablehouser: Well, actually….// Mrs Cooper: Sheldon, he’s just doodling, get in here.// Sheldon: Dr Gablehouser.// Gablehouser: Dr Cooper.// Mrs Cooper: Let’s go, baby, we’re losing daylight.// Sheldon: Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.// Gablehouser (to Mrs Cooper): I’m sorry, we haven’t been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser.// Mrs Cooper: Mary Cooper, Sheldon’s mom.// Gablehouser: Now that’s impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, aren’t you sweet, his father’s dead.// Gablehouser: Recently?// Mrs Cooper: Long enough.// Gablehouser (indicating chair): Please. Sheldon, shouldn’t you be working?// Sheldon (leaving): Okay.// Leonard: Hey, how did it go?// Sheldon: I got my job back.// Leonard: Really? What happened?// Sheldon: I’m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.// Leonard: That narrows it down.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Mrs Cooper is tucking him in.// Mrs Cooper: I’m very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.// Sheldon: Thanks, mom. Mom?// Mrs Cooper: Mmm-hmm?// Sheldon: Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?// Mrs Cooper: We’ll see. Sleep tight.// Sheldon turns over to sleep in the glow of a luminous goldfish.// Teleplay: David Litt & Lee Aronsohn// Story: Chuck Lorre & Bill PradySeries 01 Episode 05 – The Hamburger Postulate// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory// Sheldon: Alright, I’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.// Howard: Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.// Leonard: No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.// Raj: Why don’t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.// Penny: Hi, you guys ready to order?// Howard: Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?// Leonard: And Orcs!// Penny: I’ll be back.// Raj: Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.// Penny: Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.// Howard: What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?// Penny: A shower.// Howard: I’ll take the heart smart platter.// Penny: Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.// Sheldon: We don’t eat here, I don’t know what’s good.// Penny: Well, it’s all good.// Sheldon: Statistically unlikely.// Leonard: Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.// Sheldon: I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the hamburgers here.// Leonard: I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.// Penny: Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?// Sheldon: Can’t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.// Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.// Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?// Penny: Because you are not at Big Boy!// Sheldon: Fine, I’ll have the Barbecue Burger.// Leonard: Make it two.// Sheldon: Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy.// Lesley (entering): Hey Leonard, hi guys.// Leonard: Hey Lesley.// Lesley: I didn’t know you ate here.// Sheldon: We don’t. This is a disturbing aberration.// Leonard: Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.// Howard: And walks in quiet beauty like the night.// Penny: Howard, I’ve asked you not to do that.// Leonard: Lesley and I do research together at the University.// Penny: Oh, wow, a girl scientist.// Lesley: Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I’m glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist.// Leonard: What happened to Elliot Wong?// Lesley: He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?// Leonard: Yeah, sure, why not.// Lesley: Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.// Leonard: Why at my place?// Lesley: Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.// Penny: Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn’t know you played the cello?// Leonard: Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough.// Howard: If you’re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.// Penny: Really? (Howard performs some of the worst beatboxing imaginable.) I’m actually not that into music. So hey, your friend’s really cute, anything going on with you two.// Leonard: Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?// Sheldon: He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.// Leonard: Thank you Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh, I’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?// Penny: Oh, that’s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.// Raj: Oh dear.// Howard: What’s the matter?// Raj: She didn’t take my order.// Howard: How can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her.// Raj: Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.// Scene: The stairwell of the apartment building.// Leonard: What did Penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?// Sheldon: Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable.// Leonard: If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.// Sheldon: You’re a lucky man, Leonard.// Leonard: How so?// Sheldon: You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.// Leonard: Well, what do you think.// Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn’t say I cared.// Credit sequence.// Scene: The apartment living room. The string quartet are practising.// Lesley: I admire your fingering.// Leonard: Thank you.// Lesley: Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.// Time jump// Lesley: Goodnight guys, good job.// Male string quartettist: Thanks.// Female string quartettist: See you next week.// Leonard: That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.// Lesley: You’re welcome. If you’re up for it we could practise that middle section again.// Leonard: Uh, sure, why not.// Lesley: Just so we’re clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I’m sexually available.// Leonard: Really?// Lesley: Yeah, I’m good to go.// Leonard: I thought you weren’t interested in me.// Lesley: That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.// Leonard: You mean my cello?// Lesley: No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I’m seducing you.// Leonard: No kidding?// Lesley: What can I say, I’m a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?// Leonard: Gee, uh…// Lesley: Is it the waitress?// Leonard: Penny? What about her?// Lesley: Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you’re a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.// Leonard: Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no point in bringing it up.// Lesley: You and the waitress then?// Leonard: No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me.// Lesley: So, you’re open to a sexual relationship?// Leonard: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.// Lesley: Good.// Leonard: Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?// Lesley: Why don’t we finish the section first.// Leonard: Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.// (They play, gradually going faster and faster.)// Leonard: I’m good, I’m good to go.// Lesley: Me too. (Exit in direction of bedrooms.)// Scene: The hallway, Sheldon scuttles out of apartment door and crosses to Penny’s. Knocks on it urgently.// Penny (opening door): Oh, hey Sheldon, what’s going on?// Sheldon: I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.// Penny: I’m sorry?// Sheldon: Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.// Penny: Okay, sweetie, I know you think you’re explaining yourself, but you’re really not.// Sheldon: Just come with me.// Jump to the pair of them standing outside Leonard’s bedroom door. Bryan Adams “Have You Ever Loved A Woman” is emerging. There is a tie on the bedroom door.// Sheldon: Well?// Penny: Well what?// Sheldon: What does it mean?// Penny: Oh, come on, you went to college.// Sheldon: Yes, but I was eleven.// Penny: Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re, you know, getting busy.// Sheldon: So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.// Penny: Well, either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.// Lesley (voice off): Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.// Penny: We really shouldn’t be standing here.// Sheldon (entering living room): This is very awkward.// Penny: Oh, come on, you know, Leonard’s had girls over before, right?// Sheldon: Oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.// Penny: Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?// Sheldon: I didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide.// Penny: So, do you know who’s in there?// Sheldon: Well, there’s Leonard. (Picking up violin case) And he’s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930’s gangster.// Penny: Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.// Sheldon: No, no, wait, hold on.// Penny: What’s the matter?// Sheldon: I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?// Penny: Gee, Sheldon, you’re asking the wrong girl. I’m usually on the other side of the tie.// (Sheldon looks lost for a moment. The pulls out his mobile phone and dials.)// Sheldon: Hi, Leonard. It’s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You’re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.// Scene: In Leonard’s Bedroom. Leonard wakes up next to Lesley, puts on glasses and grins.// Scene: Living room, Sheldon is sleeping on the sofa, with his head on Lesley’s Violin case.// Sheldon: Big boy! (Wakes up, looks at watch, wraps self in blanket, walks towards kitchen) Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!// Leonard (entering): Hey, what’s the matter?// Sheldon: My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations.// Leonard: Are you sure?// Sheldon: Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed.// Leonard: Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?// Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having.// Lesley (entering): You’re welcome.// Sheldon: You did this?// Lesley: Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?// Sheldon: Cool?// Lesley: Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.// Leonard: Thank you, I’ll see you at work.// Sheldon: Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!// Lesley: What?// Sheldon: Who told you you could touch my board?// Lesley: No-one.// Sheldon: I don’t come into your house and touch your board.// Lesley: There are no incorrect equations on my board.// Sheldon: Oh, that is so… so…// Lesley: I’m sorry, I’ve got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. (Leaves).// Sheldon: Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.// Scene: The hallway.// Leonard (exiting the apartment): You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she’s still going to be right.// Sheldon (inside): I’m not staring, I’m mulling.// Penny: Oh, hey Leonard.// Leonard: Oh, hi.// Penny: So, how’s it going?// Leonard: Pretty good.// Penny: Just pretty good, I’d think you were doing very good.// Leonard: Pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?// Penny: Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.// Leonard: Sheldon!// Sheldon: I’m coming.// Penny: So, is it serious, do you like her?// Leonard: Wuh, I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, I’m not…. Sheldon, we have to go!// Sheldon: Boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.// Penny: Alright, well, I’ll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.// Leonard: Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.// Sheldon: Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?// Leonard: You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent.// Sheldon: She’s not that intelligent.// Leonard: She fixed your equation.// Sheldon: She got lucky.// Leonard: You don’t believe in luck.// Sheldon: I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.// Leonard: Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.// Sheldon: Leonard?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: I still don’t care.// Scene: Leonard and Lesley’s lab.// Leonard: Hey, Lesley.// Lesley: Careful Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero.// Leonard: Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.// Lesley: Because I’ve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn’t find a knife.// Leonard: So anyway (puts arms around her) Hello.// Lesley: Uh, what are you doing?// Leonard: Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?// Lesley: Okay, uh, what exactly do you think’s going on between us?// Leonard: I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover how the banana felt.// Lesley: Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat’s brain, give him an orgasm button, he’ll push that thing until he starves to death. // Leonard: Who wouldn’t?// Lesley: Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can’t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That’s where you come in.// Leonard: Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?// Lesley: Well, I don’t know about your sex drive, but I’m probably good till New Years.// Leonard: Oh. Okay. Thank you.// Lesley: Thank you!// Leonard: You want to make plans for New Years.// Lesley: Woah, Leonard, please, you’re smothering me.// Leonard (leaving): Sorry.// Howard: Hey, look, it’s Doctor Stud!// Leonard: Doctor what?// Howard: The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.// Leonard: Wha… how did it get on the internet?// Howard: I put it there.// Leonard: Well, how did you know about it?// Raj: A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.// Leonard: Well, that part’s true!// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.// Sheldon: You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.// Leonard: No kidding.// Sheldon: I won’t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.// Leonard: Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.// Sheldon: Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.// Sheldon: Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup.// Penny: So, how’s everything.// Sheldon: Terrific, you’ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.// Penny: Really, oh yay!// Sheldon: Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?// Penny: Um, I don’t know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?// Leonard: Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to work out.// Penny: Oh, oh that’s too bad. Well hey, don’t worry, I’m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. (Walks away smiling).// Leonard: Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?// Sheldon: You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.// Leonard: Are you even listening to me?// Sheldon: Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.// Leonard: Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. (Sheldon nods).Series 01 Episode 06 – The Middle Earth Paradigm// Scene: Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue paint.// Raj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.// Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.// Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.// Howard: Yes, but you don’t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein’s Bar-Mitzvah party.// Leonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.// Sheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.// Leonard: Sheldon, let it go.// Sheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.// Howard: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.// Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.// Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”// Penny (arriving): Oh, hey guys.// Leonard: Hello Penny.// Howard: Morning ma’am.// Penny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?// Sheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.// Penny: Okay, um, oh hey, I’m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.// Leonard: A party?// Penny: Yeah.// Howard: A boy-girl party?// Penny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it’ll just be a bunch of my friends, we’ll have some beer, do a little dancing…// Sheldon: Dancing?// Leonard: Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…// Sheldon: The thing is, we’re not….// Leonard: We’re really more….// Sheldon: No.// Leonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.// Penny: Are you sure? Come on, it’s Halloween.// Sheldon: A Halloween party?// Howard: As in, costumes?// Penny: Well, yeah.// Leonard: Is there a theme?// Penny: Um, yeah, Halloween.// Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?// Penny: As usual, I’m not following.// Leonard: He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…// Penny: Sure.// Sheldon: What about comic-books?// Penny: Fine.// Sheldon: Anime?// Penny: Of course.// Sheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…// Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.// Howard: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.// Credits Sequence// Scene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.// Leonard (off): I’ll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.)// Howard (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume): Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.)// Leonard: Oh, no.// Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)// Raj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!// Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.// Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.// Raj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.// Howard: No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.// Leonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?// All: Agreed.// Leonard: I call Frodo!// All: Damn!// Scene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.// Raj (Entering dressed as Thor): Hey. Sorry I’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.// Leonard: You went with Thor?// Raj: What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he’s not English, but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect.// Howard: I’m not Peter Pan, I’m Robin Hood.// Raj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man.// Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.// Sheldon: I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect.// Leonard: No, it’s not…// Sheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!// Leonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.// Sheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?// Leonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.// Sheldon: Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.// Leonard: All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork.// Scene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny’s door with his bow.// Howard: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver.// Penny (opening door, not in costume): Oh, hey guys.// Leonard: Hey, sorry we’re late.// Penny: Late? It’s 7:05.// Sheldon: And you said the party starts at seven.// Penny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.// Sheldon: It’s 7:05.// Penny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.// Howard: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?// Penny: Probably, but in their own homes.// Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start?// Penny: The parade?// Sheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.// Penny: Oh, Sheldon, I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes.// Sheldon: This party is just going to suck.// Penny: No, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that’s so cute.// Leonard: Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…// Howard: I’m Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.// Penny: No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be.// Leonard: Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect.// Sheldon: Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.// Penny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.// Leonard: Okay.// Sheldon: See, people get it.// Time shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are sitting together around the coffee table.// Raj: Mmmm, by Odin’s beard, this is good Chex Mix.// Howard: No thanks, peanuts, I can’t afford to swell up in these tights.// Sheldon: I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here?// Leonard: We’re socialising. Meeting new people.// Sheldon: Telepathically?// Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!// Raj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry’s.// Leonard: She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat.// Sheldon: And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.// Howard: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough.// Raj: What is your move?// Howard: I’m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together.// Leonard: Where do you get this stuff?// Howard: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.// Raj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.// Howard: If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat.// Nurse Costume Girl: No thanks.// Howard: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.// Leonard: I want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people.// Sheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.// Leonard: How so?// Sheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.// Leonard: Go on.// Sheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”// Leonard: Then what happens?// Sheldon: That’s as far as I’ve gotten.// Leonard: This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in.// Sheldon: Good luck.// Leonard: No, you’re coming with me.// Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so.// Leonard: Come on.// Sheldon: Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?// Leonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.// Sheldon: Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.// Girl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi!// Leonard: Hi.// Sheldon: Hello.// Girl: So, what are you supposed to be?// Sheldon: Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!// Girl: Uh, a choo-choo train?// Sheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!// Girl: A brain damaged choo-choo train?// Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj): How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.)// Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a princess costume.// Sheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!// Girl: I still don’t get it.// Sheldon: I’m the Doppler Effect.// Girl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it’s very insensitive.// Leonard: Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?//  Sheldon: Well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves.// Leonard: Because I’m Frodo.// Sheldon: Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect.// Leonard: Oh no.// Sheldon: What?// Leonard: That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.// Sheldon: What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.// Leonard: If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him.// Sheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now.// Leonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug).// Sheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis.// Leonard: Maybe they just want to be friends.// Sheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.// Leonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.// Sheldon: Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is.// Leonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.// Sheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.// Leonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down.// Sheldon: True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?// Leonard: No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.// Sheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?// Leonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.// Penny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?// Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.// Kurt: What, you’re a zebra, right?// Sheldon: Yet another child left behind.// Kurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?// Leonard: No, I’m a Hobbit.// Kurt: What’s the difference?// Leonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.// Kurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?// Sheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.// Kurt: Well, whatever, why don’t you go hop off on a quest, I’m talking to Penny here.// Leonard: I think we’re all talking to Penny here.// Sheldon: I’m not. No offence.// Kurt: Okay, maybe you didn’t hear me, go away.// Penny: Alright Kurt, be nice.// Kurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.// Penny: Kurt!// Leonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery.// Kurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal?// Penny: Of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right Leonard?// Leonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.// Sheldon: If he understands that, you’re in trouble.// Kurt: So what, I’m unevolved?// Sheldon: You’re in trouble.// Kurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.// Penny: Okay, Kurt, please.// Leonard: No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?// Kurt: Okay, now you’re starting to make me mad.// Leonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?// Kurt: What?// Leonard: I think I’ve made my point.// Kurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.// Sheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.// Leonard: There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.// Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground): C – O – N… frontation!// Penny: Kurt, put him down this instant.// Kurt: He started it.// Penny: I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down.// Kurt: Fine. You’re one lucky little leprechaun.// Sheldon: He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.// Penny: Leonard, are you okay.// Leonard: Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so….// Penny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.// Sheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it’s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.// Scene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.// Leonard: What’s that?// Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Good. There there was really all I had.// Leonard: Good night Sheldon.// Sheldon: Good night Leonard.// Penny (knocking on door and entering): Hey Leonard.// Leonard: Hi Penny.// Penny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.// Leonard: I’m fine.// Penny: I’m so sorry about what happened.// Leonard: It’s not your fault.// Penny: Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.// Leonard: So why was he at your party?// Penny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was… just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I’m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and I’m really drunk and I just want to… (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard’s shoulder.)// Leonard: There there.// Penny: God, what is wrong with me.// Leonard: Nothing, you’re perfect.// Penny: Gah, I’m not perfect.// Leonard: Yes you are.// Penny: You really think so, don’t you? (She kisses hm.)// Leonard: Penny?// Leonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?// Penny: Just…. a lot.// Leonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?// Penny: It might. Boy, you’re really smart.// Leonard: Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius.// Penny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like you?// Leonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive.// Penny: I should probably go.// Leonard: Probably.// Penny (in doorway): Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)// Leonard: That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)// Scene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door.// Sheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)// Howard: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?// Sheldon: He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.// Howard: He’s not the Marvel comic story, he’s the original Norse God.// Sheldon: Thank you for the clarification.// Howard: I’m supposed to give him a ride home.// Sheldon: Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer.// Scene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj.// Butterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You’re gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!// (Raj puts hands behind head with a smug expression on his face.)Series 01 Episode 07 – The Dumpling Paradox// Scene: The apartment, the living room.// Howard: Watch this, it’s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.// Howard’s phone: Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?// Howard: No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.// Howard’s phone: Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader.// Howard: No.// Leonard: Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.// Howard’s phone: Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. (Raj’s phone rings).// Raj: Oh, that’s very impressive. And a little racist.// Sheldon: If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.// Leonard: So? We’ll start now.// Sheldon: Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.// Raj: We can split it two, two and two.// Howard: If we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can’t take it out of bathroom time. (There is a knock on the door.)// Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?// Leonard (opening door): Hey Penny, come on in.// Penny: Hey guys.// Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you’ll have good luck.// Penny: No you won’t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.// Leonard: Sure. What’s going on.// Penny: Well, there’s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she’s like “Hey, how’s California,” and I’m like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it’s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she’s invited herself out here to stay with me.// Sheldon: 8:08.// Penny: Anyway, she got here today, and she’s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.// Howard: Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.// Penny: He really needs to dial it down.// Leonard: So, if you don’t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?// Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she’s kind of family.// Sheldon: You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?// Leonard: Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore.// Penny: No, yeah she’s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where’s Howard?// Howard (voice off): Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you’re new in town.// Sheldon: Oh good grief.// Credit Sequence// Scene: Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard stand in the apartment doorway. Romantic music plays from Penny’s apartment door.// Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment. // Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing Halo.// Leonard: Okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back.// Sheldon: One on one? We don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!// Leonard: Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.// Raj: Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from.// Penny: Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I’ll play.// Leonard: Great idea.// Sheldon: Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.// Penny: Why?// Sheldon: Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.// Penny: Oh, what, what, what?// Sheldon: This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.// Penny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television): Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?// Sheldon: Mine.// Penny: Okay, I got this, lock and load boys.// Leonard: It’s the only way we can play teams.// Sheldon: Yes, but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh…. (another explosion)// Penny: Ha-ha, there goes your head again.// Sheldon: Okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to (explosion) now come on!// Time shift// Sheldon: Raj, Raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me.// Penny: Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!// Leonard: Penny, you are on fire.// Penny: Yeah, so is Sheldon.// Sheldon: Okay, that’s it, I don’t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.// Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.// Sheldon: What?// Penny: This plasma grenade. (Explosion.) Ha! Look, it’s raining you!// Sheldon: You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.// Penny: Gosh, he’s kind of a sore loser, isn’t he?// Leonard: Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.// Penny: Well, it’s been fun.// Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.// Penny: Or we could just have a life.// Leonard: I guess for you that’s an option.// Penny: Good night, Leonard.// Leonard: Good night.// Penny: As usual, nice talking to you Raj (leaves.)// Raj: What do you suppose she meant by that?// Leonard: She’s an enigma, Raj.// Sheldon: And another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab…// Leonard: She’s gone, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Well she could have said goodbye.// Penny (entering again): Okay, I have a problem.// Sheldon: It’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.// Leonard: What’s wrong?// Penny: Um, well, Howard and Christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom.// Leonard: Are you sure?// Penny: Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they’re either having sex or Howard’s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?// Leonard: No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.// Penny: Uh, the couch is good.// Sheldon: Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.// Leonard: Let me guess, you have a problem with this.// Sheldon: Where do I begin?// Leonard: It’s up to you, crazy person’s choice.// Sheldon: Well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I’d ask you to leave.// Leonard: Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?// Sheldon: Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.// Leonard: So?// Sheldon: So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.// Leonard: I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?// Sheldon: No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.// Leonard: Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.// Penny: Hu.. what?// Sheldon: He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it.// Leonard: I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow.// Sheldon: Okay, well since I’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.// Penny: How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?// Sheldon: I suggest no liquids after 11pm.// Leonard: Here you go.// Penny: Thanks Leonard. (Arranges pillows on left of couch.)// Sheldon: Hmmph, wrong.// Penny: I’m listening.// Sheldon: Your head goes on the other end.// Sheldon: It’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.// Penny: I’ll risk it.// Sheldon: Hm!// Penny: Anything else I should know.// Sheldon: Yes. If you use my toothbrush I’ll jump out that window. Please don’t come to my funeral. Have a good night.// Leonard: Sorry about that.// Penny: That’s okay.// Leonard: FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.// Penny: Got it.// Leonard: Well, sleep tight.// Penny: Thanks.// Leonard: Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight.// (Penny turns off light and lies down on couch. Across the room, Raj is still in the kitchen, eating a sandwich. Realising everyone has forgotten about him, he quietly lets himself out. Penny hears the door close, looks worried, then moves her head to the other end of the couch.)// Scene: The following morning. Sheldon is in the kitchen making breakfast. He crosses to the couch, sees Penny sleeping there, looks lost. He is about to sit down on Penny when Leonard enters.// Leonard: What are you doing?// Sheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.// Leonard: Penny’s still sleeping.// Sheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal….// Leonard: I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?// Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.// Penny: Uh, what time is it?// Leonard: Almost 6:30.// Penny: I slept all day?// Leonard: Oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning.// Penny: What the hell is your problem?// Sheldon: Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.// Howard (entering): Ola, nerd-migos.// Penny: Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?// Howard: Oh, yeah, sorry, I’ll have it cleaned.// Penny: That’s okay, keep it. Where’s Christie.// Howard: In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won’t.// Penny: Y-you used my loofah?// Howard: More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!// Penny: You can keep that too.// Howard: Ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.// Christie (voice off): Howard?// Howard: In here my lady.// Christie (entering): Mmmm, there’s my little engine that could.// Howard: chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka (they kiss).// Sheldon: Well there’s one beloved children’s book I’ll never read again.// Christie: Hi, Christie.// Leonard: Leonard.// Sheldon: I’m Sheldon.// Christie: Right, you’re Howard’s entourage.// Penny: Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?// Christie: Oh, well, Howard said he’d take me shopping in Beverley Hills.// Penny: Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded.// Leonard: Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us.// Sheldon: Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B&B.// Howard: Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t Christie stay with me.// Leonard: For one thing you live with your mother.// Howard: I do not, my mother lives with me.// Sheldon: Well then, it’s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I’ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it’s more like Doctor Why Bother.// Leonard: Sheldon you just can’t dictate…// Sheldon: No more talking, everybody go.// Howard: So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?// Christie: What is that, like a Mexican deli?// Howard: I’m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.// Christie: Oh, that’s so cool. My first Jew!// Sheldon: I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers.// Christie: But you’re still taking me shopping, right?// Howard: Anything you want.// Christie: Okay, I’ll go pack my stuff.// Howard: When they perfect human cloning I’m going to order twelve of those.// Leonard: Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?// Howard: Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!// Penny: Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.// Howard: Really?// Penny: Yeah.// Howard: Yay! If you’ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash.// Scene: A Chinese restaurant.// Sheldon: I’m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.// Leonard: We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?// Sheldon: Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?// Leonard: I see a problem.// Sheldon: Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.// Leonard: So, we’ll just order three entrees.// Sheldon: Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling.// Raj: We could cut it into thirds.// Sheldon: Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.// Waiter: Hi fellas. Oh, where’s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?// Sheldon: He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good. (Pointing at waiter) Where he comes from, that’s punishable by death.// Waiter: I come from Sacramento.// Leonard: Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.// Waiter: No substitutions.// Leonard: This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction.// Waiter: Okay, no reductions.// Leonard: Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four.// Raj: That works.// Sheldon: No, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree.// Waiter: No eliminations.// Leonard: If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home.// Sheldon: And divide it how, I’m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.// Leonard: Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.// Sheldon: Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.// Leonard: We don’t order egg rolls.// Sheldon: Exactly, but we’d have to if she was here.// Raj: Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there’s an Indian starving right here.// Leonard: Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for Indian food.// Sheldon: No.// Raj: Uurgh.// Waiter: You are nice boys. Tell you what I’m going to do. I’m going to bring you the four dumplings. When I’m walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.// Sheldon: I’ll know.// Waiter: (wanders away cursing in Mandarin.)// Raj: How about soup?// Leonard: Yeah, we can always divide soup.// Sheldon: What about the won-tons?// Scene: Outside Penny’s door. Leonard knocks.// Penny (answering): Oh, hey guys, what’s up?// Sheldon: It’s Halo night.// Penny: Yeah. Okay. So?// Leonard: Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,// Penny: She’s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.// Leonard: Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?// Sheldon: Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is.// Penny: Oh, that’s so sweet. But I’m going out dancing with a girlfriend.// Sheldon: You can’t go out, it’s Halo night.// Penny: Well, for Penny it’s dancing night.// Sheldon: You go dancing every Wednesday.// Penny: No.// Sheldon: Then it’s not dancing night.// Penny: Look, why don’t I play with you guys tomorrow?// Sheldon: Tonight is Halo night, it’s like talking to a wall.// Penny: Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.// Leonard: Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.// Sheldon: Yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational.// Penny: Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.// Leonard: Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.// Sheldon: Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them.// Sheldon: It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.// Leonard: Aaah, for God’s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.// Sheldon: Your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.// Leonard: No, I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you.// Raj: What’s happening to us? We’re falling apart.// Leonard: Who are you calling?// Sheldon: The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.// Howard (voice): Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.// Christie (voice): And this is Christie Van Der Bell.// Howard (voice): We can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.// Christie (voice): You’re not going to put that on your message are you?// Howard (voice): No, I’m just kidding, I’ll re-record it. (beep)// Scene: Outside Howard’s house.// Leonard: Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.// Sheldon: No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.// Leonard: You’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.// Sheldon: My point.// Christie (voice from within): I’m just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.// Howard’s Mother (voice): Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?// Howard (voice): Ladies, ladies, I’m sure there’s a middle ground.// Christie and Howard’s Mother together: Shut up Howard.// Howard (voice): You girl’s talk, I’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin.// Christie (voice as Howard emerges through door): Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house.// Howard’s Mother (voice): Why don’t you stop butting in where you don’t belong.// Howard: What are you guys doing here?// Howard’s Mother (voice): He’s not a man, he’s a putz, and don’t you take that tone with me, you gold digger.// Christie (voice): What did you call me?// Howard’s Mother (voice): You heard me, and I’ll tell you something else, you’re barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you’re around, Howard is out of the will.// Christie: (voice): You know what, I got better offers, I’m out of here.// Howard’s Mother (voice): That’s right, go back to Babylon, you whore.// Howard: So, Halo night, huh?// Raj: I thought she was the whore of Omaha?// Sheldon: Shhh!// Scene: The apartment, Halo night.// Howard: Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he’s charging his plasma rifle.// Sheldon: I can’t shoot now, I’m cloaking.// Leonard: Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.// Raj: I can’t see him.// Sheldon: That’s why the call it cloaking, dead man.// Leonard: Well then start throwing grenades.// Raj: I’m all out.// Penny (entering with three other sexy women): Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.// Leonard: That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.// Sheldon: We said no tanks.// Raj: There are no rules in hell!// Howard: Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!// Penny: Told yah! (They leave).// Leonard: There’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher.// Raj: All I’ve got is a needler, and I’m all out of ammo.// Sheldon: And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?// Leonard: I thought I heard something.// Raj: What?// Leonard: No, never mind, alright, go.Series 01 Episode 08 – The Grasshopper Experiment// Scene: The Apartment.// Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com.// Leonard: Problem?// Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare.// Leonard: Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?// Sheldon: It’s been in every wallet I’ve owned since I was five.// Leonard: Why?// Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. (Knock on door) It’s right here under Batman’s signature.// Leonard opens door. Raj and Howard are outside. Raj is holding a laptop which is open. His parents are on the screen.// Raj: And this is Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment.// Howard: Guess whose parents just got broadband.// Raj: May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali.// Leonard: Hi.// Dr Koothrappali: Lift up the camera. I’m looking at his crotch.// Raj: Sorry papa.// Dr Koothrappali: Oh, there’s much better. Hi.// Leonard: Hi!// Raj: And over here is Sheldon.// Sheldon: Hi.// Raj: He lives with Leonard.// Mrs Koothrappali: Oh, that’s nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer.// Raj: No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.// Mrs Koothrappali: Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby.// Leonard: Yeah, we’re not like Haroun and Tanweer!// Dr Koothrappali: So are you boys academics like our son?// Together: Yes.// Dr Koothrappali: And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?// Together: Not at all.// Raj: Papa, please don’t start.// Dr Koothrappali: God, it’s just a question, he’s so sensitive.// Raj: Okay, that’s my life, that’s my friends, good to see you, say goodbye.// Together: Bye!// Dr Koothrappali: Wait, wait. Before you go we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends.// Raj: What is it papa.// Dr Koothrappali: Friends.// Howard (as they gather): Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless.// Mrs Koothrappali: Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?// Raj: The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.// Mrs Koothrappali: Yes. Well, now she’s a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information.// Raj: Why did you do that?// Dr Koothrappali: You’re 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.// Raj: But Papa, I’m not supposed…// Mrs Koothrappali: Lalita’s parents approve the match.// Dr Koothrappali: If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season.// Raj: Spring wedding?// Mrs Koothrappali: It’s up to you dear, we don’t want to meddle.// Raj: If you don’t want to meddle, then why are you meddling.// Sheldon: If I may, your parents probably don’t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives.// Raj: Why are you telling me about my own culture?// Sheldon: You seemed confused.// Raj: Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can’t go through…// Mrs Koothrappali: Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it’s Doogie time! Bye bye.// Dr Koothrappali: Bye bye.// Raj: I don’t believe it.// Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser’s been off the air for like, twenty years.// Leonard: Actually, I read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in India.// Sheldon: It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession.// Leonard: I bet you’re right.// Howard: I bet they love Scrubs.// Sheldon: What’s not to love?// Raj: Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?// Sheldon: I suggest you go through with it.// Raj: What?// Sheldon: Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.// Howard: It’s the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.// Leonard: I’m not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.// Howard: Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally.// Sheldon: Understandable, but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.// Howard: Let’s not forget it’s got some really catchy tunes.// All: (various noises of agreement)// Raj: Okay, I know what I’m going to do.// Leonard: What?// Raj: Find new friends.// Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?// Sheldon: No need, we have the special edition.// Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.// Credits sequence// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon (on phone): This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I’m sorry too, but there’s just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don’t have dinosaurs. Well I’ll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you’re texting about me, and I’d really like you to stop.// Raj (entering): Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.// Leonard: Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.// Raj: I’ve got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.// Lalita (voice from Raj’s phone): Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I’m calling you, and, ah… call me back. Bye.// Raj: Can you believe how pushy she is?// Leonard: So don’t call her.// Raj: If I don’t call her, I won’t hear the end of it from my parents.// Leonard: So call her.// Raj: How can I call her, you know I can’t talk to women.// Leonard: I’m done, anybody else?// Howard: Give me the phone.// Raj: Why?// Howard: Just give it to me. (Dials)// Raj: What are you doing?// Howard: Don’t worry, you’ll thank me. (In a fake Indian accent) Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali. (Raj starts to chase Howard across the room.) Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe. (In own voice) You may now thank me.// Raj: For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character?// Howard: Fine, next time make your own date.// Raj: I didn’t want to make this one.// Leonard: Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.// Raj: Great, then we’ll get married, I won’t be able to talk to her, and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.// Howard: Worked for my parents.// Penny (knocking and entering): Hi guys.// Leonard: Oh, hey.// Penny: I need some guinea pigs.// Sheldon: Okay, there’s a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.// Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I’m going to get the hang of talking to you.// Leonard: His mom’s been saying that for years. What’s up?// Penny: Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.// Leonard: Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.// Sheldon: With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.// Penny: So Leonard, how about it?// Leonard: Look, Penny, we’d love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn’t drink, so… (Raj whispers in his ear) Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise.// Leonard: Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.// Penny: Okay, Raj, what’ll it be? (Raj whispers in Leonard’s ear.)// Leonard: Whatever you recommend.// Penny: Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?// Sheldon: I’ll have a diet coke.// Penny: Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.// Sheldon: Fine. I’ll have a virgin cuba libre.// Penny: That’s, um, rum and coke without the rum.// Sheldon: Yes,// Penny: So coke.// Sheldon: Yes. And would you make it diet?// Penny: There’s a can in the fridge.// Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.// Penny: Then swim to Cuba.// Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.// Penny: Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who’s next?// Howard: I’d like to try a slippery nipple.// Penny: Okay, you’re cut off. Anybody need a refill?// Raj: Where did my life go, Penny? One day I’m a carefree batchelor, and the next I’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.// Penny: A… are you talking to me?// Raj: Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course.// Leonard: It’s amazing.// Raj: Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it’s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.// Penny: Okay, sweetie, I think that’s the grasshopper talking.// Raj: And it’s about to tell my parents that I’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.// Penny: Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don’t you just meet this girl and, see what happens.// Raj: Haven’t you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.// Leonard: Um… Raj.// Howard: No, no, let’s see how long it takes him.// Penny: Um, Raj, honey, you say you can’t talk to women but… you’ve been talking to me.// Sheldon: And now we’ll never know.// Raj: You’re right. I… I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?// Penny: I’m fine.// Raj: Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It’s a sweet green miracle.// Penny: Okay, if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it.// Raj: Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?// Penny: Yeah, that. Uh, why don’t you bring her to my restaurant when I’m tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?// Raj: Okay.// Leonard: Wait a minute, what’s the plan here? Let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what’s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?// Scene: The restaurant. // Raj: I can’t believe I’m sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.// Lalita: Well, you are.// Raj: Little Lalita. That’s kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it.// Lalita: No, it’s okay.// Raj: You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?// Lalita: Yes, I do.// Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?// Lalita: Well, I’ve been trying.// Raj: So you’re a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you’re still winning.// Lalita: Yay me!// Leonard (to Penny): You have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious?// Penny: Drinks do not work that way.// Howard: I’d say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail.// Sheldon: Sorry I’m late.// Leonard: What happened?// Sheldon: Nothing, I just really didn’t want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.// Penny: Okay.// Sheldon: In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.// Penny: Oh, I’ll wedge it right in there.// Sheldon: So, how’s Koothrappali d…. oh my Lord.// Sheldon: That’s Princess Punchali.// Leonard: I’m pretty sure her name’s Lalita.// Sheldon: No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.// Howard: Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.// Sheldon: It’s a children’s story.// Howard: Oh, no it isn’t.// Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It’s about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.// Penny: I know the reason.// Leonard: We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?// Sheldon: That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?// Howard: Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but…// Raj: Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn’t it great, she isn’t fat any more!// Sheldon: Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.// Lalita: I’m sorry?// Sheldon: You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.// Lalita: Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?// Sheldon: A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.// Lalita: Oh. Us Indian, or “come to our casino” Indian?// Sheldon: You Indian.// Lalita: Oh.// Sheldon: The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.// Lalita: Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.// Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.// Lalita: Really, so do I.// Raj: But you’re a dentist, he’s nuts.// Lalita: Don’t be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.// Sheldon: It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.// Lalita: Oh my.// Raj: Back off Sheldon.// Sheldon: What?// Raj: If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.// Sheldon: I’m not hitting on her.// Lalita: And I am not your lady.// Howard: And you have no wrath.// Raj: You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.// Lalita: Okay, let’s get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don’t need to be getting this old world crap from you.// Sheldon: Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.// Raj: Oh, screw Princess Punchali.// Lalita: Hey, you can’t talk to me like that.// Raj: But you’re not Princess Punchali.// Sheldon: Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.// Lalita: Sheldon, are you hungry?// Sheldon: I could eat.// Lalita: Let’s go.// Raj: What just happened?// Leonard: Beats the hell out of me.// Howard: I’ll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.// Scene: The apartment. Raj is talking to his parents on the webcam.// Mrs Koothrappali: What are we supposed to say to Lalita’s parents?// Dr Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won’t be able to look at him.// Raj: Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.// Dr Koothrappali: Oh, now you’re a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man.// Leonard: Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn’t entirely Raj’s fault.// Dr Koothrappali: This is a family matter Sheldon.// Leonard: No, I’m Leonard.// Dr Koothrappali: Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.// Raj: But he’s right, Papa, listen to him. (Sheldon enters) You! You are the one who ruined everything!// Mrs Koothrappali: Who is it? We can’t see.// Dr Koothrappali: Turn us, turn us.// Raj: Go ahead, tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren.// Sheldon: How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?// Raj: This has nothing to do with my sperm count.// Mrs Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren’t you Rajesh.// Raj: Yes Mommy.// Mrs Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.// Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.// Sheldon: What did I do?// Leonard: You left with his date. Friends don’t do that to each other.// Sheldon: Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.// Raj: Sorry? That’s all you can say is sorry?// Leonard: Take it, Raj. It’s more than I’ve ever gotten.// Sheldon: And may I point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring.// Dr Koothrappali: Drunk?// Sheldon: And boring, her words.// Dr Koothrappali: I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic.// Raj: I’m not an alcoholic.// Dr Koothrappali: Then why were you drunk?// Raj: It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.// Dr Koothrappali: Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?// Mrs Koothrappali: Don’t embarrass him in front of his friends.// Dr Koothrappali: Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private.// Raj: But Papa, please….// Dr Koothrappali: Now, Rajesh.// Raj (to Leonard and Sheldon): I have to go. // Dr Koothrappali: Now listen to me….// Raj: Please wait until I get into the hall.// Sheldon: Okay, well, good night.// Leonard: Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?// Sheldon: We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn’t already know, and I came home.// Leonard: So you’re not going to see her again?// Sheldon: Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. (Exits)// Leonard: I wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren.// Scene: Penny’s restaurant. Sheldon is on the piano, singing “To Life” from Fiddler on the Roof enthusiastically.// Leonard: I don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him?// Penny: Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.// Leonard: You didn’t?// Penny: Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.Series 01 Episode 09 – The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization// Scene: The apartment, Leonard is attaching something to a lamp.// Leonard: Okay, the X10s are online.// Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this (clicks mouse, lamp switches on) lamp. (The others cheer and clap).// Sheldon: Look at me, look at me, I’ve got goosebumps.// Howard: Are we ready on the stereo?// Raj: Go for stereo.// (Howard clicks mouse again. Also Sprach Zarathustra begins to play. At the climactic notes, the four jump in the air and begin pretend conducting or jumping about in time to the music.)// Penny (entering): Hey guys.// All (calming down, embarrassed): Hello.// Penny: It’s a little loud.// Howard: No problem, turning it down. (Using mouse again) San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax (the music gets quieter) et voila.// Penny: Okay, thanks.// Leonard: Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.// Penny: Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.// Sheldon: No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.// Penny: Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they’re really cheap.// Leonard: No, no, no, you don’t get it, um, Howard, enable public access.// Howard: Public access enabled. (They all stare around for a moment in silence.)// Penny: Boy, that’s brilliant, but I’ll see you.// Leonard: No, hang on, hang on. (The lamp goes off and on again.) See!// Penny: No.// Sheldon: Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.// Penny: Huh, well that’s handy. Um, here’s a question, why?// All together: Because we can. (There is a loud noise)// Sheldon: They found the remote controlled cars.// Penny: Well, wait, wait, what’s on top of them.// Leonard: Wireless webcams, wave hello.// Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.// Sheldon: You may want to put on slacks.// Penny: What? (Seeing red car is trying to get between her legs) Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone.// Leonard: Who’s running the red Corvette?// Howard: That would be me.// Credits sequence// Scene: The same, clearing up.// Sheldon: You know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.// Raj: I don’t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.// Howard: I’m with you. I just have to make sure if I’m a synthetic human I’d still be Jewish. I promised my mother.// Raj: I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that’s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.// Sheldon: Not to mention you’d have to power down on Saturdays.// Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?// Sheldon: Well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam’s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.// Leonard: It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.// Sheldon: I know. I read it before I threw it out.// Leonard: Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.// Sheldon: Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.// Howard: I don’t know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.// Leonard: Forget the parties.// Howard: Forget the parties? What a nerd.// Leonard: Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?// Sheldon: Leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.// Raj: Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”// Howard: I’ve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma’s research methodology is so flawed….// Leonard: Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.// Sheldon: No we don’t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.// Leonard: Okay, let me put it this way, I’m doing it.// Sheldon: You can’t. I’m the lead author.// Leonard: Oh, come on. The only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically.// Sheldon: I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You’re welcome.// Leonard: Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.// Sheldon: It doesn’t need proving.// Leonard: So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?// Sheldon: They’re not supposed to, but they should.// Leonard: Alright, I don’t care what you say, I’m going to the conference and I’m presenting our findings.// Sheldon: And I forbid it.// Leonard: You forbid it?// Sheldon: If I’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is.// Leonard: Oh, you admit that it’s our work.// Sheldon: No, once again, I’m throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.// Leonard: Ah!// Howard: Oh no he dit’nt!// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Penny is looking through his closet.// Penny: So, how’s it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?// Leonard: Not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put’s fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”// Penny: Oh, hey, I didn’t know they still made corduroy suits!// Leonard: They don’t, that’s why I saved this one.// Penny: Okay, well, let’s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.// Leonard: Is this all stuff you want me to try on?// Penny: No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.// Leonard: Oh.// Penny: Seriously, don’t even give it to charity, you won’t be helping anyone. What’s this.// Leonard: Oh, that’s the bottled city of Kandor.// Penny: Uh-huh.// Leonard: You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.// Penny: Oh, nice.// Leonard: It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.// Penny: Here, why don’t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.// Leonard: Great, be right back.// Penny: Well, where you going, just put them on.// Leonard: Here?// Penny: Oh, are you shy?// Leonard: No, I’m not shy.// Penny: Don’t worry, I won’t look.// Leonard: I know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing….// Penny: Sweetie, put the pants on.// Leonard: Putting them on.// Penny: So, you know, isn’t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.// Leonard: No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.// Penny: What is this?// Leonard: Oh, careful. That’s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.// Penny: Oh, why didn’t you wear it at Halloween?// Leonard: Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit.// Penny: Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.// Leonard: Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.// Penny: If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your… your only tie?// Leonard: Ah. Technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So it works as two.// Penny: Oh, sweetie, I don’t think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?// Leonard: Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.// Penny: The… the eighth grade?// Leonard: My last growth spurt.// Penny: Okay, well, I guess we’re back to the corduroy suit.// Leonard: Great.// Penny: Yup. (Leonard picks up paisley shirt) I said no, put it down.// Scene: The ground floor hallway.// Penny: Hey Sheldon!// Sheldon (unlocking his mailbox): Hello Penny. // Penny: Get anything good?// Sheldon: Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.// Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn’t. (Sheldon looks confused). It was a joke. (Sheldon gives a fake laugh.) Yup, tip your waitresses, I’m here all week.// Sheldon: Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.// Penny: Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it. (The begin to climb) Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…// Sheldon: Oh dear God!// Penny: Little misunderstanding, huh.// Sheldon: A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.// Penny: Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.// Sheldon: Huh.// Penny: Well how do you feel?// Sheldon: I don’t understand the question.// Penny: Well I’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend.// Sheldon: Oh. I hadn’t thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.// Penny: Wait… what?// Sheldon: I couldn’t poop this morning.// Penny: You should just talk to him, I’m sure you guys can work this out.// Sheldon: It’s certainly preferable to my plan.// Penny: Which was?// Sheldon: A powerful laxative.// Penny: Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.// Sheldon: Excuse me, little idea?// Penny: Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn’t really understand it but…// Sheldon: Of course you didn’t, he said little idea?// Penny: Uh, well no, no, not in… not in those words.// Sheldon: In what words then, exactly// Penny: Um, gee, the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s// Sheldon: What did he say?// Penny: You had a lucky hunch.// Leonard (coming out of apartment): Hey, Sheldon, I’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don’t….// Sheldon: Don’t you ever speak to me again.// Leonard: What… (Sheldon goes into apartment and slams the door).// Penny: Uh, he… (makes “he’s screwy” hand movements, turns to go).// Scene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed in the corduroy suit.// Leonard: Okay, I’m leaving for the conference.// Sheldon: Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.// Leonard: Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.// Sheldon: Then why did you say it.// Leonard: I don’t know, I wasn’t choosing my…// Sheldon: Were you trying to impress Penny?// Leonard: No, no not at all. A little bit.// Sheldon: How’d that work out for you?// Penny (entering): Leonard, ready to go?// Sheldon: Libido 1, truth zero.// Leonard: Okay, I’m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.// Sheldon: And I’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified and bite me.// Leonard: Let’s go.// Penny: Bye Sheldon.// Sheldon: Goodbye Penny. (Places fingers to head to try to make Leonard’s brain explode. Leonard leaves.) Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!// Scene: A corridor at the conference. Penny is attaching Leonard’s name tag.// Penny: There you go.// Leonard: You’re right, this side does look better.// Penny: No, no, I didn’t say better, I said less stained.// Howard: I just checked the house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.// Leonard: You’re kidding.// Penny: Is that all?// Leonard: All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.// Penny: Oh, well, then good!// Leonard: I wasn’t expecting such a crowd, I’m a little nervous.// Howard: It’s okay, just open with a joke, you’ll be fine.// Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum. (Raj and Howard laugh.) Right?// Penny: Oh, sorry, I’ve just, I’ve heard it before.// Howard: Let’s roll. Hey, nice suit.// Leonard: It’s a classic, right?// Penny: I really should have brought my own car.// Scene: Leonard is presenting.// Leonard: So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. (Applause) Thank you. (Penny is asleep on Howard’s shoulder. Howard is taking a photograph with his camera phone.) Are there any questions?// Voice: Yeah. What the hell was that?// Leonard: Any other questions?// Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses): Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper. (No reaction.) Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.// Leonard: I didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. It’s not science.// Sheldon: Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?// Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.// Sheldon: No, no that’s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.// Leonard: You cannot possibly be that arrogant.// Sheldon: You continue to underestimate me, my good man.// Leonard: Look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.// Sheldon: As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don’t need validation from lesser minds. No offence.// Leonard: Really, so why did you come?// Sheldon: Because I knew you’d screw this up.// Leonard: I didn’t screw it up.// Sheldon: Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.// Leonard: I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.// Sheldon: So you admit that you’re an egotist?// Leonard: Yes. (To audience) My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he’s worse.// Sheldon: Okay, that is it. (Tries to explode brain again.)// Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your mind.// Sheldon: Then I’ll settle for an aneurysm.// Leonard (knocking his hands down): Stop it.// Sheldon: You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.// Leonard: You were trying to blow up my head.// Sheldon: So it was working.// Leonard: It wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase.// Sheldon: Oh we’ll see about that (tries again), heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.// Leonard: Stop, stop it, quit it. (The start to fight.)// Penny: Is this usually how these physics things go?// Howard: More often than you’d think.// Leonard (getting Sheldon on floor): Vulcan nerve pinch!// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: You could have offered me a ride home.// Leonard: You’re lucky I didn’t run you over.// Sheldon: I really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there’s just no pleasing you.// Leonard: You’re right, I’m the problem, I’m the one that needs help.// Sheldon: Well that’s not much of an apology, but I’ll take it.// Leonard: Excuse me. Is there anything you’d like to apologise for?// Sheldon: Yes. I’m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.// Howard (entering with Raj): You won’t believe this.// Raj: Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: Now, who would do that?// Howard: That would be me. Hey, check it out, it’s a featured video. (The watch).// Leonard: Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?// Sheldon: Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I’m like a flamingo on Ritalin.// Penny (entering): Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “Me and my Girlfriend?”// Howard: Uh-oh, here comes “the talk.”// Penny tries to make Howard’s brain explode.// Scene: Captioned “Somewhere in China”, two Chinese students watch the video on their computer.// Student one (in captions): What losers.// Student two: Yeah. Gigantic American geeks. (The lights flicker)// Student one: Who’s doing that?// Student two: Someone from Pasadena, California named… “Wolowizard.”// Together: Awesome!Series 01 Episode 10 – The Loobenfeld Decay// Scene: The downstairs lobby.// Leonard: See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson’s death in Terminator 2.// Sheldon: Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?// Leonard: Skynet is kinky? I don’t know.// Sheldon: Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.// Leonard: Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…// Sheldon: (Buzzing noise), too late, I win.// Penny (voice off, singing, quite tunelessly): Let’s go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.// Leonard: What the hell is that?// Sheldon: I don’t know, but if cats could sing, they’d hate it too. (The continue up the stairs and disappear from view).// Penny (still singing off): You wanna prowl, be my night owl, (Leonard and Sheldon reappear, running down the stairs) we’ll take my… (appearing) Hey guys, hi! Where you going?// Leonard: What? Oh we just had to… mail some letters and (seeing Sheldon has large bag in hand and bin is nearby) throw away some chicken. (Sheldon very reluctantly does.)// Penny: You’ll never guess what just happened.// Leonard: Oh, I give up.// Sheldon: I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.// Penny: What was that?// Leonard: Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?// Penny: Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn’t get it and I couldn’t figure out why?// Sheldon: I have a conclusion based on an observation.// Leonard: No you don’t. No he doesn’t.// Penny: Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.// Leonard: Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.// Penny: It’s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.// Sheldon: I think I know.// Leonard: No you don’t. He doesn’t.// Penny: It’s this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?// Together: No.// Leonard: Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.// Sheldon: I think that’s a week from Tuesday at six.// Leonard: No, it’s this Friday, at eight.// Penny: Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.// Leonard: See you. (Penny exits singing)// Sheldon: You just lied to Penny.// Leonard: Yes, I did.// Sheldon: And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.// Leonard: So?// Sheldon: So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.// Leonard: Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.// Sheldon: No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago.// Leonard: That’s very true.// Leonard exits. Sheldon looks worried for a moment, then retrieves the chicken from the bin and follows.// Credits sequence// Scene: Outside Leonard’s bedroom.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard…// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: I need to speak to you.// Leonard: It’s two o’clock in the morning// Sheldon: It’s important.// Leonard: I highly doubt that. Go away. (Long pause). Are you still out there?// Sheldon: Yes.// Leonard (opening door): What?// Sheldon: You’re right, it can wait until morning.// Leonard (following Sheldon into living room): What, what, what, what, what?// Sheldon: Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you’re in no state to talk.// Leonard: Sheldon, what is it?// Sheldon: I’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.// Leonard: What was I supposed to say.// Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.// Leonard: That would have hurt her feelings.// Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.// Leonard: And what would I have said afterwards?// Sheldon: I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I’d recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.// Leonard: I couldn’t say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can’t wait to hear you sing again.// Sheldon: Why?// Leonard: It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at.// Sheldon: I was not aware of that.// Leonard: Well now you are.// Sheldon: Oh, alright. Leonard.// Sheldon: When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can’t wait to play you again. Goodnight.// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock)…..// Leonard: Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath. (Opening door) What?// Sheldon: I was analysing our lie, and I believe we’re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.// Leonard: How?// Sheldon: Simple. If she were to log on to// www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other// , click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.// Leonard closes door.// Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.// Scene: Outside Penny’s door.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (door opens) Good morning.// Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?// Sheldon: Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It’s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.// Penny: What do you want?// Sheldon: Remember how Leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?// Penny: I remember symposium.// Sheldon: Yes, well, he lied.// Penny: Wait, what?// Sheldon: He lied, and I’m feeling very uncomfortable about it.// Penny: Well imagine how I’m feeling.// Sheldon: Hungry? Tired? I’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit.// Scene: The living room.// Leonard: You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?// Sheldon: To help you.// Leonard: I’m sorry, I’m not seeing the help.// Sheldon: She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.// Leonard: Oh, I’m getting a bad feeling.// Sheldon: Hunger? Indigestion, I’m sorry I’m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin Leopold’s drug intervention.// Leonard: Your cousin Leopold?// Sheldon: Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it’s important.// Leonard: What’s important?// Sheldon: Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.// Leonard: Do you have a cousin Leopold.// Sheldon: No, I made him up. I think you’d call him Lee.// Leonard: I don’t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?// Sheldon: Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.// Leonard: Un-unravelable?// Sheldon: Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.// Leonard: Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.// Sheldon: Ah, because it’s in Long Beach, and I don’t drive.// Leonard: We’re going to Long Beach?// Sheldon: No, of course not, there’s no cousin Leo, there’s no intervention, focus Leonard.// Leonard: Oh, come on!// Sheldon: We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.// Leonard: So he goes back into rehab?// Sheldon: Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.// Leonard: You still told her I lied.// Sheldon: For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?// Leonard: I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.// Sheldon: That’s the best part, you don’t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.// Leonard: So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?// Sheldon: Un-unravelable.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard (opening door): Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.// Penny: Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.// Leonard: Oh, well, thankyou.// Penny: You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that’s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to.// Leonard: I don’t know what to say.// Penny: It’s okay, Leonard (hugs him.)// Leonard: Oh, okay, alright, good.// Howard (arriving): Oh boy, group hug.// Penny: Uh-huh!// Howard: Uh-huh?// Howard: Okay. So what’s up?// Sheldon: Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.// Howard: Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you’re Bogarding the symposium.// Leonard: Howard, I’m sorry… we’re… we’re// Howard: No, no, you’re quark-blocking us.// Howard: Wow.// Leonard: Howard, listen…// Howard: No, it’s okay, it’s your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.// Penny: Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.// Sheldon: Okay, sure. I don’t see a problem with that.// Penny: There’s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn’t that right Leonard.// Leonard: Well… I don’t know what to say.// Penny: It’s okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian// Sheldon: Good for you.// Penny: Hah, yeah! Because he didn’t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.// Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): No, I’m lost too, I think she skipped a step.// Penny: No, look, Sheldon’s cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he’s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family’s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man.// Leonard: Oh, another hug, thank you.// Penny: Alright you guys, good luck.// Leonard: Thanks Penny.// Howard: Yeah, uh, break a leg.// Sheldon: Break a leg. (She leaves)// Howard: So, road trip to Long Beach.// Leonard: No, we’re not going to Long Beach.// Raj: Why not?// Leonard: Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.// Raj: Oh, too bad. I’ve always wanted to go to Long Beach.// Sheldon: It’s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.// Raj: Sounds fun.// Howard: I’m game.// Raj: Shotgun.// Sheldon: No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy.// Leonard: Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.//  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard…// Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.// Sheldon: No, that’s the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie.// Leonard: What are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over.// Sheldon: Sadly, it’s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.// Leonard: Why not?// Sheldon: Because Leo is a middle child.// Leonard: There is no Leo, how can you say that?// Sheldon: You didn’t read the bio, did you? He’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.// Leonard: I’ve got a solution.// Sheldon: Great, what is it?// Leonard: Get out.// Sheldon: Fine. (He leaves. A moment later he comes back.) I’ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I’m just trying to clean up after your mess. (Leonard throws a glass ornament at him. He just manages to shut the door in time.) We’ll talk in the morning.// Scene: The living room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown. There is a strange man eating cereal at the kitchen table.// Strange man: Morning.// Leonard: Who are you?// Man: I am Sheldon’s cousin Leo.// Leonard: Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.// Man: Au contraire. I’m 26 years old, I’m originally from (reads off crib notes) Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I’ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.// Sheldon: Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.// Man: Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.// Sheldon: For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.// Leonard: Sheldon?// Sheldon: I’m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.// Toby: It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.// Leonard: Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?// Sheldon: Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.// Leonard: Oh…!// Toby: Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.// Sheldon: No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.// Toby: Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?// Sheldon: Subtextually, of course. (There is a knock on the door.) Just have fun with it. (Opening door.) Morning Penny.// Penny: Hi. How did the intervention go.// Sheldon: Unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab.// Penny: Well, based on what you told me, I’m not surprised.// Sheldon: But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.// Penny: Hi Leo, how are you feeling?// Toby: Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?// Penny: No.// Toby: Then don’t ask me how I’m feeling.// Leonard: Well, that’s Leo. Hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?// Penny: Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.// Leonard: There were only two people there?// Penny: By the end. Yeah.// Toby: Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!// Penny: I’m… I’m sorry.// Toby: The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.// Sheldon: Don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.// Toby: That’s never been proven.// Sheldon: There have been studies.// Toby: Not double blind studies.// Sheldon: How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.// Leonard: As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy.// Penny: Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?// Leonard: Sounds good.// Penny: I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?// Leonard: Gee, why wouldn’t I?// Penny: This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.// Leonard: Yeah! Funny how things work out.// Toby: And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.// Sheldon: Your parents made the right decision.// Toby: I cannot work like this!// Scene: The apartment. Penny is on the sofa with Toby. They are watching TV.// Toby: This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or… or… wondering if you’re a dude down there.// Penny: Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You’re gonna do okay.// Toby: One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.// Leonard: How long is he going to stay here.// Sheldon: He’s a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.Series 01 Episode 11 – The Pancake Batter Anomaly// Scene: The living room of the apartment. Leonard and Sheldon are playing the three dimensional chess game from the original Star Trek series. It is Leonard’s move. He takes his time, moving round the board and checking things from various angles. Finally he tentatively makes a move. Sheldon moves almost immediately.// Sheldon: Checkmate.// Leonard: O-o-o-o-h! Again?// Sheldon: Obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.// Leonard: Just reset the board.// Sheldon: It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.// Penny (knocking and entering): Hi guys.// Leonard: Hey!// Penny: Did you get my mail.// Leonard: Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?// Penny: Oh, better than North Dakota! (Pause) I guess that joke’s only funny in Nebraska.// Sheldon: From the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.// Penny: Boy, it’s good to be back.// Leonard: How was your family?// Penny: Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.// Sheldon: Sick?// Leonard: Here we go.// Sheldon (running to opposite side of the room): What kind of sick?// Penny: Oh, the flu I guess.// Sheldon: I don’t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?// Penny: Maybe Friday.// Sheldon: Friday, was that morning or afternoon?// Penny: I… I don’t…// Sheldon: Think woman, who blew their nose and when?// Leonard: Sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, I’m sure she’s not contagious.// Sheldon: Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.// Leonard: Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe.// Penny: Oh, it’s okay, I understand.// Sheldon: Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.// Leonard: You’d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.// Penny: Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.// Leonard: No problem. Welcome home. (Sees Penny out. Turns to find Sheldon spraying the air with Lysol.)// Sheldon: What?// Credits sequence// Scene: The kitchen// Leonard: What the hell are you doing?// Sheldon: I’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.// Leonard: With lime jello?// Sheldon: I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.// Leonard: I don’t think so.// Sheldon: Leonard! If I’m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what’s growing in my throat.// Leonard: Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.// Sheldon: We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.// Leonard: Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting?// Sheldon: When I’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.// Leonard: I’m going back to bed.// Sheldon: Wait. (Handing him a measuring jug) Put this in the bathroom.// Leonard: What for?// Sheldon: I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.// Leonard: I mix pancake batter in this!// Sheldon: No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.// Leonard: You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?// Sheldon: It’s right here on the bottom.// Leonard: Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon wakes up and coughs. Picks up an electronic thermometer and takes his temperature.// Sheldon: Oh, dear God. (Shouting) Leonard! Leonard, I’m sick!// Cut to Leonard entering living room in panic, stumbling and trying to put on a pair of trousers.// Sheldon (voice off): Leonard! Leonard I’m sick!// Leonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.// Sheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard? (Bends to get phone) Ow!// Leonard (voice on phone): Hey.// Sheldon: Leonard, where are you?// Leonard (running down stairs): I’m at work.// Sheldon: At six-thirty in the morning?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: On Sunday?// Sheldon: Why?// Leonard: They asked me to come in.// Sheldon: Well, I didn’t hear the phone ring.// Leonard: They texted me.// Sheldon: Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.// Leonard: No kidding?// Sheldon: No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.// Leonard: Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.// Sheldon: What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?// Leonard: Drink whatever you want.// Sheldon: I want soup.// Leonard: Then make soup.// Sheldon: We don’t have soup.// Leonard: I’m at work, Sheldon. (A woman enters the apartment building with a barking dog.)// Sheldon: Is that a dog?// Leonard: Yes,// Sheldon: In the lab?// Leonard: Yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.// Scene: Howard’s bedroom. The phone is ringing.// Howard’s Mother (voice): Howard, it’s the phone.// Howard: I know it’s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.// Howard’s Mother: Well who’s calling at this ungodly hour?// Howard: I don’t know.// Howard’s Mother: Well ask them why they’re calling at this ungodly hour.// Howard: How can I ask them when I’m talking to you! (Into phone) Hello.// Leonard: Howard, it’s Leonard, code Milky Green.// Howard: Dear Lord, not Milky Green!// Leonard: Affirmative, with fever.// Howard’s Mother: Who’s on the phone.// Howard: It’s Leonard.// Howard’s Mother: Why is he calling.// Howard: Sheldon’s sick.// Howard’s Mother: Were you playing with him?// Howard: For God’s sake, Ma, I’m twenty six years old.// Howard’s Mother: Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.// Howard: Chocolate milk and eggoes please!// Leonard: Howard, listen to me.// Howard: Hang on, call waiting.// Leonard (voice): No, don’t, don’t….// Howard: Hello.// Sheldon: Howard, I’m sick.// Howard (imitating his mother’s voice): Howard’s sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?// Sheldon: I need soup.// Howard: Then call your own mother. (To Leonard) It was Sheldon.// Leonard: I tried to stop you.// Howard: It’s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ’06.// Leonard: You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.// Howard: Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?// Howard’s Mother: I just had the carpets steamed.// Howard: That’s a negatory. But there’s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.// Leonard: Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start.// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.// Waitress: Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.// Penny: No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?// Sheldon: I’m sick, thank you very much.// Penny: How could you have gotten it from me, I’m not sick.// Sheldon: You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You’re doomed!// Penny: Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.// Penny (over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance): Why didn’t you just…. (louder throat clearance) Why didn’t you just have soup at home.// Sheldon: Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?// Penny: You can have soup delivered.// Sheldon: I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.// Penny: Okay, what kind of soup do you want.// Sheldon: Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.// Penny: We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.// Sheldon: Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?// Penny: No.// Sheldon: Then surprise me. (Blows nose into handkerchief. Shows it to next table) Would you call that moss green or forest green?// Scene: The cinema. Everyone is wearing ape masks.// Howard: Look at this, everyone went chimp.// Raj: Well I’d like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. (Phone rings).// Leonard: Oh, hi Penny!// Penny: Hey, where are you?// Leonard: I’m… uh… at work.// Penny: You sound funny.// Leonard: I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s up?// Penny: Yeah, well I’m at work too, and you’ll never guess who’s here infecting my entire station.// Leonard (To Howard and Raj): Sheldon’s at the Cheesecake Factory. (Into phone) Just tell him to go home.// Penny: He won’t leave, he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.// Leonard (To Howard and Raj): He’s paranoid, and he’s established a nest.// Penny: Can you please come get him?// Leonard: Uh, yeah, I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny. (Holds phone up, Howard makes warning siren noises) Oh my God there’s a breech in the radiation unit (Raj joins in) The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye! (To Howard and Raj) I feel really guilty.// Raj: You did what you had to do. (Steals some of Howard’s popcorn)// Howard: Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: Thanks for bringing me home.// Penny: Oh, it’s okay, I didn’t really need to work today, it’s not like I have rent or car payments or anything.// Sheldon: Good. Good.// Penny: Okay, well, you feel better.// Sheldon: Wait, where are you going?// Penny: Um, home, to write some bad cheques.// Sheldon: You’re going to leave me?// Penny: Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven’t you ever been sick before?// Sheldon: Well, of course, but, not by myself.// Penny: Really, never?// Sheldon: Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.// Penny: Studying abroad?// Sheldon: No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.// Penny: And there was no-one there to take care of you?// Sheldon: No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.// Penny: Again?// Sheldon: It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “// ?”// Penny: What does that mean?// Sheldon: Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”// Penny: Okay, sweetie, I’ll take care of you, what do you need?// Sheldon: Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.// Penny: Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.// Sheldon: Agreed.// Scene: The cinema.// Raj: Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.// Leonard: Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I’m blind here guys, can you help me find them?// Howard: Sorry. (Crunching sound) Found ‘em.// Leonard: Oh great.// Howard: Sorry, don’t you have a spare.// Leonard: Yeah, at home.// Raj: Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.// Howard: Unless Sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.// Leonard (Dials phone): Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. (To Howard) He’s home, I’m screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.// Raj: How about Lasic?// Leonard: You want me to get eye surgery?// Raj: Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?// Howard: Well?// Leonard: I’m thinking!// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Penny: Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I’ll see you later.// Sheldon: Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.// Penny: Oh, Sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?// Sheldon: Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.// Penny: But Sheldon….// Sheldon: Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.// Penny: I can’t believe I’m doing this.// Sheldon: No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.// Penny: Sorry.// Sheldon: Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.// Penny: What?// Sheldon: My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.// Penny: I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know it.// Sheldon: I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you.// Penny (after a loud sigh): Soft kitty, warm kitty…// Sheldon: Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.// Penny (through gritted teeth): Little ball of fur.// Scene: The living room door, a fibre-optic camera emerges from underneath. We see the scene from its point of view. Cut to outside. Raj is holding a laptop, Howard is feeding the camera under the door.// Leonard: What do you see, what do you see.// Raj: The living room appears to be empty.// Leonard: Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.// Howard: I’m not going in there.// Leonard: Raj?// Raj: No way, Jose.// Leonard: Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything.// Howard: It’s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We’ll be your eyes.// Leonard: Fine.// Howard: One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.// Leonard: Won’t my footsteps set it off?// Howard: No, you’ll be on your hands and knees. Now you’ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon’s room.// Leonard: Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?// Cut to Leonard entering apartment on hands and knees, carrying the sensor in his teeth.// Howard: Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.// Leonard: What?// Howard: It means go straight.// Leonard: Then just say go straight.// Howard: You don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings, you say keep true.// Leonard: Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.) I just hit my head.// Howard: Because you didn’t keep true. (Time shift, Leonard is now outside bedrooms) Okay, turn right.// Raj: The… the picture’s breaking up.// Howard: Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more. (Leonard now has his head at right angles to his body) That’s it, now just keep true. Alright, you’re close enough to Sheldon’s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.// Leonard: It wasn’t on?// Howard: No.// Leonard: Then why did I have to crawl?// Howard: Oh, I guess you didn’t.// Leonard: Okay, it’s on.// Howard: Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.// Leonard: I know.// Howard: Hang on, the sensor’s picking up something, turn your head back. (Camera angle shows a pair of female legs.)// Penny: You rat bastard.// Howard (running down stairs with Raj): Told you the sensor would work.// Leonard: Hi!// Penny: You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.// Leonard: Well, I had to, you see what he’s like.// Sheldon (off): Penny! Penny, I’m hungry.// Penny: Uh, it’s okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard’s home!// Leonard: No!// Penny (handing him vaporub): Here you go, good luck, bye.// Leonard: W-wait!// Sheldon: Leonard, I’m hungry!// Leonard: Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor. Sheldon appears in his comforter.)// Sheldon: I want grilled cheese.// Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are on the sofa. Sheldon is wrapped in his comforter, Leonard is holding an ice-pack to his head.// Sheldon: Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?// Leonard: I don’t think Penny’s ever coming here again.// Sheldon: I’m very congested.// Leonard: Yeah, so?// Sheldon: Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.// Leonard: If I stand, I’ll vomit.// Sheldon: Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.Series 01 Episode 12 – The Jerusalem Duality// Scene: The University cafeteria.// Sheldon: Here’s the problem with teleportation.// Leonard: Lay it on me.// Sheldon: Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.// Leonard: How about that.// Sheldon: Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.// Leonard: Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?// Sheldon: No, he would be exactly the same.// Leonard: That is a problem.// Sheldon: So, you see it too.// Dr Gablehouser (arriving): Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.// Together: Dr Gablehouser.// Gablehouser: Gentlemen, I’d like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we’re hoping to have him do his graduate work here.// Leonard: Graduate work, very impressive.// Gablehouser: And he’s only fifteen years old.// Sheldon: Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.// Dennis: Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea.// Leonard: Advantage Kim.// Gablehouser: I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we’re the best physics research facility in the country.// Dennis: I already know you’re not. You don’t have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.// Sheldon: Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.// Dennis: Well, obviously you don’t see it yet, but trust me, you will.// Gablehouser: Dennis, we discussed this, we’re in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we’ve agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.// Leonard: Yes sir.// Sheldon: You can count on us, we’re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.// Dennis: I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk.// Sheldon: I sense a disturbance in the force.// Leonard (in a Yoda voice): A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.// Credits sequence// Scene: A corridor.// Leonard: So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.// Dennis: A year and a half.// Leonard: No kidding, you speak English really well.// Dennis: So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.// Leonard: What are you talking about?// Dennis: That.// Sheldon: He’s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.// Dennis: Is this part of the tour?// Sheldon: Nope. Goodbye.// Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything.// Sheldon: Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.// Dennis: Looks like you’re doing work in quantum loop corrections.// Sheldon: Keen observation, goodbye.// Dennis: You see where you went wrong, don’t you?// Sheldon: Leonard.// Leonard: Huh, yeah?// Sheldon: Get him out.// Leonard: Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment.// Dennis: Do I look like I lift weights.// Leonard: Not heavy ones.// Dennis: It’s startling to me you haven’t considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.// Sheldon: You think I haven’t considered it? You really think I haven’t considered it?// Dennis: Have you considered it?// Sheldon: Get him out Leonard.// Leonard: Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab.// Dennis: Wow, you won the Stephenson award.// Sheldon: Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.// Dennis: Really, how old?// Sheldon: Fourteen and a half.// Dennis: You were the youngest person ever to win it.// Leonard: It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it?// Scene: The living room of the apartment.// Penny (to Raj): Mmm, this is really delicious, isn’t it? (Raj looks uncomfortable, then nods.) Still can’t talk to me unless you’re drunk, huh? (Shakes head) Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.// Howard: Hey, I’m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?// Penny: Sure. Raj, hug Howard.// Sheldon (dramatically): Uh-uh-uh.// Leonard: Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.// Sheldon: Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he’s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know, that other guy.// Howard: Antonio Salieri?// Sheldon: Oh, God, now even you’re smarter than me.// Howard: You know, Sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.// Leonard: Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better.// Sheldon: Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.// Penny: I’m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?// Leonard: You can’t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.// Sheldon: Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.// Penny: So, you’ve got a bit of competition, I really don’t see what the big deal is.// Sheldon: Well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything.// Penny: I don’t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?// Howard: We liked Leonard.// Leonard: Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?// Sheldon: Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.// Penny: You know, I’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?// Scene: The same, later that night// Sheldon: Hey.// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: I’ve decided you’re right. My career is not over.// Leonard: Great.// Sheldon: But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.// Sheldon: So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you.// Sheldon: What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I’ve never really paid attention.// Leonard: Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don’t need any help.// Sheldon: Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?// Leonard: It would blow up.// Sheldon: Are you sure?// Leonard: Pretty sure.// Sheldon: Pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?// Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.// Sheldon: Alright.// Leonard: Go away.// Sheldon: If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… I’m going.// Scene: Howard’s lab.// Howard (into phone): It’s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I’m looking at it right now. (Pause.) Why would I make that up, there’s no ding-dong in it. (Pause.) How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?// Sheldon (entering): So, this is engineering, huh?// Howard (into phone): I’ll talk to you later.// Sheldon: Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.// Howard: Sheldon, what are you doing here?// Sheldon: I just came by to say hello.// Howard: I’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never came by to say hello.// Sheldon: Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?// Howard: A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle.// Sheldon: Really, how does it work?// Howard: When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.// Sheldon: Uh, huh. So it’s a shelf?// Howard: No, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf.// Sheldon: Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.// Howard: Sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.// Sheldon: And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.// Howard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Yes.// Howard: Go away.// Sheldon: Did Leonard tell you to say that?// Howard: No, I thought of it all by myself.// Sheldon: Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I’m missing.// Scene: Raj is exiting his office.// Raj: Go away. (Sheldon exits)// Sheldon: Curiouser and curiouser.// Scene: The apartment.// Howard (entering): Is he here?// Leonard: If he were, I wouldn’t be.// Raj: Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.// Leonard: Is that even possible?// Raj: As it turns out, yes.// Howard: Something’s got to be done about him, Leonard.// Leonard: Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.// Raj: Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?// Howard: Then our problem would be solved.// Leonard: Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m not saying no.// Howard: We don’t have to go that far, there are other means available.// Raj: We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.// Howard: The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.// Leonard: That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics.// Howard: What about biology?// Leonard: What?// Howard: You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.// Leonard: Howard, he’s fifteen.// Howard: Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.// Raj: She was sleeping with you?// Howard: No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.// Sheldon (entering): Oh, good, you’re all here. Look, I’ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. (They stare at him.) Go away? (They nod) Hmm. Could it be me?// Scene: Outside Penny’s apartment.// Penny (opening door): Oh, hey guys, what’s up?// Howard: We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.// Penny: What?// Leonard: Howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. (Penny slams door.)// Raj: It’s possible she may have misunderstood us.// Scene: Sheldon’s office. He is making measurements on maps. There is a knock on the door.// Gablehouser (entering): Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?// Sheldon: No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you’ll appreciate this, very exciting.// Gablehouser: Oh, what are you working on?// Sheldon: Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I’m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.// Gablehouser: To what end?// Sheldon: You know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.// Gablehouser: Who will come?// Sheldon: The Jewish people.// Gablehouser: What if they don’t come.// Sheldon: We’ll make it nice, put out a spread.// Gablehouser: Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we’re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who’s agreed to join us here at the University.// Sheldon: Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can’t you.// Gablehouser: Okay, well, uh, obviously you’re very busy with your… uh, um, come Dennis. You’ll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he’s been under a lot of… um… he’s nuts.// Sheldon (voice off, sings to a Mexican tune): Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They’ll come, they’ll settle and I’ll win the prize…// Scene: The welcoming party// Sheldon: I really don’t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn’t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?// Goldfarb: Go away.// Sheldon: We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.// Goldfarb: Please go away.// Sheldon: Said Pharoah to Moses.// Gablehouser: Why are all these young women here?// Leonard: It’s take your daughter to work day.// Gablehouser: Really, I was not aware of that.// Raj: Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.// Gablehouser: Hm?// Howard: Smooth.// Raj: Thank you.// Gablehouser: There’s the man of the hour.// Leonard: Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.// Howard: All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. (The look at Dennis, who is picking his ear.)// Leonard: Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?// Raj: We need a social catalyst.// Leonard: Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk. // Howard: Or can we?// Leonard: No, we can’t.// Howard: I don’t think you mean we can’t. I think you mean we shouldn’t.// Sheldon: Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me.// Leonard: Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.// Raj: Okay. How about that one.// Howard: Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.// Raj: Are you crying?// Howard: No, I have allergies.// Raj: Okay, uh, how about her?// Leonard: Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you.// Raj: Okay, so not her either. How about her?// Howard: Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.// Leonard: I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.// Raj: I can’t talk to her, you do it.// Leonard: I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.// Howard: Oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.// Raj: You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done.// Leonard: Well, we’re not in India.// Raj: Alright, why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.// Leonard: Okay, that was uncalled for.// Raj: You started it, dude.// Gablehouser: Could I have everyone’s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We’re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.// Sheldon (sarcastically): Welcome Dennis Kim.// Gablehouser: Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.// Sheldon: Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!// Gablehouser: And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!// Dennis: What?// Gablehouser: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.// Dennis: Um, no thanks. I’m going to the mall with Emma.// Gablehouser: Well, uh, well, uh….// Leonard: The kid got a girl.// Raj: Unbelievable.// Howard: Did anyone see how he did it?// Sheldon (to Gablehouser): Don’t worry, I’ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.// Howard: He’s back.// Leonard: Yeah, mission accomplished.// Raj: Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?// Howard: I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.// Leonard: Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart.// Raj: Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.// Howard: Yeah, let’s go with that.// Scene: The park. The four guys are carrying remote control rockets.// Howard: Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.// Leonard: I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”// Raj: Hey, look at that. (There is a group of youngsters on the grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag.) It’s Dennis Kim.// Howard: Wow, I almost didn’t recognise him.// Raj: You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. (Dennis is now snogging the face off Emma)// Leonard: Yeah, we really ruined his life.// Sheldon: Screw him, he was weak.Series 01 Episode 13 – The Bat Jar Conjecture// Scene: The apartment. Howard is looking at his mobile phone.// Howard: Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There’s going to be a scene depicting Spock’s birth.// Raj: I’d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock’s conception.// Sheldon: Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it’s an extremely private matter.// Leonard: Still, I’d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive.// Howard: Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock’s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.// Raj: How come on Star Trek everybody’s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.// Penny (entering): Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it’s just going “aaaaaaa”.// Leonard: What did you spill on it?// Penny: Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.// Leonard: I’ll take a look at it.// Howard: Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren’t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year.// Leonard: You’re kidding, why not?// Howard: They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm.// Penny: Wow, so in your world, you’re like, the cool guys.// Howard: Recognise.// Leonard: This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.// Penny: Zod?// Howard: Kryptonian villain. Long story.// Raj: Good story. (Clasps hands to mouth in shock.)// Sheldon: Well count me out.// Howard: What? Why?// Sheldon: You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?// Leonard: Come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people.// Sheldon: By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.// Penny: I want tickets to that please.// Leonard: Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock’s dying words to you.// Sheldon: No, don’t.// Leonard: The needs of the many.// Howard: Outweigh the needs of the few.// Sheldon: Or the one. Dammit, I’ll do it.// Credits sequence// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.// Howard: How about the perpetual motion squad? It’s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies.// Leonard: The ladies?// Howard: Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.// Raj: I like it.// Sheldon: I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.// Raj: Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.// Sheldon: Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.// Raj: Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.// Leonard: Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….// Sheldon: Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.// Leonard: Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?// Sheldon: I will yield.// Leonard: After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?// Sheldon: He does.// Leonard: I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny, and I’ll be your host, because apparently I didn’t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: Of course.// Howard: Fire away. (Raj puts his thumb up.)// Penny: You know, it’s none of my business, but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?// Leonard: Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice.// Penny: Oh, thanks Raj, it’s vanilla oil.// Leonard: I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start.// Penny: Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.// Sheldon: And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.// Penny: That is correct.// Leonard: I knew that too.// Penny: Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.// Sheldon: And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.// Penny: Right.// Howard: Hey, I buzzed in.// Sheldon: But I answered, it’s called teamwork.// Howard: Don’t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.// Sheldon: By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I’m a mammal. // Leonard: Just ask another one.// Penny: Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? (Raj buzzes.)// Sheldon: And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.// Leonard: Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.// Sheldon: Why?// Penny: Because it’s polite.// Sheldon: What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?// Penny: Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.// Sheldon: The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn’t I give them?// Howard: Some of us might have the correct answers too.// Sheldon: Oh please, you don’t even have a PhD.// Howard: Alright, that’s it.// Leonard: Howard, sit down.// Howard: Okay.// Leonard: maybe we should take a little break.// Sheldon: Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.// Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): I agree.// Penny: What did he say?// Howard: He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve.// Penny: Yeah, and the bag it came in.// Scene: The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.// Sheldon: Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.// Leonard: Can it wait, I need to talk to you.// Sheldon: Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold.// Leonard: Why do they say AA?// Sheldon: Army Ants.// Leonard: Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.// Sheldon: Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?// Leonard: No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!// Sheldon: Oh neat, what’s the occasion?// Leonard: Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team.// Sheldon: What?// Leonard: Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.// Sheldon: No you didn’t.// Leonard: Yes we did, I just came from it.// Sheldon: Okay, I don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because I’m on the team and I wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet.// Leonard: Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team.// Leonard: Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.// Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?// Leonard: Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.// Sheldon: I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.// Leonard: Thanks for the heads up.// Sheldon: You’re welcome. One more thing.// Sheldon: It’s on, bitch.// Howard: So who’d he get to be on his team.// Leonard: He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.// Raj: He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.// Leonard: How exactly would that laugh go?// Raj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!// Howard: That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.// Leonard: Guys, let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.// Howard: So?// Leonard: So nothing, let’s destroy him.// Sheldon (walking past): Gentlemen.// Howard: Okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team.// Raj: You know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.// Leonard: Raj, we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics bowl team.// Raj: How about the girl from the Wonder Years?// Howard: Gentlemen, I believe I’ve found the solution to all our problems.// Leonard: We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.// Raj: Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney?// Howard: Sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.// Raj: Yeah. Sack up, dude.// Leonard: Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.// Leslie: Hi guys.// Leonard: Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…// Howard: Hit that thang.// Leslie: Leonard, there’s no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we’ve seen each other’s faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.// Leonard: There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.// Leslie: Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.// Leonard: That’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, I’d like to get on with my question now.// Leslie: Proceed.// Leonard: We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.// Leslie: No thanks, I’m really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.// Howard: Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you.// Leslie: Sorry.// Howard: Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano.// Leslie: Wait, you’re going up against Sheldon Cooper?// Howard: Yes.// Leslie: That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?// Leonard: She’s in.// Scene: The Physics Bowl.// Penny: So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on? (The guys look confused.) Are you ready?// Leonard: Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing.// Penny: Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting.// Sheldon (entering in his Star Trek themed shirt): Gentlemen.// Leonard: Sheldon.// Howard: Sheldon.// Raj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.// Penny: Sheldon. I’m just going to sit down.// Leonard: So, is that your team.// Sheldon: Actually, I don’t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?// Leslie: Hello, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Leslie Winkle?// Leslie: Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?// Sheldon: Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.// Leslie: Oh, ouch.// Dr Gablehouser: Okay, if everyone could please take your seats.// Leonard: Here’s your tee-shirt. (Hands her a tee-shirt with PMS on it. Takes jacket off to reveal similar.)// Leslie: PMS? It’s a couple of days early, but…// Leonard: No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.// Leslie: Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?// Gablehouser: Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year’s physics bowl. Today’s preliminary match features two great teams… AA versus PMS.// Howard: All night long, y’all! (Stands and turns round to reveal the back of the tee-shirt which reads “We Can Go All Night”.)// Gablehouser: Okay, well let’s jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson? (Buzz) PMS?// Leonard: The Eta Meson.// Gablehouser: Correct.// Sheldon: Formal protest.// Gablehouser: On what grounds?// Sheldon: The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.// Gablehouser: Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope. (Buzz) AA?// Sheldon: And of course, the answer is Technetium.// Gablehouser: Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation. (Buzz) PMS?// Raj: Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.// (Time shift)// Gablehouser: How does a quantum computer factor large numbers. (Buzz) PMS?// Leslie: Shor’s Algorithm.// Sheldon: 4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.//  (Time shift)// Leonard: Prevost’s theory of exchanges.// Sheldon: Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N// Howard: 760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.// Gablehouser: Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning.// Sheldon: A sigma particle.// Leslie: Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.// Gablehouser: Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation.// Raj: Holy crap.// Leonard: What the hell is that.// Howard: It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.// Leonard: Come on, think, Leslie.// Leslie: Leonard, it’s not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.// Leonard: You’re never going to let that go, are you?// Gablehouser: Ten seconds. (Buzz) PMS.// Leonard: Sorry, I panicked.// Howard: Then guess.// Leonard: Um, eight. (Gablehouser stares at him.) Point four.// Gablehouser: I’m sorry, that’s incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours.// Howard: He doesn’t have it. He’s got squat.// (Sheldon looks more and more uncomfortable, so much he is involuntarily twitching.)// Gablehouser: AA, I need your answer. (Buzz)// Third Floor Janitor: The answer is minus eight by alpha.// Sheldon: Hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. What are you doing?// Third Floor Janitor: Answering question. Winning physics bowl.// Sheldon: How do you know anything about physics?// Third Floor Janitor: Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.// Sheldon: Well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.// Third Floor Janitor: You didn’t answer question.// Sheldon: Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. (Makes fist in the air). Ow!// Gablehouser: AA, I need your official answer.// Sheldon: Well it’s not what he said.// Gablehouser: Then what is it?// Sheldon: I want a different question.// Gablehouser: You can’t have a different question.// Gablehouser: Denied.// Sheldon: Informal protest.// Gablehouser: Denied. I need your official answer.// Sheldon: No. I decline to provide one.// Gablehouser: Well, that’s too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct.// Sheldon: That’s your opinion.// Gablehouser: Alright, the winner of the match is…// Leonard: Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.// Sheldon: I don’t understand the question.// Leonard: Go ahead.// Gablehouser: The winner is PMS!// (We Are The Champions by Queen plays as the team celebrate in slow motion and Sheldon puts his head in his hands. The celebration ends with Howard on his knees ripping his shirt in half and waving it round his head before throwing it to the audience.)// Scene: The apartment. Sheldon goes to sit in his spot.// Leonard: Sorry, somebody’s sitting there.// Sheldon: Who?// Leonard: My Physics Bowl Trophy!// Sheldon: That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win.// Leonard: I know someone who would disagree.// Leonard: My Physics Bowl Trophy! (In weird voice) “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”// Sheldon: Alright that is very immature.// Leonard: You’re right, I’m sorry. (In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon’s face) I’m not!// Penny (entering): Okay, new contest.// Leonard: What are you doing?// Penny: I’m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?// Sheldon: Absolutely.// Leonard: Bring it on.// Penny: Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family? (They stare at her.) The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?// Sheldon (after they look at each other in confusion): The Brady Bunch?// Penny: Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum. (Pause) Oh my God, Sean Penn!// Leonard: How do you know these things?// Penny: I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine’s sexiest man alive?// Sheldon: William Shatner.// Leonard: Wait, I don’t think it’s Shatner.// Sheldon: Then it’s got to be Patrick Stewart.// Penny: No.// Penny: Alright, singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.” (Sheldon starts involuntarily twitching again.) Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?// Sheldon (after they pass a smug look between each other): Romulan.// Penny: Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.// (Sheldon and Leonard do a victory hand slide.) Series 01 Episode 14 – The Nerdvana Annihilation// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.// Raj: What did they give you?// Sheldon: Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.// Leonard: I don’t believe it.// Sheldon: I know, it’s basic culinary science.// Leonard: Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.// Howard: A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?// Leonard: No, a time machine from Sophie’s Choice.// Raj: Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it’s rough.// Howard: Oh, that’s cool.// Leonard: Uh-huh.// Raj: It’s only $800?// Leonard: Yeah. And that’s my bid.// Sheldon: You bid $800.// Leonard: It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.// Sheldon: There’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.// Howard: Do you have $800?// Leonard: Not to blow on a miniature time machine.// Howard: Don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it’s called sniping.// Raj: Fifteen seconds.// Leonard: Come on, snipers.// Raj: Ten, nine, eight…// Leonard: Where are your snipers?// Raj: Five.// Leonard: Snipe.// Raj: Four.// Raj: Three.// Leonard: Snipe!// Raj: Two.// Leonard: SNIPE!// Raj: One.// Leonard: Aaaa-aw!// Raj: Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.// Howard: You lucky duck.// Sheldon: I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.// Leonard: Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it.// Howard: Why don’t we share it? We’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.// Raj: A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon?// Sheldon: Need you ask? But I still don’t understand why no-one else bid.// Scene: The lobby. The guys stand around a full sized time machine.// Sheldon: I understand why no-one else bid.// Credits sequence// Scene: The same// Raj: Did the listing actually say miniature?// Leonard: I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?// Sheldon: In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”.// Howard: It’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.// Raj: Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.// Leonard: How are we going to get it upstairs?// Howard: If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.// Leonard: Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.// Sheldon: I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?// Howard: Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away. (Presses lift button. Nothing happens.) No, that baby’s broken.// Scene: The stairwell, approaching the apartment door. Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the last part of the stairs.// Leonard: Come on, guys, push.// Howard (off): If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon.// Raj (off): I can’t feel my fingers, hurry up.// Sheldon: It’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.// Raj: Sheldon?// Sheldon: Yeah.// Raj: If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the middle one.// Penny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, hey guys.// Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon): Uh, hi Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys!// Penny: What are you doing?// Leonard: Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs.// Penny: What is it?// Leonard: It’s… you know, time machine.// Penny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….// Leonard: Uh, just give us a few minutes.// Penny: I don’t have a few minutes, I’m running really late.// Sheldon: Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.// Penny: You’re joking, right?// Sheldon: Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.// Penny: Damn, okay, I’ll just take the roof.// Leonard: Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind.// Sheldon: For what it’s worth, I thought it was humorous.// Leonard: Let’s just do this. Guys, ready to push?// Raj: In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.// Scene: The living room. The time machine is set up.// Sheldon: I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.// Leonard: Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.// Sheldon: The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.// Howard: Talk about your chick magnets.// Raj: Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!// Sheldon: Gentlemen, I know we said we’d take turns, but I think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here.// Howard: You can’t just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my friends house,” how lame is that?// Raj: He’s got a point.// Sheldon: Alright, I think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.// Leonard: Seconded.// Howard: I was going to put down a towel.// Raj: I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.// Leonard: That sounds fair.// Sheldon: Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?// Raj: Twice a month.// Sheldon: Then no.// Raj: Okay, every other month.// Sheldon: No.// Leonard: Sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the front illuminate. All let out an “oh”.) Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876.// Howard: Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.// Sheldon: Wait a minute, I’d want to see that too.// Leonard: So, when it’s your turn you can.// Sheldon: But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s up.// Raj: Also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 Pasadena.// Howard: And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?”// Raj: Mrs Bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock.// Sheldon: Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.// Raj: Ooh, how far into the future?// Sheldon: If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.// Leonard: Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future. (Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.) That was fun.// Raj: My turn.// Penny (entering): Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.// Leonard: Are you okay?// Penny: Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.// Leonard: That doesn’t sound too bad.// Penny: It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.// Leonard: Sorry.// Penny: Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that’s right, I’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…// Sheldon: Time machine.// Leonard: The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?// Penny: No! I don’t want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…// Sheldon: Again, time machine.// Penny: Oh please, it’s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.// Sheldon: It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.// Penny: Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. (Storms out. A beat, and then…)// Raj: My turn!// Scene: Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.// Sheldon: Leonard, it’s two in the morning.// Leonard: So?// Sheldon: So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?// Leonard: Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.// Sheldon: You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.// Leonard: Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?// Sheldon: Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.// Leonard: What if I knocked you unconscious right now?// Sheldon: It won’t change the past.// Leonard: But it would make the present so much nicer.// Sheldon: Are you upset about something?// Leonard: What was your first clue?// Sheldon: Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…// Leonard: Yes I’m upset.// Sheldon: Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.// Leonard: Yeah, good for you.// Sheldon: Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering you?// Leonard: I don’t know. Maybe.// Sheldon: Wow, I’m on fire tonight.// Leonard: Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.// Sheldon: I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.// Leonard: Thanks for pointing it out.// Sheldon: In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.// Leonard: Those are movies.// Sheldon: Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That’s absurd.// Scene: The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.// Leonard: Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine.// Leonard: No problem. (Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.) Hang on. (Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)// Penny: But, what about your time machine.// Leonard: Some things are more important than toys. (She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)// Penny: Oh, I’m scared.// Leonard: Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you.// Penny: Oh, Leonard. (Kisses him as they descend from view. Leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine.)// Sheldon: It’s still my turn.// Scene: The living room.// Sheldon: What are you doing?// Leonard: I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.// Sheldon: Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.// Leonard: It’s not about money.// Raj (entering): We brought food.// Howard: Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.// Leonard: Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?// Raj: Why?// Leonard: Because I don’t want it any more.// Howard: Why?// Leonard: Just… personal reasons.// Sheldon: My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.// Leonard: Look, do you want to buy me out or not?// Raj: I’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony.// Howard: Screw his balcony, I’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage.// Leonard: I paid two hundred dollars for my share.// Raj: Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.// Sheldon: I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.// Raj: Three hundred, and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.// Leonard: No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid of all of it.// Howard: You can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana.// Raj: More importantly, you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?// Leonard: Not for long.// Raj: Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.// Howard: Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.// Raj: Too bad, I called dibs.// Howard: Well you can’t just call dibs.// Raj: I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.// Sheldon: Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war.// Leonard: It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.// Raj: Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?// Howard: Will you forget dibs!// Leonard: He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.// Sheldon: What’s the number, I’ll match it.// Raj: I’ll match it, plus a thousand rupees.// Sheldon: What’s the exchange rate.// Raj: None of your business. Take it or leave it.// Howard (on phone): Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.// Leonard: Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.// Sheldon: Who cares, as long as you pick me.// Raj: Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let’s talk.// Leonard: Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.// Sheldon (moving to block his path): No. I can’t let you do this.// Leonard: Sheldon, get out of my way.// Sheldon (brandishing toy sword from Leonard’s box): None shall pass.// Leonard: Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.// Howard: Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here.// Penny (coming out of her flat): What the hell’s going on?// Sheldon: You hypocrite!// Penny: What?// Sheldon: Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!// Penny: Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.// Leonard: No, I needed to hear it.// Penny: No you didn’t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.// Howard: I guess that makes me large breasts.// Leonard: Still, I think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life.// Penny: Really?// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny: Oh. Wow. Good for you. (Kisses his cheek.)// Leonard: Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don’t know, later…// Good looking man coming up stairs: Excuse me. Hey, Penny!// Penny: Hi Mike.// Mike: Are you ready to go.// Penny: Yeah, I just have to change.// Mike: I’ll give you a hand.// Penny: Oh, stop it! Bye guys.// Leonard (after a long pause): My turn on the time machine.// Scene: A jungle. As the camera moves, the time machine becomes visible. Sheldon is sitting in it The disk stops spinning, and he looks around. The dials read APR 28 802,701.// Sheldon: It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked. (Large hairy creatures with glowing eyes emerge from the forest and walk towards him menacingly.) Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! (With a yelp, he wakes up in the time machine in the living room.)// Leonard: Sheldon, are you okay?// Sheldon: We have to get rid of the time machine.// Leonard: It is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?// Sheldon: Yeah, that’s the problem, it’s too big.// Leonard: I’m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. (A pair of Morlocks come through the door.)// Sheldon: Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. (Sheldon wakes up in his own bed.) Leonard!!!!!!!!Series 01 Episode 15 – The Porkchop Indeterminacy// Scene: A corridor at the University.// Leonard: On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it.// Raj: Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man.// Leonard (looking at an orange notice on the noticeboard): Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.// Raj: We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?// Leonard: I don’t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board. (Sees crowds in the corridor) What’s going on?// Howard: Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon’s office.// Leonard: Sheldon’s office? Is she lost?// Howard: Don’t think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.// Leonard: Maybe she’s his lawyer.// Howard: Well she’s free to examine my briefs.// Leonard: Howard…// Howard: I know, I’m disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again.// Girl: Well, that should do it.// Sheldon: Thank you for coming by. (He rises from his desk. Everyone rushes to look nonchalant.) Hello.// Leonard: Oh, hey buddy.// Sheldon: Buddy.// Howard: Sorry I’m late, I’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.// Sheldon: How can you be late, I wasn’t expecting you at all.// Howard: Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… BAM! (shakes girl’s hand) Howard Wolowitz.// Leonard: Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?// Sheldon: Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you’ve already met Howard.// Missy: It’s nice to meet you.// Leonard: You too, swell, also.// Howard: Yeah.// Leonard: So, how do you two know each other.// Missy: Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.// Leonard: Excuse me?// Sheldon: She’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly I’ve never been able to see it.// Missy: It’s because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.// Sheldon: How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?// Howard: Well, I think you’re delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole.// Missy: Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and… I’m sorry what was your name again. (Raj looks uncomfortable, turns and walks away, disappears round corner. He then reappears, takes the orange paper from the noticeboard and leaves again.)// Sheldon: Rajesh.// Credits sequence// Scene: The same.// Leonard: So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?// Howard: Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny.// Missy: My friend’s getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.// Howard: Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.// Missy: And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad’s estate.// Sheldon: The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she.// Missy: I guess that’s why they call you a genius.// Sheldon: They call me a genius because I’m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I’m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.// Leonard and Howard together: Woah, woah.// Leonard: If the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight?// Missy: Oh, I don’t think so. Shelly doesn’t like company. Even as a little boy he’d send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.// Sheldon: They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.// Leonard: Look, you’re here, we have plenty of room.// Sheldon: No we don’t.// Howard: Come on, Shelly, she’s family.// Sheldon: So what? I don’t issue invitations to your mother.// Missy: Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.// Sheldon: And don’t ever call me Shelly.// Leonard: So it’s settled. You’ll stay with us.// Howard: I’ll walk you to your car. You’re in structure 3 level C, right?// Sheldon: What just happened?// Scene: The apartment.// Missy: So anyway, we’re eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.// Leonard: Hee-hee, just classic.// Sheldon: I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.// Missy: He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.// Sheldon: Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.// Missy: Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there’s a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.// Howard: Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?// Missy: Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.// Sheldon: Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.// Penny (knocking and entering, holding up a pair of superman undershorts.): Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.// Leonard: Those are not mine.// Penny: Really, they have your little name label in them.// Leonard: Yeah, no, I do, I use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I’m not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.// Missy: Hi.// Penny: Wow, you don’t look that much alike.// Howard: Can I get a hallelujah.// Sheldon: Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.// Howard: Hallelujah.// Raj (running in): Hey, guess what. I’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.// Penny: Hey, good for you, Raj.// Raj: Yes, I’m very hopeful. Hello Missy. (He waves his hand. It keeps waving.) They mentioned there may be side effects.// Scene: The same, later.// Raj: So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?// Missy: Well, there’s Dr Patel at our church.// Raj: Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.// Howard: Do you like motorcycles, ‘cos I ride a hog.// Raj: A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.// Howard: You still have to wear a helmet.// Raj: Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?// Missy: The sex book?// Raj: The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.// Penny (to Leonard): Hey, Sheldon’s sister’s pretty cute, I w….// Leonard: I wasn’t staring!// Penny: I didn’t say you were, I just said she was cute.// Leonard: Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect.// Penny: Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?// Sheldon: I’m not ignoring my sister. I’m ignoring all of you.// Leonard: I brought snacks.// Missy: Oh my! Gherkins and….// Leonard: Onion dip, it’s onion dip.// Missy: Oh.// Leonard: We don’t entertain much.// Raj: Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?// Missy: I guess.// Raj: We Indians invented them. You’re welcome.// Howard: Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You’re welcome!// Penny: Missy, I’m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?// Missy: God yes. Thanks.// Penny: You’re welcome.// Missy: Bye guys.// Howard: Bye Missy.// Leonard: Bye Missy, see you.// Penny: Goodbye Leonard!// Leonard: Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.// Howard: Okay, you two have to back off.// Raj: Why should I back off, you back off dude.// Leonard: Excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister.// Howard: So what, you’ve already got Penny.// Leonard: How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?// Howard: So I can have Penny?// Leonard: Hell, no!// Sheldon: Excuse me, can I interject something. I’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?// Leonard: Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?// Sheldon: I guess. Don’t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.// Howard: I’m a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!// Raj: Hey, look at me, I don’t have a foreskin.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Leonard: Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?// Sheldon: Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.// Leonard: That’s fascinating, but I…// Sheldon: I didn’t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.// Leonard: Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister.// Sheldon: Oh. Okay. You know, I don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought.// Leonard: That’s great, but I….// Sheldon: What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.// Leonard: Whatever. You have to do something about it.// Sheldon: Why?// Leonard: Because she’s your sister.// Sheldon: I don’t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways.// Leonard: Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.// Sheldon: I hadn’t considered that. We do share DNA.// Leonard: Uh-huh.// Sheldon: So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.// Leonard: Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring.// Sheldon: You’re right. If someone wants to get at Missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me.// Scene: The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.// Raj: I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!// Howard: I’m warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.// Sheldon: Alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I’m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.// Howard: Who are you to decide that?// Leonard: He’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.// Sheldon: You’re out too, by the way.// Leonard: Say what?// Sheldon: It’s nothing personal, I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.// Howard (to Raj, who is smiling): What are you so happy about?// Raj: I’m not happy, it’s the medication, I can’t stop smiling. (Waves hand at mouth. It keeps waving.)// Sheldon: Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.// Howard: Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?// Leonard: We all make mistakes, let’s move on.// Raj: Excuse me, but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here.// Sheldon: How so?// Raj: Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.// Sheldon: In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.// Raj (waving finger at him): I think you’re focussing entirely too much on the drugs. (Finger keeps waving. Leonard has to reach out and stop it.)// Howard: Is it ‘cause I’m Jewish, ‘cause I’d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.// Sheldon: This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.// Leonard: Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.// Sheldon: Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.// Missy (who has just entered): Oh really?// Sheldon: Oops.// Missy: Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?// Sheldon: Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me. // Leonard (to Penny who is standing next to him grinning): We all make mistakes, let’s move on.// Missy: Okay. I’m not even going to ask why you’re pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?// Sheldon: Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.// Missy: What on earth are you talking about?// Sheldon: Let me explain. You see, I’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.// Missy: And what do you mean, mediocre stock?// Sheldon: That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.// Missy: Sheldon 2.0?// Sheldon: Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.// Missy: You have got to be kidding me!// Sheldon: Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.// Missy: Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I’ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God’s special little people.// Sheldon: I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended.// Missy: I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember? (Sheldon hurriedly crosses his legs.)// Sheldon: I have an alternate proposal.// Missy: Go on.// Sheldon: You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.// Scene: The living room. Sheldon enters limping, holding his groin area.// Sheldon: Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.// Howard: Look, we have to settle this.// Leonard: I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time.// Raj: She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.// Howard: Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.// Raj: Don’t start with me dude.// Howard: You want to go again? Let’s go.// Leonard: Sit down.// Howard: Okay.// Leonard: If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it the right way. The honourable way.// (Time shift. Sheldon enters to hear sounds of fighting. It becomes apparent that the guys are playing a boxing game on a Nintendo Wii.)// Leonard: And he’s down!// Howard: Come on, come on, get up.// Leonard: Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.// Sheldon: I weep for humanity.// Leonard: Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Leaves and knocks on Penny’s door.)// Penny (answering): Ah, hey Leonard.// Leonard: Hi Penny, how’s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?// Penny: Uh, pretty much, why?// Leonard: Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?// Penny: Of course.// Missy: Hi, Leonard, what’s up?// Leonard: Well, since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?// Missy: That’s so sweet. But no thanks.// Leonard: Oh. You have other plans, or…?// Missy: No.// Leonard: Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.// Missy: Thanks. See you.// Leonard (returning): Um, here’s something we didn’t anticipate.// (Time shift. Penny opens door to Howard.)// Penny: What do you want, Howard?// Howard: I’m fine, thanks for asking. I’ve come to call on Missy.// Penny: Missy?// Missy: Hi Howard.// Howard: The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?// Missy: Not really. No.// Howard: Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. (Taps against doorpost. While humming he tries to perform a trick, but the cane falls in half with a yellow handkerchief flying out. Howard has to retrieve the pieces.) Da-dah! (Emerges with the handkerchief, on which are written the words “will you go out with me?”)// Howard: Okay. (Does something with hands, from which another yellow handkerchief emerges. This one reads “are you sure?” Missy closes the door.)// (Time shift. Penny opens the door to Raj.)// Raj: Thank you. I apprec…. (looks panicked) apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.// Penny: Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off? (Raj nods.)// Missy: Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you’d show up.// (Raj attempts to speak. All that emerges is a high pitched wail. After a few more attempts he turns and leaves down the stairs, still making the same sound.)// Missy: We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.// Scene: The stairwell. Missy and Sheldon are descending.// Missy: Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?// Sheldon: Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.// Missy: Yeah, I’ll just tell her you said hey.// Sheldon: Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. (Holds out hand to shake.)// Missy: Come on, Shelly. (Hugs him. He looks uncomfortable, then hugs back half heartedly.) I want you to know I’m very proud of you.// Sheldon: Really?// Missy: Yup, I’m always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.// Sheldon: You tell people I’m a rocket scientist?// Missy: Well yeah.// Sheldon: I’m a theoretical physicist.// Missy: What’s the difference?// Sheldon: What’s the difference?// Missy: Goodbye Shelly.// Sheldon: My God! Why don’t you just tell them I’m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.Series 01 Episode 16 – The Peanut Reaction// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.

The guys enter. Sheldon is dressed as a medieval monk, Howard is a court jester, Raj is a medieval gentleman and Leonard is a knight.// Sheldon: Worst Renaissance Fair ever.// Leonard: Please let it go, Sheldon.// Sheldon: It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.// Leonard: You’re nitpicking.// Sheldon: Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.// Howard: Renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. They’re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.// Sheldon: Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”// Howard: I don’t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.// Penny (arriving with a man in tow): Hi guys. Looks like you’ve been to the Renaissance fair. I’m hoping.// (arriving with a man in tow)// Sheldon: Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.// Penny: Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.// Howard: Hello.// Leonard: Hi.// Eric: Hey.// Leonard: So, yeah, good to see you.// Penny: Yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. We should really go.// Eric: Yeah.// Penny(leaving): Bye guys.// (leaving)// Eric (leaving, to Howard): Like your hat.// (leaving, to Howard)// Howard: Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.// Leonard: It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on.// Raj: By moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?// Sheldon: That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.// Leonard: Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.// Sheldon: You’re wearing modern underwear?// Leonard: Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?// Sheldon: I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.// Leonard: You went out and bought linen?// Sheldon: Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.// Leonard: Borrowed?// Credits sequence// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.// Howard: Are you saying that you’ve been holding back?// Leonard: Of course. Out of respect.// Howard: So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?// Raj: Who were you respecting then?// Leonard: What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.// Sheldon: Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.// Leonard: Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?// Raj: Doesn’t count.// Leonard: Why not?// Raj: What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.// Howard: You’re only saying that because of what happened to you.// Leonard: What happened to you?// Raj: N-n-n-nothing happened to me.// Howard: It wasn’t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.// Raj: H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.// Leonard: Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.// Howard: Like who?// Leonard: Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable.// Raj: What about Leslie Winkle.// Sheldon: Oh no.// Raj: Why?// Sheldon: Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me.// Raj: I think she’s smoking hot.// Howard: I’d hit that.// Sheldon: You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.// Leonard: Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.// Howard: Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.// Raj: Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.// Howard: You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?// Raj: I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it. (Leaving) And he told me his name was Kimberley!// (Leaving)// Scene: The university cafeteria.// Sheldon: You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?// Leonard: How?// Sheldon: If we were, the food would be better.// Leslie (arriving): Hey, Leonard.// (arriving)// Leonard: Hey, Leslie.// Leslie: Hey, dummy.// Sheldon: Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.// Leslie: Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.// Leonard: Uh, sure.// Sheldon: Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.// Leslie: Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.// Leonard: Where did you hear that?// Leslie: Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me. (Shows him text.)// (Shows him text.)// Leonard: Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.// Leslie: I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you’re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.// Leonard: Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.// Leslie: No, I’m all done with casual sex. From now on I’m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.// Leonard: Really, what changed?// Leslie: It’s hard to say, I guess there’s just a time in every woman’s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn’t know.// Leonard: Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?// Leslie: Anyway, I just figure it’s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?// Leonard: Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?// Leslie: Your place, we’ll order Chinese, you’ll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.// Leonard: Sounds fun.// Leslie: I’ll leave the details up to you, I think it’s better if you assume the male role.// Leonard: Thank you, that’s very thoughtful.// Leslie: Great. Call me.// Scene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed smartly and placing wine on the table. Sheldon enters.// Sheldon: Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.// Leonard: Terrific.// Sheldon: You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school.// Leonard: I kind of have other plans tonight.// Sheldon: But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.// Leonard: Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over.// Sheldon: Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.// Leonard: Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over.// Sheldon: Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.// Leonard: Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?// Sheldon: Well, statistically speaking…// Leonard: Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.// Sheldon: Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?// Leonard: You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?// Sheldon: You want me to leave the apartment?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?// Sheldon: Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.// Leonard: I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.// Sheldon: Well alright then.// Scene: The entrance lobby. Sheldon is sitting on the bottom step using his laptop. Penny comes down the stairs.// Penny: Sheldon? What are you doing?// Sheldon: Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.// Penny: Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?// Sheldon: I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.// Penny: Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?// Sheldon: Alone?// Penny: Yeah, why not?// Sheldon: What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.// Penny: Well then don’t order popcorn.// Sheldon: No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.// Penny: Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.// Sheldon: I don’t drink coffee.// Penny: They have other things.// Sheldon: What do they have?// Penny: I don’t know, you know, cookies, pastries…// Sheldon: Pastries such as bearclaws?// Penny: Yeah, sure.// Sheldon: I don’t like bearclaws.// Leslie (entering): Heya Penny. Dumbass.// (entering)// Sheldon: Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?// Penny: Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists.// Sheldon: Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.// Penny: Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.// Sheldon: Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you.// Leslie: This is pretty good Orange Chicken.// Leonard: Yeah, it’s from Changs.// Leslie: Not Chows?// Leonard: No, Changs.// Leslie: What happened to Chows?// Leonard: It changed.// Leslie: Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have? (Leonard splutters and coughs) I’m sorry, that was a little abrupt.// (Leonard splutters and coughs)// Leonard: A little.// Leslie: I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.// Leonard: I sure hope so.// Leslie: Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?// Sheldon (entering): I’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.// Leslie: Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there’s the lactose intolerance.// Sheldon (preparing an extension cord): Don’t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. (Exits. Extension cord trails after him. Eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose.)// (preparing an extension cord)// (Exits. Extension cord trails after him. Eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose.)// Leonard: Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. (Sheldon knocks and enters again.) What now?// (Sheldon knocks and enters again.)// Sheldon: I have to make pee-pee.// Time shift to later.// Leonard: Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.// Leslie: If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.// Leonard: Well, I think tonight was a very good start.// Leslie: Me too. You’re sure you’re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?// Leonard: No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening.// Leslie: Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I’m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.// Leonard: Sure.// Leslie: Again, it’s your decision, you’re the man.// Penny (voice off, ascending the stairs): No, it wasn’t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.// (voice off, ascending the stairs)// Eric (appearing round corner with Penny): From the Charlie Brown cartoons?// (appearing round corner with Penny)// Penny: No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.// Leonard: Hello.// Penny: Leslie.// Leslie: Hi.// (Penny turns and crosses hall.)// Leonard: Okay, well, goodnight. (Leans in to kiss Leslie.)// (Leans in to kiss Leslie.)// Penny: Okay, well, goodnight. (Grabs Eric and kisses him more passionately.)// (Grabs Eric and kisses him more passionately.)// Leslie (whispering): That ain’t going to make your point. (Grabs him and tries to out-passion Penny. The two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until Leonard grabs Leslie’s ass.) Okay, that’s enough. (Sweetly) Call me (exits.)// (whispering)// (Grabs him and tries to out-passion Penny. The two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until Leonard grabs Leslie’s ass.)// (Sweetly)// (exits.)// Leonard: Right (goes back inside flat. Closes door.)// (goes back inside flat. Closes door.)// Penny (breaking off kiss): Okay, goodnight.// (breaking off kiss)// Eric: What?// Penny: Had a great time, ciao (closes door.)// (closes door.)// Scene: The university lunch room.// Sheldon: I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.// Howard: Come on, Sheldon, there’s so few places I can wear my jester costume.// Sheldon: I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.// Raj: Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.// Sheldon: You mean like Spock?// Raj: Sure.// Sheldon: Fascinating.// Leslie (arriving): Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.// Leonard: Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.// Howard: Hmm, let’s do it. (Sheldon does not move. Leonard looks confused.)// (Sheldon does not move. Leonard looks confused.)// Sheldon: If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.// Leonard: Don’t make this hard for me.// Sheldon: It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.// Leonard: You’re right, it is simple. (Sits with Leslie.)// (Sits with Leslie.)// Scene: The stairs. Sheldon is playing on his computer at the end of the long extension cord.// Penny: Hey, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Penny.// Penny: Third floor tonight. Mixing it up? (Sheldon indicates extension cord.) Oh. You know, I still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something.// (Sheldon indicates extension cord.)// Sheldon: Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?// Penny: Goodnight Sheldon.// Sheldon: Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?// Penny: Excuse me?// Sheldon: I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?// Penny: Okay, where is this coming from?// Sheldon: Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.// Penny: Your arch enemy?// Sheldon: Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.// Penny: Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.// Sheldon: Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.// Penny: Sheldon, come back, you’re losing me.// Sheldon: Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.// Penny: Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry.// Sheldon: She called me dumbass.// Penny: I know. I heard.// Sheldon: Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.// Penny: Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.// Sheldon: No, that response is unacceptable to me.// Penny: Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…// Sheldon: Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.// Penny: Are you going to let me talk?// Sheldon: I’m sorry.// Penny: You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.// Sheldon: You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.// Penny: Okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really Leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.// Sheldon: Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?// Penny: Because love trumps hate.// Sheldon: Oh now you’re just making stuff up.// Penny: Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.// Scene: The apartment. Leonard and Leslie are kissing.// Sheldon (entering): When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I’d like to have a word.// Leonard: If the word is pee-pee, just do it.// Sheldon: Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.// Leslie: Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.// Sheldon: I’m listening, amuse me.// Leslie: Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.// Sheldon: Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.// Leslie: Are you going to let him talk to me like that?// Leonard: Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.// Leslie: No there isn’t, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes. (Sheldon grunts.)// (Sheldon grunts.)// Leonard: Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful.// Sheldon: I hope so, it was a snort of derision.// Leslie: You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.// Leonard: Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.// Leslie: Well, I’m glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.// Leonard: Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal.// Leslie: Oh, it isn’t, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?// Leonard: I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.// Leslie: We can’t let them choose, Leonard, they’re children. (Storms off.)// (Storms off.)// Leonard: Wait, where are you going?// Leslie: I’m sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker. (Leaves.)// (Leaves.)// Sheldon: Look on the bright side.// Leonard: What’s the bright side?// Sheldon: Only nine more months to comic-con.// Leonard: Oh yeah.// Scene: The Renaissance Fair. The guys are in costume. Sheldon is Spock and has a tri-corder.// Sheldon: Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading.// Leonard: Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?// Howard: Yeah.// Sheldon: That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.Series 02 Episode 03 – The Barbarian Sublimation// Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the sofa, using his laptop.

It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.// Sheldon: It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.// Howard and Raj (together): Turtle power!// Sheldon: However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.// Howard: Yeah, so?// Sheldon: I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.// Raj: an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.// Howard: It’s heebie-jeebies.// Raj: I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.// Leonard: Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.// Raj: Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it.// Leonard: Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.// Howard: Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.// Leonard: Fun. We know how much you love that.// Howard: It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.// Sheldon: You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.// Howard: Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.// Sheldon: No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.// Howard: Great, thank you.// Sheldon: Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry.// Raj: What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?// Sheldon: Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China.// Leonard: That should lighten the mood.// Sheldon: What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Oh, right, funeral. (Knock, knock, knock) (solemnly) Amy.// Amy: Hello, Sheldon.// Sheldon: I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?// Amy: I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.// Sheldon: You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.// Amy: Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?// Sheldon: Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.// Amy: But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.// Sheldon: Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.// Amy: Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.// Amy: Thank you, Sheldon.// Sheldon: You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Howard: So, how have you been?// Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine.// Howard: Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?// Mr. Rostenkowski: It’s fine.// Howard: I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?// Bernadette: I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.// Howard: I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.// Bernadette: You could die.// Howard: Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.// Mrs. Rostenkowski: Here’s another beer, honey.// Mr. Rostenkowski: Thank you.// Howard: So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?// Mrs. Rostenkowski: It was good.// Howard: Had no idea you were the chatty one.// Sheldon: 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.// Amy: Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour.// Sheldon: Well, not with that attitude.// Amy: I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.// Sheldon: I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?// Amy: Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.// Sheldon: Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.// Amy: Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest.// Sheldon: How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.// Amy: You, you want to rub something on my chest?// Sheldon: Yes. All over it.// Amy: Maybe we should start with that.// Sheldon: Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.// Amy: Oh, I’m counting on it.// Howard: Okay, dig in.// Mr. Rostenkowski: Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.// Howard: Took the words right out of my mouth.// Bernadette: So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?// Mr. Rostenkowski: I’m going next weekend.// Howard: Oh, you like to fish?// Mr. Rostenkowski: Yes.// Howard: Sure. I can hear it in your voice.// Mrs. Rostenkowski: Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go.// Howard: You know, I hadn’t thought of that. (To Bernadette, whispering) Help me.// Bernadette: Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.// Howard: No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night.// Bernadette: Howie, I think you’d have fun.// Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine, you can tag along.// Bernadette: Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.// Howard: Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.// Bernadette: What thing?// Howard: You know, the thing.// Bernadette: Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.// Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, it’s settled. You and I are going fishing.// Howard: Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help.// Scene: The stairwell.// Howard: I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.// Raj: If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.// Leonard: Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.// Howard: Do either of you guys know how to fish?// Leonard: No.// Raj: No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.// Howard: Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: S’up?// Penny: Step one, worms.// Howard: Ew!// Penny: Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.// Howard: Really?// Penny: You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.// Howard: Okay.// Penny: What are you waiting for?// Howard: I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.// Penny: Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.// Howard: Fine. There.// Leonard: I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.// Howard: Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.// Penny: Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.// Raj: You got this, buddy.// Leonard: Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.// Raj: You can do it.// Penny: That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.// Sheldon (reading): And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.// Amy: That was great. Rub my chest again. (Knock at door)// Sheldon: No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. (Opens door)// Bernadette: How’s the poor thing?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.// Bernadette: Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.// Sheldon: Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?// Amy: I don’t have a bath thermometer.// Sheldon: Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.// Bernadette: This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.// Amy: Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick.// Bernadette: I don’t understand.// Amy: I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.// Bernadette: So you’ve just been lying to him?// Amy: See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.// Bernadette: I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.// Amy: All right. I’ll tell him.// Sheldon (off): Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?// Amy: I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.// Penny: Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?// Howard: No, I’m fine. Keep going.// Penny: All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?// Leonard: It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.// Penny: What, never?// Leonard: My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.// Raj: Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.// Howard: Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.// Raj: Yeah, okay, Howard wins.// Leonard: You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.// Howard: You’re right. Oh! I should do this.// Penny: Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.// Howard: Here we go. Oh!// Penny: Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. (All the guys gag)// Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is dancing to “Walking on Sunshine”. Hears door and turns off stereo.// Amy: Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.// Sheldon: I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.// Amy: Oh?// Sheldon: I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.// Amy: All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.// Sheldon: It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.// Amy: I feel terrible I did this.// Sheldon: It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.// Amy: I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?// Sheldon: In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.// Amy: I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.// Sheldon: Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.// Amy: Are you saying you want to spank me?// Sheldon: I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.// Amy: That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.// Scene: Bernadette’s parents’ garage.// Howard: Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go.// Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s what you’re wearing?// Howard: No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.// Mr. Rostenkowski: Maybe in cartoons.// Howard: Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.// Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.// Howard: Wait, now we’re shooting things?// Mr. Rostenkowski: I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up.// Howard: Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them.// Mr. Rostenkowski: So, why’d you agree to come?// Howard: ‘Cause Bernadette made me.// Mr. Rostenkowski: I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.// Howard: Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop.// Mr. Rostenkowski: You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she’s only four feet tall.// Howard: So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.// Mr. Rostenkowski: Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?// Howard: No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.// Mr. Rostenkowski: Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play.// Howard: Really? Thank you, sir.// Mr. Rostenkowski: Call me Mike.// Howard: Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?// Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about.// Howard: Great couple of gals.// Mr. Rostenkowski: I wouldn’t go that far.// Sheldon: Are you prepared to receive your punishment?// Amy: One second. I want to put on some music.// Sheldon: Why?// Amy: I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.// Sheldon: Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin.// Amy: Oh, my.// Sheldon: Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.// Amy: Then maybe you should spank me harder.// Sheldon: Maybe I will.// Amy: Ooh!Series 06 Episode 11 – The Santa Simulation// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.// Leonard: Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.// Penny: You’re so butch.// Leonard: Aw, I got a little paper cut.// Penny: Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.// Leonard: Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.// Penny: Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?// Leonard: Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.// Penny: Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?// Leonard: Little bit, yeah.// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Oh, great! I’ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.// Sheldon: Yeah, oh, I’m sorry. I should’ve mentioned this earlier. You’re not invited.// Amy: Why not?// Sheldon: Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.// Amy: By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?// Sheldon: Yeah, like a bunch of savages.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Bernadette is on the webcam.// Bernadette: Saturday night? But I’ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.// Howard: But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.// Bernadette: You’re an idiot.// Howard: I’m your idiot. Forever.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj: So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place.// Stuart: Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!// Credits sequence.// Leonard: All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.// Sheldon: A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas.// Stuart: What’s wrong with Christmas?// Sheldon: Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?// Howard:Pirate with a peg leg?// Sheldon: Actually that helps, thank you.// Leonard: Would you just look inside?// Sheldon: Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.// Leonard: It’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. Thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.// Sheldon: Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.// Leonard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.// Raj: Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.// Stuart: Do you hear yourself when you say these things?// Leonard: Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?// Sheldon: I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.// Leonard: Fine. Howard, what do you do?// Howard: I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.// Leonard: And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.// Howard: Okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.// Raj: No, screw that noise, I’m going in. Hang on, Santa, I’m coming for you.// Leonard: Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game.// Raj: But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?// Sheldon: Lucky.// Leonard: Okay, come on, moving on.// Raj: Wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.// Stuart: Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.// Penny (entering): Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.// (entering)// Sheldon: I know they’re making a rhetorical point, I just don’t know what it is.// Penny: See you, boys. We are going drinking.// Raj: Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.// Bernadette: Sorry, Raj, it’s girls’ night out.// Amy: Maybe another time.// Leonard: Okay…// Penny: Come on.// Raj: Ooh! Girls’ night, girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!// Stuart: How does he not hear that?// Scene: A bar.// Amy: So, what’s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?// Bernadette: No!// Penny: No!// Amy: Geez, who’s Forever 63 now?// Raj: Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.// Amy: Thanks.// Penny: Wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. And not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of Pabst.// Raj: My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout.// Bernadette: Hey, let’s help Raj meet a girl tonight.// Raj: No, no, no, I’m fine.// Penny: Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?// Amy: Let’s get him laid!// Raj: Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night.// Penny: Raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you.// Bernadette: Yeah, you’re a real catch. I know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life.// Raj: That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?// Bernadette: We’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.// Raj: Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.// Penny: Nines or tens?// Raj: Okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.// Bernadette: Bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?// Raj: In a New Delhi minute.// Stuart: I don’t remember you buying these miniatures in my store.// Leonard: Oh, uh, yeah. I got ’em on Amazon.// Stuart: Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?// Leonard: I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.// Stuart: Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.// Howard: Can we please move this along?// Leonard: Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.// Howard: Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile.// Leonard: Great. What do you do?// Howard: I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”// Sheldon: I open the chest.// Leonard: It’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.// Stuart: That’s not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.// Leonard: Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.// Howard: Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?// Leonard: Walls are getting closer.// Stuart: Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.// Sheldon: Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.// Leonard: You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.// Howard: What are we supposed to do?// Leonard: Seven, six.// Sheldon: Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.// Howard: Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.// Leonard: Three, two.// Stuart: Somebody sing the damn song.// Sheldon: Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even// Leonard: The walls are getting slower.// Sheldon: Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.// Leonard:The walls stop. You’re safe.// Howard: That was amazing, Sheldon.// Stuart: How did you know that?// Sheldon: It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.// Leonard: Okay, continuing our quest.// Sheldon: W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…// Scene: The bar.// Bernadette: Looks like he’s doing pretty good.// Penny: Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.// Amy: That is some low-hanging fruit.// Bernadette: Oh, here he comes.// Penny: So, how’d it go?// Raj: Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.// Penny: Ooh!// Bernadette: Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.// Raj: What?// Bernadette: I’m sorry, Raj.// Raj: Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart, I’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t.// Penny: Oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them.// Raj: No, it’s not. She was too beautiful for me.// Bernadette: Why would you say that?// Raj: It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.// Amy: The two of them? I don’t understand.// Raj: Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.// Amy: And you liked Bernadette also?// Raj: That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.// Amy: So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.// Raj: No, not really.// Penny: Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?// Raj: Not that I can think of.// Bernadette: Think harder.// Raj: Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn’t, I mean, at all. What?// Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is still singing.// Sheldon: Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.// Howard: Done?// Sheldon: I think the word you’re looking for is bravo.// Leonard: Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.// Sheldon: Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?// Leonard: I don’t know. What’s the difference?// Sheldon: Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.// Leonard: Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.// Sheldon: What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?// Leonard: You see those, too.// Sheldon: Oh, it’s like I’m really there.// Stuart: I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I’ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.// Howard: Good story.// Leonard: What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?// Sheldon: Yes. What, is there a problem?// Leonard: No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.// Sheldon: Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.// Leonard: Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit.// Sheldon: Oh, don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?// Leonard: Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.// Stuart: What was so bad about them?// Leonard: I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded.// Sheldon: No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.// Leonard: It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.// Sheldon: Yeah, I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.// Raj: Amy, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.// Amy: It’s fine. I’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn’t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I’d give him back his insulin.// Bernadette: Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.// Amy: Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand.// Raj: I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.// Amy: You think that’s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.// Raj: Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.// Amy: I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.// Raj: It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.// Amy: It is, isn’t it?// Raj: But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.// Amy: I do. And don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too.// Raj: Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.// Amy: Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I’m good. We can go now.// Raj: Damn it.// Penny: What?// Raj: Now that I know she doesn’t like me, I’m kind of into her.// Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is writing numbers on a whiteboard.// Sheldon: All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.// Howard: Great. Let’s do it. (They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells)// (They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells)// Leonard: The drawbridge is lowering.// Stuart: My carpal tunnel’s acting up.// Sheldon: Play through the pain.// Leonard: You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.// Howard: Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that.// Stuart: I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.// Sheldon: But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.// Howard: Wait, what are you doing?// Sheldon: You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?// Leonard: Uh, okay.// Sheldon: My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.// Leonard: This is weird, right?// Sheldon: Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!// Leonard: Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.// Scene: The apartment, late at night.// Sheldon: Santa?// Santa: Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.// Sheldon: Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots.// Santa: Oh. I’ve been wanting to talk to you. I’m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn’t one of them.// Sheldon: I understand.// Santa: But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.// Sheldon: Oh, I hope it’s a train.// Santa: Oh, it’s better than a train.// Sheldon: Two trains?// Santa: Better.// Sheldon: I’m getting three trains.// Santa: Okay, open ’em. (It’s a cannon, pointed at Sheldon) This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!// (It’s a cannon, pointed at Sheldon)// Sheldon: Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense…// Santa: Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork.

Help me out here, I can’t afford another demerit.// Leonard: Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.// Sheldon: Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?// Leonard: I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere.// Sheldon: I’m deleting it.// Penny: Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it yet.// Leonard: You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.// Sheldon: No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts.// Leonard: There is no season three. They cancelled that show.// Sheldon: Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.// Leonard: They did.// Penny: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?// Sheldon: Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?// Penny: As a rule, no.// Sheldon: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what happened.// Penny: Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?// Sheldon: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.// Leonard: Oh, please, don’t do that.// Sheldon: No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.// Penny: I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.// Leonard: Ah, don’t.

The optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out.// Raj: Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work, right?// Howard: Why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.// Raj: Wait, hold on. This is weird.// Howard: What?// Raj: I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating, and I found her blog.// Howard: Cool. Anything juicy?// Raj: She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist, too?// Howard: You know what’s going on, don’t you?// Raj: Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.// Howard: I can’t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.// Raj: Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.// Howard: Keep reading. What does it say?// Raj: No, no, I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary.// Howard: It’s exactly what it’s like. Keep reading.// Raj: No, this is creepy.// Howard: Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.// Raj: It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh, look who’s got the sweetest kisses.// Howard: Should I go?// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Leonard: With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?// Penny: It’s six thirty in the morning.// Leonard: I thought you grew up on a farm.// Sheldon (on phone): Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and I don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?// (on phone)// Amy: I’m sorry you’re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.// Sheldon: I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.// Amy: Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.// Sheldon: Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.// Amy: You know, I might be able to help you with this. There’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.// Sheldon: Yeah, but I just told you, I don’t have a problem with closure.// Amy: You sure about that?// Sheldon: Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing.// (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.)// Scene: Raj’s office.// Howard: Ready to go to lunch?// Raj: Do you think I’m feminine?// Howard: Yeah. Let’s go.// Raj: Thanks a lot.// Howard: What’s going on?// Raj: I broke down, and I read Lucy’s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.// Howard: Just a little? That’s great.// Raj: I have to talk to her about this.// Howard: Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.// Raj: Well, that doesn’t seem fair.// Howard: Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?// Raj: No, it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair.// Howard: So take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.// Raj: Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?// Howard: The key to her heart. That’s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?// Raj: I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.// Leonard: So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.// Penny: It was cute.// Leonard: Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst.// Penny: What’s wrong with cute?// Leonard: It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.// Penny: So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?// Leonard: You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.// Penny: I liked it. I’m excited.// Leonard: Well, then, tell your face.// Penny: What do you want from me?// Leonard: You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.// Penny: Oh, come on, don’t be like that.// Leonard: Well…// Penny: I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.// Leonard: Really?// Penny: Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.// Leonard: All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.// Penny: Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.// Amy: I’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.// Sheldon: I take issue with the word compulsive.// Amy: All I’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…// Sheldon: …tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let’s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?// Amy: I’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming.// Sheldon: By playing tic-tac-toe?// Amy: Yep. Your turn.// Sheldon: Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn’t finish.// (She wipes the board clean.)// Amy: Exactly. How does that make you feel?// Sheldon: The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.// Amy: And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.// Sheldon: Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.// Amy: Come on, you can do this.// Sheldon: You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.// Amy: Yeah, sounds like a drag.// Penny: Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?// Bernadette: Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?// Penny: Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it.// Bernadette: Why does this bother you so much?// Penny: I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?// Bernadette: Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.// Penny: See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.// Bernadette: Well, there’s no reason you can’t.// Penny: You think?// Bernadette: Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about.// Penny: Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.// Howard (on webcam): Hey, what’s up?// (on// webcam)// Raj: Uh, Lucy’s coming over. I need some advice.// Howard: However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.// Raj: Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.// Howard: I don’t know. Go with hockey.// Raj: Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that’s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.// Lucy: Hi.// Raj: Come in.// Lucy: Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.// Raj: Yeah, well, I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she’ll rip your face off.// Scene: The apartment. Montage of scenes.// 1. Amy (singing): O’er the land of the free, and the home of the… Next.// (singing)// 2. (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes) Amy: That’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?// (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes)// Sheldon: Yes.// Amy: Let’s box it up.// Sheldon: Let’s box it up.// 3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune) Amy: That’s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!// (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune)// :// 4. Amy: Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can’t come true.// Sheldon: Lucky for you, ’cause I wished you were dead.// Lucy: I like your jersey.// Raj: Thanks. I love hockey.// Lucy: Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who’s your favourite player?// Raj: Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?// Lucy: It’s still a little frozen in the middle.// Raj: Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.// Lucy: Is something going on?// Raj: What do you mean?// Lucy: Well, you’re acting all weird, and I’m pretty weird, so I think I know what I’m talking about.// Raj: I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking.// Lucy: I think I’m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.// Raj: Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.// Lucy: Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn’t think anybody actually read it.// Raj: No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.// Lucy: Why were you acting so strange tonight?// Raj: You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.// Lucy: Raj, I didn’t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you’re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.// Raj: I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.// Lucy: So, are you okay?// Raj: Yeah.// Lucy: Good. Do you even like hockey?// Raj: No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.// Penny: So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.// Leonard: The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.// Penny: See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you.// Leonard: Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.// Penny: No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about.// Leonard: Those things can still happen.// Penny: Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.// Leonard: That’s a big deal.// Penny: It is, isn’t it?// Leonard: So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?// Penny: Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.// Sheldon: Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.// Amy: I’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.// Sheldon: Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…// Amy: And?// Sheldon: Doesn’t matter, does it?// Amy: I’m proud of you, Sheldon. (Exits.)// (Exits.)// Sheldon: And a complete sucker.// (Montage of sccenes)// 1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Sheldon: Oh, yeah.// (Redraws tic-tac-toe board)// 2. (Blows out all candles on the cake)// (Blows out all candles on the cake)// 3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) Sheldon: There he is.// (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.)// 4. Sheldon (singing): And the home of the brave.// 5. (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern) Sheldon: Don’t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.// (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern)// Almost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!// Penny: Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you’re in my life.// Sheldon: I love you, too.// Scene: Later.// Sheldon: Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.Series 06 Episode 22 – The Proton Resurgence// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.// Penny: Got it.// Sheldon: Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!// Leonard: Nice shot.// Penny: Eh, his giant head did most of the work.// Sheldon: Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.// Leonard: You’re kidding. He’s still alive?// Sheldon: Yes.// Penny: Who’s Professor Proton?// Leonard: He was the host of this great… Hey!// Penny: Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.// Sheldon: Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.// Leonard: It was pretty cool.// Penny: Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.// Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.// Leonard: Hire him to do what?// Sheldon: Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.// Leonard: It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?// Sheldon: Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.// Leonard: Do you remember his old theme song?// Sheldon: Of course I do.// Together: Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?// Howard: Why don’t you put her in a kennel?// Raj: Why don’t you put your mother in a home?// Howard: To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.// Raj: Thank you.// Sheldon: It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.// Leonard: You’re kidding.// Howard: You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?// Sheldon: And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.// Howard: How’d you get him to come to your house?// Sheldon: As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.// Leonard: And he wrote him a cheque.// Sheldon: Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Raj: Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.// Howard: You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?// Raj: And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.// Howard: Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?// Raj: It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.// Howard: Classy dog.// Raj: Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.// Howatd: I feel for ya. I’ve got a psychotic mommy, too.// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.// Sheldon (off): Leonard, are you in bed?// (off)// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon (off): Me, too.// Leonard: Great.// Sheldon (off): I can’t sleep.// Leonard: Well, I can, so shut up.// Sheldon (off): Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?// Leonard: Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.// Sheldon (off): I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.// Leonard: That’s not ridiculous. Good night.// Sheldon (off): Do you have cufflinks?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon (off): Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?// Leonard: Okay, good night.// Sheldon (off): Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?// Leonard: What?// Sheldon (off): I still can’t sleep.// Howard: She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?// Bernadette: Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.// Howard: It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.// Bernadette: And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.// Howard: Yeah, that’s what I was doing.// Bernadette: You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.// Howard: Really?// Bernadette: Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.// Howard: Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone.// Bernadette: Where’d she go?// Howard: I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.// Bernadette: Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.// Howard: No, I wasn’t. You were.// Bernadette: No, I wasn’t.// Howard: Yes, you were!.// Bernadette: Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.// Sheldon: I’m getting worried.// Penny: Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.// Sheldon: Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.// (Phone rings)// Leonard: Where is he?// Sheldon: The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.// (On the third floor landing)// Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.// Arthur: I agree.// Sheldon: Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.// Arthur: Just, just call me Arthur.// Sheldon: Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.// Arthur: No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator.// Sheldon: Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.// Arthur: Is, uh, is he dangerous?// Leonard: Actually, he’s a genius.// Sheldon: I am.// Arthur: That doesn’t answer my question.// Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.// Arthur: Hi.// Penny: Hello.// Arthur: Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.// Sheldon: Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.// Arthur: Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?// Leonard: Yes, sir.// Arthur: You’re the genius.// (Back in the Apartment)// Penny: So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?// Arthur: It, it’s hard to say. I’m, I’m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.// Leonard: We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.// Arthur: Well, there, there really isn’t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children’s parties to, to make a living.// Leonard: That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.// Arthur: You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?// Sheldon: Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.// Arthur: You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.// Sheldon: Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?// Arthur: No, no. I, I hate that puppet.// Sheldon: Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!// Arthur: I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?// Scene: Bernadette’s car.// Bernadette: Cinnamon!// Howard: Cinnamon!// Bernadette: You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent.// Howard: Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy.// (In a bad Indian accent)// Bernadette (likewise): Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?// (likewise)// Howard: Nice.// Bernadette: Thanks.// Howard: When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on.// Bernadette: It turns you on when I sound like Raj?// Arthur: Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?// Penny: I think I know.// Sheldon: It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.// Penny: Okay, I didn’t know.// Penny: See, I’m not a scientist like them.// Arthur: I, I figured that out.// Sheldon: Potato clock. Do potato clock.// Penny: What’s that?// Arthur: I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.// Penny: Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?// Arthur: No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done.// Sheldon: What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.// Arthur: No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long.// Leonard: Then what is it?// Arthur: I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more.// Sheldon: Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.// Arthur: What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.// Sheldon: Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446// Penny: I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.// Arthur: Uh, thanks.// Penny: But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?// Arthur: What do you two talk about?// Sheldon: I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?// Arthur: I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.// Sheldon: Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.// Arthur: No, I, I get that.// Sheldon: But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.// Leonard: I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.// Sheldon: Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.// Arthur: Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.// Leonard: It’s important you know how much you mean to us.// Arthur: Uh-oh.// Penny: Arthur, are you okay?// Arthur: I’m having a problem with my pacemaker.// Leonard: I’ll, I’ll call for help.// Penny: Any chance we could plug it into the potato?// Arthur: No.// Scene: The telescope lab. Raj’s phone rings.// Raj: Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.// Paramedic: Your vitals are stable, but let’s take you in for some tests just to be safe.// Leonard: You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?// Sheldon: I’ll do it.// Arthur: He’s not a relative, he’s not allowed, right?// Paramedic: No, that’s not a rule. He can go.// Sheldon: Oh, yeah.// Arthur: I can’t catch a break today.// Penny: We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.// Leonard: I’m sorry things turned out this way.// Arthur: Well, at, at this point, I’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs.// Sheldon: Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.// Bernadette: Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.// Howard: Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?// Bernadette: It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?// Howard: It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.// (Skype tone) I// Raj: Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?// Howard: What?// Raj: A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.// Howard: You have her?// Bernadette: Oh, thank God she’s okay.// Raj: Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.// Howard: I’m really sorry.// Bernadette: Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?// Raj: Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.// Bernadette: So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?// Raj: Well, I, I thought about…// Bernadette: Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.// Raj: Sorry. I, I just…// Bernadette: Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.// Howard: Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.// Scene: A hospital room.// Sheldon: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.// Arthur: Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.// Sheldon: Want me to sing it again?// Arthur: No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.// Sheldon: There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?// Arthur: No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.// Sheldon: Name it.// Arthur: Well, I’m, I’m booked to do a children’s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don’t feel up to it.// Sheldon: Oh, you’re not. You look awful.// Arthur: Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you’d fill in for me.// Sheldon: Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?// Arthur: Yeah.// Sheldon: Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.// Arthur: Or a Korean family in Alhambra.// Sheldon: But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?// Arthur: Sounds great.// Sheldon: So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.// Arthur: What, Whatever.// Sheldon: Father.// Arthur: Sure, what the hell.Series 06 Episode 23 – The Love Spell Potential// Scene: A taxi// Bernadette: Burbank Airport, please.// Penny: Vegas, here we come.// Bernadette: No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.// Amy: No rules?

Leonard?// Leonard: Yeah?// Sheldon: I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.// Leonard: Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.// Sheldon: Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.// Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, (Nicolas Cage voice) Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.// (Nicolas Cage voice)// Leonard: See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.// Sheldon: As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.// Raj: Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. (Text sound) Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya.// (Text sound)// Leonard: Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started.// Raj: You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye.// Howard: We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says, (Raj voice) don’t worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest. (Nicolas Cage voice) Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend.// (Raj voice)// Sheldon: Go on, give him your lunch money.// Scene: A restaurant// Raj: I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.// Lucy: Me, too.// Raj: Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.// Lucy: Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.// Raj: Really?// Lucy: Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you’ll know why.// Raj: I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that.// Lucy: Oh, it’s okay. I’ve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.// Raj: What else have you been thinking about doing?// Lucy: Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs.// Raj: I like your bangs.// Lucy: Oh, thanks, I like ’em, too.// Raj: What else?// Lucy: Mmm, it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.// Raj: Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.// Lucy: I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53// Leonard: I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.// Howard: Uh, it does. (Creaking sound)// (Creaking sound)// Sheldon: He does sound effects, too!// Leonard: Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. (Clicking sounds) Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. (Strange howl)// (Clicking sounds)// (Strange howl)// Sheldon: Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. (Blows raspberry)// (Blows raspberry)// Penny: Guess who?// Howard: What are you doing back?// Bernadette: That’s an excellent question. Amy?// Amy: Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.// Bernadette: Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.// Amy: I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.// Penny: Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it.// Amy: You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend.// Sheldon: Ah, that’s my girl.// Leonard: No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun.// Sheldon: It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?// Leonard: What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.// Sheldon: Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.// Penny: Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has.// Leonard: So, what do you say?// Sheldon: I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.// Howard: A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, (Al Pacino voice) You’re playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.// (Al Pacino voice)// Scene: Later, the same.// Penny: Okay, who wants a drink?// Sheldon: Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.// Penny: Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you.// Leonard: Double potion, please.// Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!// Sheldon: Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.// Howard: What do you do?// Leonard: I draw my broadsword.// Sheldon: I ready my quarter-staff.// Penny: I drink my potion.// Bernadette: I say we attack the big one.// Penny: You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.// Howard: The dungeon master’s supposed to roll.// Penny: Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?// Howard: Uh, fifteen or higher.// Penny: Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money.// Sheldon: Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.// Penny: More potion, please.// Leonard: Yeah.// Scene: The restaurant.// Raj: How are your crab cakes?// Lucy: Kind of funky.// Raj: That’s great.// Lucy: It is? Does funky mean something different in India?// Raj: No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance.// Lucy: Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ’em.// Raj: Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?// Waiter: Everything all right?// Lucy: Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?// Waiter: Yes.// Lucy: ‘Kay, thanks, bye.// Raj: Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?// Lucy: N-No, it, it’s fine. Uh, He’s from a different country, he doesn’t understand our ways.// Raj: Don’t be silly. Just tell him.// Lucy: I have to go to the bathroom. And it’s not because the crab cakes are funky.// Waiter: So you’re okay here?// Raj: Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.// Scene: Lucy climbs out of bathroom window to find a locked gate.// Lucy: Uh-oh. (Dials phone) Hey, Raj. Funny story.// (Dials phone)// Bernadette: Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.// Howard: Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.// Sheldon: That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.// Leonard: All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out.// Amy: Okay.// Penny: Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.// Amy: Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.// Penny: No, it’s not.// Scene: An alley behind the restaurant.// Raj: Lucy?// Lucy: Hey. Long time no see.// Raj: You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.// Lucy: I’m sorry.// Raj: Why would you leave like that?// Lucy: You were pushing me. I clearly didn’t want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.// Raj: Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?// Lucy: Well, how can I tell you I’m upset if I can’t tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature? It’s scary.// Raj: Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.// Lucy: How could you like me a lot?// Raj: Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful.// Lucy: I’m sweating out of my head.// Howard: The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.// Sheldon: Yay!// Howard: But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.// Sheldon: Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?// Howard: Fine. (Christopher Walken voice) You’d think, after all these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking idiot.// (Christopher Walken voice)// Sheldon: The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.// Leonard: All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.// Amy: Here we go. Fifteen?// Howard: It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.// Sheldon: Wait. Wait. And says?// Howard: Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.// Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.// Bernadette: This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.// Howard: Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure.// Sheldon: Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.// Amy: Sheldon, they’re talking about sex.// Sheldon: Oh, then I’m out.// Penny: Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?// Bernadette: Ooh! Come on, back me up here.// Howard: Oh.// Together: Ooh!// Bernadette: Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.// Leonard: Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.// Howard: The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do you do?// Amy: I don’t like this.// Sheldon: You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.// (off)// (Knock, knock, knock)// Amy: What?// Sheldon: I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.// Amy: You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.// Sheldon: Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.// Amy: I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.// Sheldon: Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.// Amy: Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?// Sheldon: Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.// Amy: And now?// Sheldon: And now what?// Amy: Do you have any interest now?// Sheldon: I have not ruled it out.// Amy: Wow. Talk dirty to me.// Sheldon: I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.// Amy: I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more.// Sheldon: More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years, here we are in bed together.// Amy: Come on. Let’s go back out there.// Sheldon: Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through.// Sheldon: I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour. (Rolls dice) It comes off.// (Rolls dice)// Amy: Oh.// Sheldon: What do you do?// Amy: I kiss you on the lips.// Sheldon: I kiss you back on the (Rolls dice) lips as well. Your turn.// Amy: I remove your armour. What do you do?// Sheldon: I erotically caress your (Rolls dice) nose.// Amy: Keep rolling.// Scene: Outside Sheldon’s bedroom.// Leonard: Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?// Sheldon (off): We’re fine, thank you.// Penny: Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…// Amy: Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my (sound of dice) 14! Yes!// (sound of dice)Series 06 Episode 24 – The Bon Voyage Reaction// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.// Leonard: Oh, that sounds romantic.// Raj: It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.// Leonard: So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?// Raj: I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people.// Sheldon: Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.// Leonard: How’s that been working for you?// Sheldon: Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.// Howard: Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.// Leonard: I have a job.// Sheldon: Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.// Howard: No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.// Leonard: Well, do you really think I have a shot?// Howard: Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.// Leonard: He knows, wow.// Sheldon: Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?// Raj: Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.// Sheldon: No one asked you, Uhura.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Sheldon: Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?// Leonard: What do you think?// Sheldon: Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?// Leonard: Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.// Sheldon: Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting.// Leonard: I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.// Sheldon: I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.// Leonard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?// Leonard: Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.// Sheldon: Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Raj’s apartment. Lucy is looking through Raj’s telescope.// Raj: If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.// Lucy: Wow. Your friend was actually up there?// Raj: Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt// Lucy: Did he take the T-shirt to space?// Raj: Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?// Lucy: I don’t know. How many are there?// Raj: Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.// Lucy: Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?// Raj: Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?// Lucy: Will you be there?// Raj: Of course.// Lucy: Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.// Leonard: Oh, that’s awful.// Penny: Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.// Leonard: So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?// Penny: I thought I said that to you.// Leonard: Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them.// Penny: Wow, Hawking. Good for you.// Leonard: Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.// Penny: Well, how long?// Leonard: Three, four months.// Penny: Whoa. When would you leave?// Leonard: Couple of weeks.// Penny: Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.// Leonard: That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.// Penny: On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?// Leonard: Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory.// Penny: Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.// Leonard: Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up.// Penny: Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it.// Leonard: Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.// Penny: Okay. Good.// Leonard: I do have to ask you one favour.// Penny: Sure.// Leonard: Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.// Penny: Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?// Leonard: Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.// Howard: Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?// Amy: Hello, Rajesh.// Howard (in Raj accent): Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It’s funnier with the accent.// (in Raj accent)// Leonard: There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal.// Sheldon: Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.// Penny: Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.// Bernadette: You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.// Penny: Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.// Raj: Okay. I have a request to make.// Amy: And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.// Raj: The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.// Sheldon: Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy.// Raj: Actually, I was thinking Leonard.// Leonard: Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured.// Howard: What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.// Raj: You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.// Penny: You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first.// Raj: Good idea. Bernadette?// Penny: What the hell?// Raj: Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.// Penny: Oh, yeah.// Bernadette: Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?// Howard: Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary.// Amy: It should be me.// Raj: Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?// Amy: A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.// Sheldon: Fine, I’ll do it.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Amy: So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me.// Lucy: That’s really nice to hear.// Amy: Maybe next week, we could all get together.// Raj: Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.// Amy: Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.// Raj: What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!// Amy: Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!// Raj: Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.// Lucy: I think I have to go to the bathroom.// Raj: We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.// Scene: A store.// Sheldon: This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section.// Penny: Yeah, it does, and here we are.// Sheldon: You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.// Penny: Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches.// Penny: Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.// Sheldon: It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions.// Penny: Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.// Sheldon: I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.// Penny: Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job.// Sheldon: It was you.// Penny: It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…// Sheldon: You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.// Penny: I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do.// Sheldon: They lie so they don’t look petty.// Penny: Yeah.// Sheldon: How?// Penny: Like this. I am so happy for you.// Sheldon: Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.// Raj (on skype): Hey.// (on skype)// Lucy: Hi.// Raj: I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?// Lucy: Amy wasn’t the problem.// Raj: Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.// Lucy: Thank you.// Raj: You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.// Lucy: A party?// Raj: A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there.// Lucy: I’m not sure.// Raj: Oh, please?// Lucy: Raj.// Raj: Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it.// Lucy: Okay.// Raj: Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me.// Bernadette: So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?// Leonard: Yeah.// Bernadette: Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?// Howard: I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something.// Leonard: I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.// Howard: Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.// Leonard: It’s not a competition.// Howard: You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water.// Amy: Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.// Raj: She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?// Sheldon: Um, can I have your attention, everyone? (Clinks glass) That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him.// (Clinks glass)// Leonard: Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say.// Sheldon: Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.// Howard: Cheers.// Penny: Cheers.// Howard: It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Howard: It must’ve killed you when I went to space.// Raj (Looking at phone): Oh, no.// (Looking at phone)// Howard: Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.// Bernadette: What’s going on?// Raj: Uh, go ahead. Read it.// Howard: Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.// Raj: Excuse me.// Penny: Raj, I’m so sorry.// Amy: Me, too.// Sheldon: It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.// Scene: Penny’s car, outside the Airport.// Penny: Well, here we are.// Leonard: Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.// Penny: I’m gonna miss you, too.// Sheldon: Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law.// Penny: Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…// Leonard: Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.// Sheldon: All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you.// Leonard: Would you just relax?// Sheldon: Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.// Penny: Did you bring enough inhalers?// Penny: And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World.// Leonard: I’m covered.// Penny: Okay.// Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made.// Leonard: Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.// Penny: Oh, Leonard.// Sheldon: It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.// Penny: I love you.// Leonard: I love you, too.// Sheldon: Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs.// Penny: Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?// Raj: Hang on.// Penny: Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.// Raj: That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.// Penny: Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?// Raj: No.// Penny: Oh. I’m so sorry.// Raj: No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.// Penny: Oh, Raj.// Raj: Penny, I, I miss her already.// Penny: I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.// Raj: What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?// Penny: You will.// Raj: No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable.// Penny: That’s just the booze talking.// Raj: No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.// Penny: You’re talking to me.// Raj: I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!// Penny: Oh, me, too.// Raj: So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.// Penny: That’s great. Do you want some wine?// Raj: Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…// Amy: Does he ever shut up?// Raj: … but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining…."

It’s getting rough out here.// Sheldon: You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?// Leonard: What was what?// Sheldon: This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.// Leonard: Okay, I’m hanging up now.

(Knock, knock, knock) Penny.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Penny: What’s the matter?// Sheldon: Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.// Penny: Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?// Sheldon: To be honest, I did.// Penny: Aw.// Sheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.// Penny: Good night.// Sheldon: No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.// Penny: You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.// Sheldon: You’re welcome. Good night.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all.// Howard: I’m proud of you.// Raj: Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good.// Sheldon: Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.// Raj: Is that true?// Sheldon: Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.// Howard: Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new.// Raj: How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.// Howard: Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie.// Raj: You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?// Howard: Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you.// Raj: You would do that for me?// Howard: Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.// Raj: Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?// Sheldon: I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.// Scene: A hotel room.// Bernadette (on phone): Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here.// (on phone)// Amy (on phone): Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs.// Bernadette: The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.// Amy: Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.// Bernadette: Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.// Amy: Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…// Penny: No.// Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.// Penny: Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?// Sheldon: You overestimate his significance in my life.// Penny: Mmm.// Sheldon: Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? (Taps out No in morse code on the table)// (Taps out No in morse code on the table)// Penny: Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.// Sheldon: Well, I try.// Penny: All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.// Sheldon: Great. I’ll go first.// Penny: Okay.// Sheldon: By the way, how are you with zippers?// Penny: Why?// Sheldon: Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus.// Scene: The mixer party.// Raj: Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.// Girl: It is. You can download my paper off the university server.// Raj: I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.// Girl: I will.// Raj: All right.// Howard: How’d it go?// Raj: Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.// Howard: Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.// Raj: Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.// Howard: I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.// Raj: That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones.// Mrs Davis: Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.// Howard: Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.// Raj: You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.// Mrs Davis: Okay.// Raj: So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable.// Howard: It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.// Scene: The hotel bar.// Bernadette: I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.// Amy: Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag.// Bernadette: To the advancement of science.// Amy: And to the sick and dying who make it possible.// Bernadette: This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.// Amy: Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.// Waiter: From the two gentlemen at the bar.// Amy: Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.// Bernadette: Be cool.// Amy: You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.// Bernadette: You’re right. Thank you.// Sheldon: Ooh. Bad move.// Penny: Really? Why?// Sheldon: My queen can now take your rook from below.// Penny: So that means I lose, right? It’s over?// Sheldon: If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun.// Penny: Okay, let’s take a break.// Sheldon: We’re all out of alcohol.// Penny: I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.// Sheldon: Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.// Penny: I’m calling him.// Sheldon: Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.// Leonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing): Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?// (on board boat, at a party, dancing)// Penny: Leonard?// Leonard: Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.// Everybody: Hi, Penny!// Penny: Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.// Leonard: Best time of my life.// Sheldon: Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?// Leonard: Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!// Penny: Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.// Random voice: Iceberg!// Leonard: Uh-oh, hang on.// Sheldon: Are you in danger?// Leonard: No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!// Everybody: Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!// Penny: Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.// Sheldon: You were.// Amy: So what happened? How’d it go?// Bernadette: It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.// Amy: So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?// Bernadette: Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.// Amy: And why would no one blame me?// Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m saying.// Amy: Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.// Bernadette: Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight.// Amy: No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.// Bernadette: I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon.// Amy: And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?// Bernadette: Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?// Amy: We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.// Bernadette: Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?// Amy: Sure.// Bernadette: Thanks.// Amy: Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.// Penny: I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?// Sheldon: That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?// Penny: No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.// Sheldon: Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.// Penny: Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?// Sheldon: Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?// Penny: No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.// Sheldon: Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.// Penny: This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?// Sheldon: Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?// Penny: Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.// Sheldon: Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you.// Penny: He did?// Sheldon: Yes.// Penny: Oh, that’s really sweet.// Sheldon: Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap.// Penny: Well, now I miss him even more.// Sheldon: Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.// Penny: Thanks.// Sheldon: Oh, seriously?// Scene: The mixer.// Raj: Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?// Mrs Davis: What?// Raj: I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.// Mrs Davis: Forget about it.// Raj: You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.// Mrs Davis: Is that right?// Raj: Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it.// Sheldon: Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.// Penny: Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.// Sheldon: Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.// Penny: How about we just talk?// Sheldon: All right. In 4D chess…// Penny: No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.// Sheldon: I own nine pairs of pants.// Penny: Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.// Sheldon: I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.// Penny: How about I go first?// Sheldon: But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.// Penny: Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.// Sheldon: I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.// Penny: Oh, God.// Sheldon: And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.// Sheldon: Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.// Penny: That’s your big revelation?// Sheldon: Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.// Penny: Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.// Sheldon: Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.// Penny: What did I do?// Sheldon: I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.// Penny: I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.// Sheldon: It is to me; that’s the point.// Penny: Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.// Sheldon: Your apology is accepted.// Penny: Thank you. How about a hug?// Sheldon: How about a hearty handshake?// Penny: Come on.// Sheldon: Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.// Scene: The hotel room.// Bernadette: Good night.// Amy: Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.// Bernadette: Yeah, that felt nice.// Amy: Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.// Bernadette: So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?// Amy: I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.// Bernadette: Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.// Amy: Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.// Bernadette: Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.// Amy: Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.// Both: Good night.// Mrs Davis: All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.// Raj: Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.// Mrs Davis: Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night.// Raj: Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.// Mrs Davis: Are you hitting on me?// Raj: No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.// Mrs Davis: You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.// Raj: Good night.// Howard: Looks like she accepted your apology.// Raj: And then some. I think we had a moment.// Howard: Oh, please, you did not have a moment.// Raj: Who died and made you king of moments?// Howard: Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment.// Raj: There was.// Howard: There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?// Raj: I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.// Howard: So nothing.// Raj: No, not a thing.// Scene: A bathroom shower.// Penny (acting): Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.// (acting)// Leonard (on ship): That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.// (on ship)// Everyone (on ship): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!// Penny: Aaaaaaah!Series 07 Episode 02 – The Deception Verification// Scene: The stairwell// Sheldon: And here’s another interesting weather fact.// Penny: Another? Great.// Sheldon: Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.// Penny: Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.// Sheldon: Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.// Penny: You know, I will miss this.// Sheldon: I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence.// Penny: I won’t.// Sheldon: That criticism will come later in your report card.// Penny: Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card.// Leonard (in Penny’s apartment): Hello.// (in Penny’s apartment)// Penny (screams): Leonard! Hi!// (screams)// Leonard: Keep your voice down.// Penny: Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.// Leonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you.// Penny: Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?// Leonard: I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.// Penny: Oh, that is so romantic.// Leonard: Uh, sure, that’s why I did it.// Penny: Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.// Sheldon (off): Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.// (off)// Credits sequence.// Scene: The comic book store.// Sheldon: Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.// Stuart: Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live.// Sheldon: Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.// Stuart: Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.// Sheldon: Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart.// Stuart: Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector.// Sheldon: I’m a real collector. How rare is it?// Stuart: Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?// Sheldon: Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.// Howard: What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?// Raj: Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.// Howard: Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot.// Raj: Hey, what’s your problem?// Howard: I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on.// Raj: Why are you on a diet?// Howard: I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section.// Raj: Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.// Sheldon: Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.// Stuart: All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this.// Sheldon: Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.// Stuart: Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare.// Sheldon: Oh.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Leonard: And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.// Penny: Ah.// Leonard: And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.// Penny: Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that’s the pizza.// (Knock on door)// Leonard: Yep. Here’s some money.// Penny: Thank you.// Leonard: And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.// Penny: Hey.// Pizza guy: Twenty-two fifty.// Penny: Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.// Pizza guy: Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.// Penny: Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.// Sheldon: Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.// Penny: That’s nice.// Sheldon: Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.// Penny: Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…// Sheldon: Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.// Penny: Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!// (Toilet flushes)// Sheldon: What, now, do you have company?// Penny: No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…// Sheldon: Oh, I can take a look at it.// Penny: Well…// Sheldon: I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.// Penny: Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom.// Sheldon: That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?// Penny: Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.// Sheldon: Of course. Ask a silly question.// Penny: Oh.// Sheldon: That’s odd.// Penny: Um, what?// Sheldon: There are takeout containers in the trash can.// Penny: So? That’s my dinner from last night.// Sheldon: What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.// Penny: Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.// I// Sheldon: Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!// Penny: What?// Sheldon: Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?// Penny: No.// Sheldon: Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Bernadette: Hi, honey.// Howard: Hey.// Bernadette: I made some brownies. You want one?// Howard: You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.// Bernadette: We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat.// Howard: Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying.// Bernadette: Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?// Howard: Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.// Bernadette: Why can’t she do it?// Howard: ‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back.// Bernadette: Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?// Howard: I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?// Bernadette: This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.// Howard: Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.// Bernadette: Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.// Howard: You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.// Bernadette: That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.// Howard: Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.// Bernadette: It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.// Howard: I feel so stupid. And fat.// Bernadette: It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?// Howard: Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything.// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.// Sheldon: Yes, I am.// Amy: Then what does tweepadock mean?// Sheldon: Uh, elephant?// Amy: Lucky guess.// Sheldon: I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.// Amy: What happened?// Sheldon: I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.// Amy: What?// Sheldon: She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.// Amy: I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.// Sheldon: Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.// Amy: You’re being ridiculous.// Sheldon: Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.// Amy: Poor Leonard.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.// Amy: Do you hear anything?// Sheldon: I hear a woman’s voice.// Amy: Is it Penny?// Sheldon: No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.// Amy: Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.// Sheldon: There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.// Amy: Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.// Sheldon: Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act. (Unlocks door)// (Unlocks door)// Amy: No, Sheldon, don’t.// Sheldon: Aha.// Penny: What the hell?// Sheldon: Leonard?// Penny: Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.// Sheldon: Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?// (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock)// (Knock, knock, knock)// Leonard: I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.// Sheldon: Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.// Leonard: That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.// Sheldon: Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.// Penny: No, he doesn’t.// Leonard: I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.// Sheldon: Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.// Leonard: The what?// Sheldon: Amy?// Amy: Please leave me out of this.// Sheldon: Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.// Leonard: Come on, I said I was sorry.// Sheldon: No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.// Penny: It was fine.// Leonard: Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?// Sheldon: You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?// Leonard: I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.// Amy: Hello, sailor.// Penny: Ooh, now we’re talking.// Sheldon: Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.// Howard: Thanks for coming over.// Raj: No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.// Howard: Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven.// Raj: Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?// Howard: Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?// Raj: Well, it’s kind of hard to tell.// Howard: Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question.// Raj: I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.// Howard: Seriously?// Raj: Do you want my help or not?// Howard: Fine.// Raj: Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.// Howard: Yeah, they kind of do.// Raj: Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)// (Grabs his boob)// Howard: Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.// Raj: Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe.// (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in)// Howard: Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.// Raj: You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you.// Howard: You think?// Raj: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.// Howard: Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie’s ready.// (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out)// Raj: Yay.// Leonard: Good morning.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?// Sheldon: I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.// Leonard: Where do you think I would take you?// Sheldon: Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.// Leonard: I’m going to work. You can come if you want.// Sheldon: Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.// Leonard: No, I don’t.// Sheldon: Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true.// Leonard: I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell.// Sheldon: You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?// Leonard: Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?// Sheldon: All right, I’ll give you that one.// Leonard: Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?// Sheldon: I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.// Leonard: Fine. What I did was wrong.// Sheldon: I wish I could believe you.// Leonard: You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying.// Sheldon: You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.// Leonard: Stop it.// Sheldon: Keep it up?// Leonard: Bye.// Sheldon: Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?// Scene: The stairwell.// Penny: Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?// Amy: Driving Sheldon to work.// Penny: He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?// Amy: Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray.// Penny: I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good.// Sheldon: Thought I heard you out here.// Penny: Hey, Sheldon.// Sheldon: You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.// Penny: Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.// Sheldon: You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.// Penny: Sheldon.// Sheldon: I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?// Amy: Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…// Sheldon: Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy.// Amy: Really?// Sheldon: Yes. You’re either with me or against me.// Amy: You want to take the bus to work?// Sheldon: Maybe there’s a third option.// Amy: FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Leonard: So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.// Howard: That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.// Sheldon: Howard, Raj. Judas.// Leonard: You know what? You’re a crazy person.// Sheldon: A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.// Howard: Stop it.// Sheldon: Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.// Howard: I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.// Raj: A little loud, dude.// Howard: So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?// Leonard: Okay.// Sheldon: I suppose so.// Howard: Thank you.// Raj: Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.// Sheldon: And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.// Leonard: I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.// Penny: I’m so glad you guys are friends again.// Sheldon: And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too.// Penny: Aw.// Sheldon: Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.// Penny: Fifty cents off Vagisil.// Sheldon: Think of me when you apply it.// Raj: Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.// Sheldon: Yeah.// Penny: Me, too.//  // Leonard: Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?// Bernadette: Oh, that happened right after you left.// Leonard: And no one told me?// Howard (crying): Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.// (crying)// Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon): Think of Sheldon when you apply it.// (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon)Series 07 Episode 03 – The Scavenger Vortex// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory// Raj: So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.// Leonard: Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.// Raj: No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.// Sheldon: I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.// Amy: We’re sorry, Rajesh.// Bernadette: Maybe we can do it next week.// Howard: Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.// Raj: Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.// Leonard: Great.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Howard: Hallelujah.// Raj: Because I’ve got something even better planned.// Leonard: Aw.// Howard: Why?// Sheldon: Come on.// Raj: Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.// Howard: Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.// Leonard: We did them at Princeton, too.// Howard: Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college.// Sheldon: That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.// Amy: Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.// Penny: I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.// Leonard: Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…// Howard: And Princeton.// Leonard: A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.// Penny: Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.// Raj: So, uh, who’s in?// Leonard: I think it sounds fun.// Amy: Yeah, me, too.// Various: I’m in, let’s do it.// Sheldon: I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: What’s all this?// Sheldon: Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.// Leonard: You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?// Sheldon: Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.// Raj: Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? (Pumping disco music) Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p… (cough) each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.// (Pumping disco music) S// (cough) e// Sheldon: He is a born showman.// Raj: Any questions?// Howard: Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?// Leonard: It’s not funny.// Sheldon: No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.// Leonard: Ha-ha.// Sheldon: Oh, see? Now he gets it.// Raj: Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.// Bernadette: Should we just do couples?// Leonard: Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.// Penny: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me.// Leonard: I just said, couples sound great.// Penny: Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.// Leonard: All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to.// Penny: No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!// Sheldon: Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?// Amy: Stop that. Penny is not a liability.// Penny: Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?// Amy: Maybe we pick names out of a hat.// Scene: Penny’s apartment. (Montage with scenes in the apartment and Leonard’s bedroom)// Penny: All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.// Sheldon: Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?// Penny: No.// Sheldon: It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.// Raj (over walkie-talkie): All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.// (over walkie-talkie)// Sheldon: What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.// Penny: Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.// Howard: Wow, you’re really good at puzzles.// Amy: I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.// Howard: If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake.// Amy: I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.// Howard: Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?// Amy: No.// Howard: Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?// Bernadette: Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!// Leonard: Stop yelling at me.// Bernadette: Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.// Penny: Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go.// Sheldon: But we haven’t finished the puzzle.// Penny: But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on.// Sheldon: You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?// Penny: Okay, it’s not gonna say that.// Sheldon: Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.// Howard: It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.// Bernadette: Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.// Penny: It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store.// Sheldon: It’s the comic book store.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Leonard: Do you think Penny’s mad at me?// Bernadette: Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.// Leonard: No, because I didn’t want her on my team.// Bernadette: I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.// Leonard: Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.// Bernadette: Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?// Scene: Howard’s car.// Amy: I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.// Howard: Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?// Amy: Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.// Howard: Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.// Amy: Such as?// Howard: I don’t know. Tell me some things you like.// Amy: Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…// Howard: Hey, how about some music?// Amy: Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member.// Howard: Find something you like.// Amy: Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?// Howard: Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.// Amy: I love Neil Diamond.// Both: Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I’ve been inclined…// Scene: The comic book store.// Raj: Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.// Stuart: Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of.// Raj: Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.// Amy: Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it.// Raj: Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?// Bernadette: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.// Leonard: I have asthma. Back off.// Howard: Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see.// Raj: Good riddle, huh?// Stuart: Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?// Raj: I invited you to my murder mystery party.// Stuart: No, you didn’t.// Raj: Oh.// Penny: Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up.// Sheldon: It is a marathon, not a sprint.// Penny: People run in a marathon.// Sheldon: Not with a bowling ball on their back.// Leonard: Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings.// Bernadette: Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.// Leonard: Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve.// Penny: Riddle me this…// Sheldon: Got it.// Penny: Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.// Sheldon: I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.// Howard: Hey, you know what this could mean (whispers).// (whispers).// Amy: Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be (whispers back)// (whispers back)// Howard: That’s it.// Amy: To the Neil Mobile.// Bernadette: I knew it, we’re gonna lose.// Leonard: Wait, I got it. I got it/// Bernadette: Congratulations, you got it last.// Leonard: You’re really mean, you know that?// Stuart: So no one’s gonna buy anything.// Scene: The geology lab at the University.// Penny: Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.// Sheldon: The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.// Penny: Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?// Sheldon: Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?// Penny: Yes.// Sheldon: Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.// Penny: Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.// Sheldon: And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…// Penny: Shut up. I solved it.// Sheldon: Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.// Penny: Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?// Sheldon: No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.// Howard: On the boats and on the planes.// Amy: They’re coming to America.// Howard: Never looking back again.// Amy: They’re coming to America… ♪// Leonard: Um, I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car.// Bernadette: Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix things.// Leonard: Uh-huh. Like death?// Bernadette (out of the window): Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.// (out of the window)// Leonard: Penny’s not answering my texts.// Bernadette: Who cares? Focus on the game.// Leonard: This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.// Bernadette: No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.// Leonard: Why?// Bernadette: Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.// Leonard: What does she think I am?// Bernadette: How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.// Leonard: I can’t believe she would say that about me.// Bernadette: If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.// Howard: They’re coming to America, They’re coming to America.// Amy: Today!// Howard: Today!// Together: Today! Today!// Scene: Penny’s car.// Sheldon: Okay, another 30 feet.// Penny: Okay. Oh, it’s a bowling alley.// Sheldon: Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody’s.// Scene: The geology lab.// Howard: Love on the rocks.// Amy: Ain’t no big surprise.// Howard: Just pour me a drink.// Amy: And I’ll tell you some lies.// Scene: The apartment stairwell. Leonard is lowering himself down the lift shaft.// Leonard: Call me a lady part. We’ll see about that.// Bernadette: Can you reach the clue?// Leonard: Almost.// Bernadette: Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.// Leonard: Got it.// Bernadette: Great, climb back up. Come on.// Leonard: Yeah, Penny might be onto something.// Sheldon: To the planetarium.// Penny: Let’s go.// Leonard: To the tar pits.// Bernadette: Let’s go.// Amy: There’s a Neil Diamond concert next month.// Howard: Let’s go.// Scene: The laundry room.// Penny: Three bags, no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones here.// Sheldon: It’s dirty laundry. You’re up.// Penny: What? Why me?// Sheldon: Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.// Bernadette: They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.// Penny: Okay, the clue must be in the bag.// Leonard: The clue must be in the bag.// Penny: It’s just a bunch of pants.// Leonard: It’s just a bunch of pants.// Penny: You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team.// Leonard: Well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon.// Penny: What are you talking about?// Leonard: You know exactly what I’m talking about.// Bernadette: No, she doesn’t. I just made that up.// Leonard: Why would you do that?// Bernadette: Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.// Sheldon: I’m not a child. I know the word ninny.// Penny: Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass.// Bernadette: Wish I had a man like her on my team.// Leonard: Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this.// Sheldon: Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt.// Penny: Oh.// Sheldon: Hey, that’s my shirt.// Leonard: This one is, too.// Sheldon: No, no, that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it.// Penny: But wait. So does this one.// Bernadette: Maybe the spot’s the clue.// Penny: Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.// Sheldon: Oh, that’s clever.// Penny (off): Hurry.// (off)// Sheldon: Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.// Scene: The stairwell.// Bernadette: Stop her, Leonard, stop her.// Penny: Well, where the hell’s the coin?// Leonard: Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?// Raj: Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.// Bernadette: Then where’s the coin?// Raj: Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.// Penny: I don’t get it.// Raj: Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner.// Leonard: Are you kidding me?// Penny: That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.// Bernadette: You suck so hard.// Raj: Well, I thought… Come on, I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny.// Penny: Run.// Raj: Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.// Penny: Run to India.// Raj: I just wanted to do something beautiful.// Sheldon (entering): Hey, look. I won.// (entering)// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night.// Howard: Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,// Amy: She got the way to groove me.// Howard: Cherry, baby// Amy: She got the way to move me, honey.// Together: She got the way to groove me. She got the way to move me.// Howard: Cherry// Together: She got the way to groove me, yeah!Series 07 Episode 04 – The Raiders Minimization// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: So what’d you think?// Amy: It was good.// Sheldon: That’s it? Good”// Amy: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.// Sheldon: My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites.// Amy: It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.// Sheldon: Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it.// Amy: All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.// Sheldon: Oh, I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.// Amy: No, I do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The foyer.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.// Leonard: Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?// Penny: Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.// Leonard: You bought my mom’s book?// Penny: Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.// Leonard: Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.// Penny: Oh, cool. Are there pictures?// Leonard: Seriously, please find another book.// Penny: Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?// Leonard: There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it.// Penny: Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?// Leonard: It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.// Penny: Oh, my God, you still go left.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?// Howard: Halle Berry. Why?// Raj: Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure.// Leonard: Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?// Sheldon: I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.// Howard: Because her life wasn’t enough?// Raj: Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.// Sheldon: Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.// All: Aw!// Howard: Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.// Leonard: Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?// Leonard: No.// Penny: I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.// Leonard: They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.// Penny: You were wearing her bra.// Leonard: That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?// Penny: Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.// Leonard: Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.// Penny: Well, why were you so angry?// Leonard: Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.// Penny: Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.// Leonard: I do, too, but there’s not.// Penny: Really? Are you sure about that?// Leonard: Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Stuart: Is make-up really necessary?// Raj: Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.// Stuart: You got it.// Raj: Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you.// Stuart: I don’t think I can give you that.// Raj: Come on. One more time. Yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?// Stuart: Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?// Raj: Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?// Stuart: I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?// Raj: My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?// Stuart: I put: not applicable.// Raj: Come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on.// Stuart: Really? Like what?// Raj: Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business.// Stuart: Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.// Raj: Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?// Stuart: I do have one oddly long testicle.// Raj: Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!// Leonard: Whatcha doin’?// Sheldon: Oh, it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works.// Leonard: So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?// Sheldon: Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.// Leonard: Mm-hmm. And?// Sheldon: And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?// Leonard: Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.// Sheldon: Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes.// Leonard: Sorry, buddy.// Sheldon: Ooh, I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.// Leonard: I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.// Sheldon: Wait, hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?// Leonard: I gotta go.// Leonard: You ready to go?// Penny: Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys.// Leonard: Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?// Penny: Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…// Leonard: Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go.// Penny: Hey, what’s going on with you?// Leonard: Nothing, I’m fine.// Penny: All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?// Leonard: No. Not everything is about my mom.// Penny: ‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go.// Leonard: Except this is totally about my mom.// Penny: I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?// Leonard: That sounds nice. Yeah.// Penny: Okay.// Leonard: Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.// Scene: Leonard’s lab.// Howard: Leonard, you ready for lunch?// Leonard: One sec. Hey. Sorry.// Howard: Hi, Penny.// Penny: Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.// Leonard: I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.// Howard: Wow. Sex at work?// Leonard: Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.// Howard: Sorry.// Leonard: Who just had sex with me at work.// Howard: Damn. How’d you swing that?// Leonard: Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.// Howard: Seriously?// Leonard: Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end.// Howard: You sound kind of proud of it.// Leonard: I am, I’m really proud.// Amy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?// (on webcam)// Sheldon: Yes. Why?// Amy: Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.// Sheldon: April 13, a dark night, indeed.// Amy: So what can I do for you?// Sheldon: I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.// Amy: Really?// Sheldon: Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.// Amy: That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?// Sheldon: Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?// Amy: Of course I’m in.// Sheldon: Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.// Amy: Good night, Dr. Cooper.// Sheldon: Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Bernadette: You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?// Howard: Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.// Bernadette: Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.// Howard: How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.// Bernadette: Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes.// Howard: That’s it? No compassion?// Bernadette: Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath.// Howard: Bernie…// Bernadette: God, what is going on with you?// Howard: I’m sharing my pain.// Bernadette: And I’m not buying it. Try again.// Howard: I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?// Bermadette: Strike two.// Howard: I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.// Bernadette: Howard.// Howard: I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes.// Raj: Three, two, one.// Stuart: That’s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.// Raj: Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!// Stuart: That’s right, ladies. For all you know, I’m confident and fun to be around.// Raj: Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight.// Stuart: If it is, I’ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I’d started this years ago, I’d be divorced two or three times by now.// Raj: What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?// Stuart: Well, they’re not running away screaming, so, no.// Amy: I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.// Sheldon: Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.// Amy: You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.// Sheldon: That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.// Amy: Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge.// Sheldon: Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.// Amy: Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it.// Sheldon: Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.// Amy: I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Amy: Do you feel better?// Sheldon: Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.// Leonard: Hey, I was just… what is happening?// Penny: Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.// Leonard: Oh, oh, I have. So bad.// Penny: And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.// Leonard: Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.// Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.// Leonard: Mom?// Mrs Hofstadter: I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.// Leonard: I… uh…// Penny: Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.// Mrs Hofstadter: Let’s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.// Leonard: Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.// Mrs Hofstadter: When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.// Leonard: I didn’t dream that?// Mrs Hofstadter: How did that make you feel?// Leonard: Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now.// Raj: In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?// Stuart: Combined?// Raj: Yes.// Stuart: Zero.// Raj: Dude, this is, this is brutal.// Stuart: I don’t think I’ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.// Raj: This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.// Stuart: And make them look us in the eye.// Raj: Yeah, anything is better than this.// Scene: A bar.// Raj: Hello.// Girl: Not interested.// Raj: I was wrong. This is worse.// Howard: Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse.// Sheldon: That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.// Raj: Like a hero.// All: Yeah!// Leonard: Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done.Series 07 Episode 05 – The Workplace Proximity// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory// Penny: Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night.// Amy: It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.// Sheldon: Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.// Penny: How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?// Sheldon: If you do that, I’ll scream.// Amy: Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.// Sheldon: That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.// Amy: I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool.// Sheldon: You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win.// Amy: So, you’re okay with this?// Sheldon: Well, why wouldn’t I be?// Amy: Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.// Sheldon: My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?// Amy: Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace.// Sheldon: Really?// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.// Amy: I’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.// Sheldon: Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world, little lady.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Howard: Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.// Sheldon: Why not? Hairy Fairy.// Raj: I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work.// Leonard: Your father’s a gynaecologist.// Raj: I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.// Howard: Would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?// Leonard: No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.// Sheldon: That’s a Raging Ogre.// Leonard: Yeah, I know.// Howard: I’m just saying, I’d never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?// Raj: Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.// Howard: Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.// Sheldon: Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.// Leonard: Please let me be there when you tell her that.// Sheldon: Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?// Leonard: Please, oh, please, just let me be there.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?// Amy: I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.// Bernadette: If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes.// Amy: Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?// Bernadette: You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical.// Penny: You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.// Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny.// (off)// (Knock, knock, knock)// Bernadette: He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?// Amy: I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.// Sheldon: Hi. Um, I’ve reconsidered. Uh, you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.// Amy: Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque.// Sheldon: Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.// Penny: Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.// Sheldon: Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.// Bernadette: He said what?// Sheldon: Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious.// Bernadette: Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?// Amy: No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project.// Penny: Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do.// Sheldon: Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public.// Penny: That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.// Amy: Sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. I’ll be in a different building. And we don’t even have to have lunch together.// Amy: Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.// Sheldon: Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?// Amy: More and more sure.// Sheldon: Well, then, you have my permission.// Amy: I didn’t ask for your permission.// Sheldon: Too late. No backsies.// Howard: No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around.// Sheldon: Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway.// Bernadette: Well?// Howard: Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it’s true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other.// Sheldon: Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.// Howard: For the love of God, why?// Bernadette: What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?// Raj: His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.// Howard: It’s nothing in particular. I…// Bernadette: Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?// Howard: My arm is feeling numb.// Leonard: Nailed it.// Bernadette: That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus.// Howard: My point is, I’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long.// Bernadette: Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?// Howard: Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?// Bernadette: Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.// Howard: Bernie…// Sheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Leonard: So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?// Raj: It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.// Howard: Please, stop talking.// Raj: As you wish.// Howard: I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t tried to help you.// Sheldon: Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.// Amy: Gentlemen.// Raj: Amy.// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: That was kind of icy. You two okay?// Sheldon: Oh, we’re fine. As Howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries.// Leonard: Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.// Sheldon: Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry, little moth. The flame will come to you.// Raj: Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?// Howard: I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy.// Raj: That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.// Amy: And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.// Sheldon: Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?// Amy: Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?// Sheldon: Oh, please, I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: It’s a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?// Scene: Amy’s lab.// Amy: Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking.// Sheldon: Dr. Fowler?// Amy: What do you want, Sheldon?// Sheldon: Well, I’m done with work, so… ugh!// Amy: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?// Sheldon: Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?// Amy: Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.// Sheldon: So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.// Amy: I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor.// Sheldon: What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.// Amy: You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.// Sheldon: Aw. Embarrassed you?// Amy: You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home.// Sheldon: I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.// Amy: Really? What tipped you off?// Sheldon: Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…// Amy: Get out.// Sheldon: Well, now, that.// Amy: Image number six, woman giving birth.// Sheldon: Bleugh!// Leonard: It’s nine o’clock, where you been?// Sheldon: Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.// Penny: Oh, no.// Sheldon: Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?// Leonard: I did not.// Sheldon: Well, I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.// Penny: Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.// Sheldon: I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem.// Leonard: I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.// Sheldon: Yeah, I thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice.// Penny: Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?// Sheldon: Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?// Penny: Yeah.// Sheldon: But you didn’t even hear the details.// Leonard: Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong.// Sheldon: But you don’t even know…// Leonard: Doesn’t matter.// Sheldon: But, now, but in my defence…// Sheldon: You’re not listening to my side of it.// Penny: Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?// Sheldon: Well…// Penny: Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Howard: Ooh, shrimp was spicy.// Raj: You want a TUMS?// Howard: You got the tropical fruit kind?// Raj: No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.// Howard: Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk. (Knock on door) I’ll get it.// (Knock on door)// Raj: Thanks.// Bernadette: Hi.// Howard: Oh, hi.// Bernadette: I may have overreacted.// Howard: Yeah, well, I didn’t handle it so great, either.// Bernadette: It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.// Howard: That’s not true.// Bernadette: It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings.// Howard: Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I’m so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority.// Bernadette: Why tomorrow?// Howard: Well, we’re real close to finishing off the new Batman game.// Raj: It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.// Howard: Should I go after you?// Bernadette (off): No!// Howard: Thanks for getting me in trouble.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.// Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?// Sheldon: I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?// Amy: No.// Sheldon: Well, I cannot give this stuff away.// Amy: What do you want?// Sheldon: Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.// Amy: Sheldon, you’re not a weirdo.// Sheldon: I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.// Amy: What’s your point?// Sheldon: My point is, we’re a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.// Amy: I like you, too.// Sheldon: Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it.// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar.// Bernadette: I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.// Amy: Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him.// Penny: All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.// Leonard: Laser’s warmed up.// Howard: Pull.// All: Yeah!Series 07 Episode 06 – The Romance Resonance// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory// Penny: What are you working on?// Sheldon: Can’t talk. In the zone.// Penny: Do you know what he’s doing?// Amy: Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut.// Penny: Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s ready.// Leonard: No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.// Howard: Sorry we’re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.// Bernadette: Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.// Raj: Why is that great news?// Bernadette: In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money.// Howard: Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.// Bernadette: Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead already.// Howard: Guys, listen up.// Sheldon: Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care.// Howard: Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.// Sheldon: Really don’t care.// Howard: I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.// Penny: Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?// Howard: Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.// Penny: Ah.// Howard: Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.// Leonard: Aw.// Amy: Oh, I love that.// Raj: That is so beautiful.// Howard: Sheldon?// Sheldon: When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?// Credits sequence// Scene: The stairwell// Leonard: It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.// Penny: Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?// Leonard: Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?// Sheldon: Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.// Leonard: And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?// Penny: I can name tons.// Leonard: Sex doesn’t count.// Penny: Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?// Leonard: Well, I took you there. All you did was…// Penny: I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.// Leonard: It’s fine. And also not true.// Penny: Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off.// Leonard: That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?// Penny: Sheldon?// Sheldon: Zone.// Leonard: He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something.// Sheldon: Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.// Leonard: Nope, it was better before.// Sheldon: Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.// Leonard: Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?// Sheldon: Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…// Leonard: Yeah, definitely better before.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Howard: So I’m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?// Leonard: If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello.// Howard: Great. Will you play the ukulele?// Raj: Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.// Howard: Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.// Raj: Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.// Sheldon: Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.// Howard: Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.// Raj: Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.// Sheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.// Leonard: Sheldon, that’s incredible.// Sheldon: Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.// Howard: So, what happens next?// Sheldon: Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been.// Leonard: Good to know.// Sheldon: Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Thank you so much for coming.// Raj: You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.// Penny: Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this.// Raj: As I’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…// Penny: Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count.// Raj: Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach.// Penny: I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?// Raj: Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.// Penny: Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head.// Raj: Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.// Penny: That’s from Say Anything.// Raj: Look, I’m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.// Penny: I get that, but why is this so hard?// Raj: Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.// Penny: Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t.// Sheldon: Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.// Amy: I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker.// Sheldon: And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.// Amy: Sheldon, I’m so proud of you.// Sheldon: Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.// Amy: What’s next?// Sheldon: This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…// Amy: And what?// Sheldon: No. No, no, no, no.// Amy: What’s wrong?// Sheldon: I’ve made a horrible mistake.// Amy: What are you talking about?// Sheldon: This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?// Amy: That Americans can’t handle the metric system?// Sheldon: Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.// Amy: But the Chinese team found the element.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about.// Amy: So you just got lucky?// Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.// Amy: You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking.// Sheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud.// Amy: You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.// Sheldon: Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Leonard:: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.// Sheldon: There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve.// Leonard: Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you.// Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing.// Leonard: Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.// Sheldon: You know, frankly, I’d prefer a sex tape.// Leonard: You don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?// Sheldon: No.// Howard: Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want to blow the surprise.// Leonard: We’ll be there.// Raj: Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.// Howard: E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.// Raj: Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.// Leonard: I will not.// Raj: Oh, please?// Howard: No, I want this to be romantic.// Raj: It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I’m referring to you.// Voice: There he is. (General applause)// (General applause)// Sheldon: Stop it. Stop celebrating me.// Voice: Woo!// Sheldon: And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.// Raj: Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?// Sheldon: Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?// (More applause)// Leonard: Invite them to live with us.// Scene: A restaurant.// Penny: Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.// Leonard: Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.// Penny: Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face.// Leonard: Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count.// Howard: I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call and check on her.// Sheldon: The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.// Raj: Oh, that’s a big deal.// Sheldon: I know. When will this nightmare end?// Leonard: Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you.// Amy: I’m not.// Sheldon: You’re not?// Amy: Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you.// Sheldon: That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.// Penny: Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me.// Sheldon: Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.// Howard: Guys, there was an accident at Bernie’s lab.// Leonard: Oh, my God, is she okay?// Howard: Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine.// Penny: What?// Amy: Poor Bernadette.// Leonard: Oh, no.// Sheldon: I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.// Scene: The hospital.// Howard: Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?// Bernadette: Well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips.// Howard: You’re sure you’re okay?// Bernadette: Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.// Howard: Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.// Bernadette: What’s all this?// Howard: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.// Bernadette: Howie.// Amy: Sheldon, get over here.// Sheldon: She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?// Amy: Sheldon.// Howard (singing): If I didn’t have you, life would be blue, I’d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.// (singing)// Sheldon: Is it me, or does she not look so good?// Amy: Shh.// Howard: A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom.// All: And he’d probably still live with his mom.// Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.// Bernadette: Oh, Howie.// Howard: If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam.// All: And he’d definitely still live with his mom.// Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.// All: Oh, we couldn’t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.// Bernadette: Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking.// Sheldon: She’s sick, I knew it. Bye.// Leonard: I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever made.// Penny: I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.// Leonard: Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.// Penny: Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why.// Leonard: Oh, rose petals.// Penny: Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.// Leonard: You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.// Penny: Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.// Leonard: Oh, wow.// Penny: It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.// Leonard: This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much.// Leonard: Nothing. I love it.// Penny: No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.// Leonard: It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.// Penny: Oh, my God, I am the worst.// Leonard: No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful.// Penny: No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.// Leonard: I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.// Penny: Of course I did. It’s you.// Leonard: Come here.// Penny: Oh.// Leonard: Is that a pregnancy test?// Penny: Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all.// Sheldon: I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.// Amy: Me? What did I do?// Sheldon: You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you.// Amy: Sorry.// Sheldon: Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.// Amy: Oh, Sheldon.// Sheldon (not in Amy’s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?// (not in Amy’s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory)// Amy: Can’t talk, in the zone.Series 07 Episode 07 – The Proton Displacement// Scene: A supermarket// Amy: I’ve never seen him this happy before.// Leonard: That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.// Sheldon: Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash.// Leonard: Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.// Sheldon: Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?// Leonard: Oh, yeah.// Sheldon: Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello.// Leonard: Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him.// Sheldon: I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him.// Leonard: He thinks there’s a difference.// Sheldon: Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.// Arthur: Trust me, I, I remember.// Sheldon: This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.// Arthur: Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?// Amy: Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity.// Arthur: Oh, okay, I get it now.// Leonard: Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.// Arthur: Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?// Leonard: No, she’s not.// Sheldon: So, what prescription are you getting filled?// Leonard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me.// Arthur: I wasn’t going to tell you.// Amy: Sheldon, come on.// Sheldon: No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?// Arthur: Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess.// Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.// Sheldon: But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.// Credits sequence.// The cafeteria.// Howard: Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?// Raj: Actually, I’m busy.// Howard: Doing what?// Raj: There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…// Howard: You’re going to girls’ night.// Raj: Yeah.// Howard: You know they’re making jewellery right?// Raj: You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.// Leonard: What’s up?// Howard: Not his testosterone levels.// Raj: Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.// Howard: How is that possible?// Leonard: Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.// Sheldon: Goody. What’s it say?// Leonard: He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it.// Sheldon: That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.// Howard: You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.// Raj: Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about.// Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not cry.// Howard: It’s true, you’d rust.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.// Amy: Is it really worth getting upset about?// Sheldon: Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.// Amy: Come on, he’s a retired kids show host.// Sheldon: That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.// Amy: Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?// Sheldon: Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.// Amy: Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.// Sheldon: That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it.// Amy: From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…// Sheldon: What?// Amy: Doesn’t matter.// Sheldon: No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Amy: This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.// Raj: Penny, how’s it going over there?// Penny: Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.// Amy: How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?// Penny: Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.// Howard: Hello, everyone.// Raj: Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.// Howard: Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.// Raj: Thank you.// Howard: So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.// Bernadette: Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.// Howard: Oh, that’s actually pretty nice.// Amy: I’m making a bracelet.// Penny: Yeah, I’m just making a mess.// Howard: You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff.// Raj: Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you.// Amy: Actually, I’d kind of like to try that.// Bernadette: Me, too.// Howard: Be right back.// Penny: When did I have pistachios?// Scene: Professor Proton’s house.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Arthur: Sheldon, what are you doing here?// Sheldon: I’m sorry, did I wake you?// Arthur: Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty.// Sheldon: Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.// Arthur: What do you want, Sheldon?// Sheldon: It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.// Arthur: She sounds like a keeper.// Sheldon: Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.// Arthur: All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.// Sheldon: No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.// Arthur: Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.// Sheldon: Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.// Arthur: I should be so lucky.// Sheldon: So, uh, what do you say?// Arthur: You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.// Sheldon: It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.// Arthur: Good night.// Sheldon: Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it.// Arthur: You’re annoying.// Sheldon: Well, that really hurt.// Scene: Leonard’s laboratory.// Leonard: If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.// Arthur: If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.// Leonard: I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting.// Sheldon: Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.// Leonard: Why is it odd?// Sheldon: Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.// Bill Nye: Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.// Arthur: That’s what I told my lawyers.// Leonard: Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.// Bill: He said I’d be speaking to a class.// Sheldon: No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.// Bill: What are you guys working on?// Leonard: Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes.// Bill: Oh, that’s interesting.// Arthur: Haven’t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Hey, guys, what do you think?// Amy: Wow, Penny, good job.// Penny: Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.// Amy: What are you working on?// Raj: Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom.// Amy: That’s sweet.// Raj: Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.// Penny: What’s going on with them?// Raj: They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.// Bernadette: Hi.// Penny: Hey, guys.// Amy: Hello.// Howard: Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.// Bernadette: Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.// Howard: Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.// Raj: I didn’t know you were coming again.// Howard: Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.// Penny (laughing): It was not funny.// (laughing)// Amy: So, what tools did you bring?// Howard: Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.// Penny: Ooh, that looks like fun.// Bernadette: Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.// Howard: Okay, who’s up first?// Amy: Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?// Raj: No, thanks.// Howard: I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet.// Leonard: Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.// Arthur: This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again.// Leonard: Oh, God.// Arthur: What, what is it?// Leonard: Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.// Arthur: Can, can I ask you a question?// Leonard: Yeah, sure.// Arthur: Why do you put up with Sheldon?// Leonard: Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends.// Arthur: Why?// Leonard: Wow, you ask really hard questions.// Arthur: Yeah.// Leonard: Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.// Arthur: You, you know you’re describing a dog.// Leonard: He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…// Arthur: Yeah, they, they hate that.// Leonard: You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.// Arthur: Why, why is that?// Leonard: Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.// Arthur: Another photo from Sheldon?// Leonard: No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.// Arthur: He probably stole his wallet, too.// Howard: You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.// Penny: Oh, that’s amazing,// Howard: Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.// Bernadette: He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger.// Raj: My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.// Howard: Whoa, where is that coming from?// Raj: I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.// Penny: Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.// Howard: How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.// Raj: But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.// Howard: Since when can’t you open up with me?// Raj: There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.// Howard: Buddy, I was just joking around.// Raj: Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.// Howard: You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.// Raj: Thank you. It wasn’t easy.// Amy: They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.// Sheldon: Arthur?// Arthur: Hi, Sheldon.// Sheldon: I’m surprised to see you here.// Arthur: Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.// Sheldon: I’ll get Leonard.// Arthur: No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you.// Sheldon: If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.// Arthur: No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.// Sheldon: Thank you. It would be an honour.// Arthur: Oh. Uh, great.// Sheldon: Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.// Arthur: And, what did you think?// Sheldon: Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.// Arthur: Mmm. Thank you.// Sheldon: Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.// Arthur: Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.// Sheldon: Can I invite you in for tea?// Arthur: Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.// Penny: Hey, Arthur. How are you?// Arthur: Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt.// Howard: Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?// Raj: Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.// Howard: You didn’t have to do that.// Raj: Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.// Howard: Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.// Raj: Oh gets better.// Howard: Wow.// Raj: And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.// Sheldon: Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?// Leonard: He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.// Sheldon: Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.// Arthur: So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?// Penny: Sorry, they’re both married.// Arthur: Good.// Penny: Mmm.// Arthur: Hap, hap, happily?Series 07 Episode 08 – The Itchy Brain Simulation// Scene: The apartment// Penny: Hey, can I ask you a question?// Leonard: Sure.// Penny: You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but I’ve never seen you play.// Leonard: Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.// Penny: What window?// Leonard: That one over there.// Sheldon: Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?// Leonard: Skee-Ball tickets?// Sheldon: Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.// Leonard: Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box.// Penny: Ooh, what are you gonna get?// Sheldon: None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.// Leonard: Yup, oh, here you go.// Sheldon: Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.// Leonard: Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.// Penny: Aw, did she hate you?// Leonard: Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.// Sheldon: I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?// Leonard: Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there.// Sheldon: Well, you barely looked. Let me see.// Leonard: No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets.// Sheldon: Leonard, let me look in the box.// Leonard: Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.// Sheldon: Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider.// Penny: No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out.// Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?// Sheldon: That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?// Leonard: I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it.// Sheldon: Okay.// Leonard: I mean it, I’m going to.// Sheldon: I believe you.// Leonard: And you’re going to stay calm?// Sheldon: I said I would.// Leonard: How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.// Penny: Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet.// Sheldon: Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch.// Leonard: When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?// Sheldon: You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.// Leonard: Well, I don’t know how to do that.// Sheldon: How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.// Leonard: That’s stupid. Why?// Sheldon: You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.// Leonard: I’m telling you, try the hanger.// Sheldon: Put it on. Let’s share the experience.// Leonard: You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.// Sheldon: Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.// Leonard: Really?// Sheldon: How those nipples feeling, chief?// Scene: The cheesecake factory bar.// Bernadette: Penny, can we please get our drinks?// Penny: Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.// Amy: At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.// Bernadette: Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.// Penny: I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.// Amy: Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart.// Bernadette: That’s Lucy?// Penny: I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.// Bernadette: I think that reason’s called racism.// Penny: I’m gonna go talk to her.// Bernadette: Why? What are you gonna say?// Penny: I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?// Bernadette: You because you just called him your Indian friend.// Penny: Yeah, well, you’re short.// Amy: We’re never getting our drinks.// Bernadette: No, but we knew that.// Penny: Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?// Lucy: Oh, water would be great.// Penny: Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you.// Lucy: Wow. How’s he doing?// Penny: Oh, you know, he’s good.// Lucy: Great.// Penny: Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?// Lucy: Oh, I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be easier.// Penny: Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him.// Lucy: Any chance I can get a different waitress?// Penny: I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?// Lucy: I don’t know your e-mail.// Penny: You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess.// Lucy: Oh, I thought you said he was okay.// Penny: Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?// Howard: So, you can never take it off?// Leonard: No.// Raj: Not even to sleep?// Howard: So, you’re just an idiot?// Leonard: It’s called proving a point.// Howard: Is the point that you’re an idiot?// Sheldon: Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.// Raj: So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?// Leonard: Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!// Howard: And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.// Raj: I don’t get it.// Howard: You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?// Raj: No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.// Howard: You had to be taught not to play with cobras?// Raj: You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?// Bernadette: We did, you never brought it.// Penny: Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club.// Amy: Not even close.// Penny: Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.// Amy: You want to say sorry.// Bernadette: So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?// Penny: What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?// Amy: You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.// Bernadette: Then you made her cry and leave.// Penny: Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.// Scene: The same, later.// Raj: What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. (Phone text sound) It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.// (Phone text sound)// Scene: Sheldon’s office.// Howard: Hey, what’re you working on?// Sheldon: I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.// Howard: That’s a pretty cool idea.// Sheldon: Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.// Howard: Sure.// Sheldon: This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?// Leonard: Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.// Howard: You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin.// Leonard: Or it’s resolved.// Sheldon: Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.// Howard: I believe this is yours.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Raj: Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?// Howard: You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence.// Raj: Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?// Bernadette: If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?// Howard: Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.// Raj: He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.// Bernadette: Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens.// Raj: Well, can I say she looks nice?// Bernadette: Sure.// Raj: Can I tell her I miss her?// Bernadette: Maybe, if she asks.// Raj: Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?// Bernadette: I’d save that for the second date.// Raj: Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.// Penny: What are you doing?// Leonard: Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me.// Penny: Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?// Leonard: There’s a principle at stake.// Penny: Which is?// Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me.// Penny: Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell.// Leonard: No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.// Penny: Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins.// Leonard: No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.// Penny: Smile.// Leonard: What is that? What is that for?// Penny: So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.// Amy: I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.// Sheldon: I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.// Amy: Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?// Sheldon: The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?// Amy: I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?// Sheldon: There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.// Amy: Seriously?// Sheldon: Please. Ha-ha, Oh.// Scene: A coffee shop.// Lucy: Hi.// Raj: Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you.// Lucy: You, too.// Raj: Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?// Lucy: I’m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.// Raj: Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.// Lucy: Okay.// Raj: I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.// Lucy: Oh, uh, I’m kind of seeing someone.// Raj: I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?// Raj: This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?// Penny: There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.// Raj: I love you, Penny.// Sheldon: How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?// Amy: I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?// Sheldon: There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.// Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.// Sheldon: Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?// Leonard: Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?// Sheldon: Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.// Leonard: Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.// Sheldon: You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.// Leonard: Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?// Sheldon: Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.// Sheldon: I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.// Leonard: Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!// Amy: Sheldon, that was diabolical.// Sheldon: I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?// Raj: Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.// Girl: Well, I don’t.// Raj: I don’t believe you, you’re lying to me.// Girl: What?// Raj: Oh, it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.// Scene: The cheesecake factory.// Girl (to Penny): What is wrong with you?// (to Penny)// Penny (to Raj): What is wrong with you?// (to Raj)// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj (to a mirror): What is wrong with you?// (to a mirror)Series 07 Episode 09 – The Thanksgiving Decoupling// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: The math is all there. It’s not real.// Penny: Yes, it is.// Sheldon: Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it.// Raj: It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.// Penny: Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.// Raj: Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.// Penny: Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.// Leonard: Were you drunk?// Penny: I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?// Leonard: I think you’re the one who fell over.// Penny: That would explain why the sky was also on its side.// Howard: Hey.// Penny: Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?// Howard: Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.// Sheldon: Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.// Howard: Come on, it’ll be fun.// Penny: Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.// Howard: Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.// Sheldon: Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.// Leonard: It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.// Sheldon: Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?// Leonard: I want to go.// Penny: Yeah, me, too.// Raj: I’m in.// Howard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you.// Credits sequence.// Sheldon: Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?// Amy: We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.// Sheldon: Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.// Amy: Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?// Sheldon: Yes.// Penny: Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.// Leonard: You did?// Penny: Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.// Leonard: Wait, you went to a chapel?// Penny: Yeah.// Leonard: Why?// Penny: We had one of those silly fake weddings.// Leonard: Penny, you know those are real, right?// Penny: No, they’re not.// Leonard: Yeah, they are.// Sheldon: He’s right.// Amy: They’re real.// Penny: But it didn’t seem real.// Sheldon: Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Bernadette: Hi, Dad.// Mike: Hi, honey.// Bernadette: Oh, you brought beer for everybody.// Mike: Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.// Bernadette: You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, the medicine’s not working.// (off)// Howard (off): You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. (entering) Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.// (entering)// Mike: Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?// Howard: Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): How can one little toe hurt so bad?// Howard: Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.// Bernadette: I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.// Howard: I have a better idea.// Bernadette: If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.// Howard: I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.// Bernadette: Oh, well, that’s a great idea.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Amy: No traffic, we’re sailing.// Sheldon: Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.// Amy: Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.// Sheldon: Yes, Miss Amy.// Leonard: I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.// Penny: Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.// Leonard: Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.// Penny: I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?// Sheldon: Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.// Penny: So how do I undo this?// Leonard: I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.// Penny: Great, well, what do I have to do?// Amy: It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?// Sheldon: Hah!Penny? Next.// Amy: Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?// Penny: Want of understanding? What does that even mean?// Amy: Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s kitchen.// Bernadette: Thanks for saving the day.// Raj: Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?// Howard: Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.// Bernadette: I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?// Howard: He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.// Bernadette: Don’t be silly, he loves you.// Howard: Does he?// Bernadette: Okay, he cares about you a lot.// Howard: Really?// Scene: The living room.// Bernadette: I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.// Howard: So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?// Mike: Uh-huh.// Howard: You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.// Amy: Happy Thanksgiving.// Sheldon: It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…// Amy: Sheldon.// Penny: Here. Thank you for having us.// Howard: What’s with you?// Leonard: Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.// Howard: Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.// Penny: I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.// Scene: The kitchen.// Amy: You need any help?// Raj: Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?// Amy: Uh, sure.// Raj: Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.// Amy: Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?// Together: What?// Howard: You ever play football?// Mike: A little in college. You?// Howard: No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.// Leonard: Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.// Penny: Fine.// Leonard: And we can just put this whole thing behind us.// Penny: Are you done?// Leonard: What?// Penny: Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?// Leonard: Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.// Penny: Ugh, I need some air.// Leonard: Wuh, Penny.// Sheldon: I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.// Mike: Listen to Stretch.// Leonard: How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.// Howard: Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.// Mike: I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?// Leonard: Sure.// Mike: I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?// Sheldon: They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.// Mike: How the hell do you know that?// Sheldon: My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.// Penny: Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.// Leonard: Wait, you invited him here?// Mike: I’m getting ready to weigh in again.// Leonard: Come on.// Mike: What do you think they ought to do now?// Sheldon: I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.// Howard: Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say blintz?// Scene: The dining room.// Leonard: I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.// Penny: Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…// Raj: Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.// Penny: Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.// Raj: No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.// Leonard: Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.// Bernadette: What?// Amy: Ooh!// Raj: My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.// Sheldon: I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.// Howard: That’s why I sit.// Mike: Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?// Sheldon: 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.// Mike: I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.// Sheldon: So was my dad. And then he did.// Howard: Anyone need a beer?// Mike: Yeah.// Howard: Thank God.// Mike: So, does your dad still live in Texas?// Sheldon: No. He died when I was 14.// Mike: I’m sorry to hear that.// Sheldon: So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.// Howard: Here you go.// Mike: Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.// Sheldon: No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.// Mike: Well, you’re having one with me.// Sheldon: All right.// Mike: To your dad.// Howard: I never had a beer with my dad, either.// Sheldon: Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.// Amy: I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.// Raj: Wonder what she saw in that guy.// Bernadette: I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome.// Amy: Broad shoulders, good hair.// Raj: Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.// Bernadette: How’s it going out there?// Howard: Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.// Amy: I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.// Bernadette: What are they doing?// Howard: They’re drinking beer and watching football.// Bernadette: So why don’t you do that with them?// Howard: They don’t want me.// Bernadette: What do you mean?// Howard: Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…// Amy: Zack’s here!// Raj: Stir the gravy.// Bernadette: Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.// Leonard: Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.// Zack: It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family.// Penny: Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?// Leonard: Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.// Penny: Okay.// Zack: I don’t know if I want to sign it.// Raj, Bernadette and Amy: Ooh.// Leonard: Why won’t you sign it?// Zack: I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.// Penny: We don’t have any kids.// Zack: Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.// Penny: Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.// Zack: Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.// Leonard: You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.// Penny: Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.// Leonard: That is not true.// Penny: Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.// Leonard: You’re the one who invited him here.// Penny: Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face.// Zack: Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.// Leonard: Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.// Zack: Oh, no. Are you dying?// Penny: I’m about to. Sign the paper.// Zack: Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let’s eat.// Sheldon (burping): Two, three, eight, four, six. (Normal) That’s all I can do without throwing up.// (burping)// (Normal)// Mike: That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did somebody say pie?// Mike: I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.// Sheldon: All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.// Mike: Me, too.// Bernadette: Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.// Sheldon: She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.// Amy: All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.// Sheldon: Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.// Bernadette: It’s okay.// Howard: Don’t worry about it.// Amy: Thank you.// Sheldon: Ain’t she great?// Mike: Mmm.// Sheldon: Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?// Bernadette: Thanks again for cooking.// Amy: Yeah, everything was delicious.// Raj: Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.// Mike: Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?// Sheldon: This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say pigskin?// Penny: Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.// Leonard: I’m sorry, too.// Zack: Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.// Mike: I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.// Howard: Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.// Mike: Well, I’m drunk.// Sheldon: I just vomited on a lot of clowns.Series 07 Episode 10 – The Discovery Dissipation// Scene: A radio studio.// Ira Flatow: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.// Sheldon: Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.// Ira: So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.// Sheldon: Yes.// Ira: And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.// Sheldon: Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz.// Ira: It’s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.// Sheldon: Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?// Ira: That’s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn’t that be unusual? Because you’re a physicist.// Sheldon: Yes, yes, I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don’t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.// Sheldon: President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one’s worth a dollar.// Amy: I know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.// Leonard: Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.// Penny: How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon.// Sheldon: Look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.// Sheldon: But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.// Penny: Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Bernadette: Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?// Howard: I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.// Bernadette: Come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here.// Howard: Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he’s seen worse.// Bernadette: Howie.// Howard: I promise I’ll help out the rest of the week.// Bernadette: The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.// Howard: Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?// Bernadette: No.// Howard: Then you left me no choice.// Bernadette: I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest.// Howard: I know, but they’re tenting his building. He can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.// Bernadette: He’s bringing Cinnamon?// Howard: For a whole week, the nerve of some people.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon is playing with his train set.// Sheldon: Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub.// Amy: Sheldon, can I come in?// Sheldon: Do you have cookies?// Amy: No.// Sheldon: Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?// Wil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. It’s been a while.// Sheldon: Why are you here?// Wil: Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?// Sheldon: Certainly. Although, right now, I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque.// Amy: Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.// Wil: Yeah, I know a little something about that.// Sheldon: Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.// Wil: I remember why it’s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.// Sheldon: How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?// Wil: Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.// Sheldon: That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.// Amy: Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.// Wil: Yeah, I’m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.// Amy: Uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so…// Wil: I’m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher’s shadow. But now, it’s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it’s a part that I’m happy is there.// Sheldon: I do see what you’re saying. That helps.// Wil: Good.// Sheldon: Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?// Wil: Sure.// Amy: Okay.// Sheldon: Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.// Wil:Can I blow the whistle?// Sheldon: You should probably go.// Howard: You’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?// Raj: No, I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth.// Howard: Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.// Raj: And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth.// Bernadette: Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have dinner?// Howard: No, we were waiting for you.// Bernadette: Aw, that’s so sweet.// Howard: Yeah. So what do you feel like making?// Raj: Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner.// Bermadette: Oh, Raj, you’re our guest.// Raj: Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.// Howard: No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.// Bernadette: Thank you, Raj.// Raj: Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.// Bernadette: Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ’cause I was stuck in traffic.// Howard: Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.// Raj: Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.// Howard: I thought of you the whole time.// Raj: All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen.// Bernadette: Thank you.// Raj: There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.// Leonard: Hey, you’re in a good mood.// Sheldon: I’m in a great mood.// Leonard: Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.// Sheldon: Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.// Leonard: Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.// Sheldon: Really?// Leonard: Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.// Sheldon: So no more interviews?// Leonard: No, it’s all over.// Sheldon: I can’t believe it.// Leonard: Well, you’re welcome.// Sheldon: You robbed me of my greatest achievement.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too.// Leonard: I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.// Sheldon: By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.// Leonard: Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other.// Sheldon: That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,// Penny: Hey, what’s with all the yelling?// Sheldon: Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.// Penny: Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled,// Sheldon: That’s it, I’m down to seven friends.// Penny: He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?// Sheldon: When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.// Leonard: The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.// Sheldon: Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight.// Leonard: Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.// Penny: Actually, I get what he’s saying.// Sheldon: Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.// Penny: It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.// Sheldon: I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree.// Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does.// Sheldon: No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.// Leonard: Fine, I’ll publish.// Sheldon: Can you believe this guy?// Bernadette: Aw! Raj did the dishes.// Howard: How do you know I didn’t do them?// Bernadette: Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.// Raj: Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha.// Bernadette: Aw, you didn’t have to do that.// Raj: Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great.// Howard: Yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park.// Bernadette: What presentation do I have today?// Howard: Just go.// Raj: He loves you.// Howard: What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?// Raj: I’m just being a good house guest.// Howard: No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?// Raj: Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.// Howard: I don’t want coffee.// Raj: That’s why I got you hot chocolate.// Howard: Give me that. Just stop showing me up.// Raj: Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.// Howard: Um, is this getting weird?// Raj: Hang on.// Howard: So, yes.// Scene: Sheldon’s office.// Leonard: Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.// Sheldon: I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.// Leonard: These things happen all the time, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.// Barry: Thew he is. It’s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.// Leonard: Come on, don’t give him a hard time.// Barry: I’m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.// Leonard: It’s not a big deal.// Barry: It’s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn’t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.// Leonard: Okay, Barry, that’s enough.// Sheldon: No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy.// Barry: Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That’s pwetty hurtful. I, I can’t contwol it.// Sheldon: You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.// Barry: Of course you do. Because you’re the Wetwactor.// Bernadette: Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.// Raj: Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.// Bernadette: Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?// Howard: What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?// Bernadette: Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.// Howard: Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.// Bernadette: Oh, really?// Howard: Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ’em.// Bernadette: Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em.// Howard: I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them.// Raj: Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.// Bernadette: This is stupid. Why are we fighting?// Howard: I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband.// Bernadette: You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.// Howard: Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him.// Raj: Oh, what did I do?// Howard: You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.// Bernadette: Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.// Raj: Look, I’m sorry you’re upset with me, but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page.// Howard: Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.// Bernadette: I back you up all the time.// Howard: That is not… he’s doing it again.// Bernadette: What is wrong with you?// Leonard: I can’t believe they kicked you out.// Raj: I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again.// Penny: Bark once if you need me to call PETA.// Sheldon: What’s that animal doing in our apartment?// Leonard: Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out.// Sheldon: I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.// Penny: You know, if it makes you feel any better…// Sheldon: It probably won’t.// Penny: You’re probably right.// Amy: Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?// Sheldon: Oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?// Raj: Sheldon, I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.// Amy: Thank you, Rajesh.// Raj: And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.// Amy: You should probably go.// Scene: The radio studio.// Ira: I’m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I’d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.// Leonard: Thanks.// Sheldon: Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.// Ira: It’s all right.// Sheldon: Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?// Ira: No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?// Leonard: Well…// Sheldon: I believe I can answer that.// Leonard: He asked me.// Sheldon: Fine.// Leonard: As I was saying…// Sheldon: You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…// Leonard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium.// Ira: You know, I’d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it’s okay with you.// Sheldon: What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?// Ira: Actually, I didn’t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I’m not comfortable with confrontation.// Leonard: Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.// Sheldon: Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.// Penny (listening in her apartment): You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.// (listening in her apartment)// Amy: A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?// Sheldon: You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)// (Does)// Amy: I’ll get the vodka.Series 07 Episode 11 – The Cooper Extraction// Scene: The apartment. Penny and Amy are playing a ski-ing game.// Penny: Wow, you’re really good at this.// Amy: Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I’m like a pyramid.// Penny: How you doing over there?// Leonard: Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.// Penny: Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?// Sheldon: Oh, I would, but I’m on my way out.// Leonard: Where?// Sheldon: Texas.// Amy: Right now? Why?// Leonard: Is someone sick?// Sheldon: Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.// Penny: Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.// Sheldon: No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.// Amy: How come you never said she was pregnant?// Sheldon: Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?// Leonard: Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister.// Sheldon: Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.// Penny: Wow, so, how long will you be gone?// Sheldon: Well, she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?// Amy: Can I give you a ride to the airport?// Sheldon: Oh, no, thank you, I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: All right, here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.// Penny: Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.// Leonard: And I’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.// Penny: Ah.// Raj: Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?// Leonard: I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. (All whoop)// (All whoop)// Howard: I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun.// Raj: Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack.// Bernadette: Good idea, I’ll take a picture.// Penny: Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.// Leonard: I love it.// Penny: Okay.// Leonard: But it is what you got me last year.// Penny: Yeah.// Leonard: And last night.// Stuart: Hello.// Various: Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc// Stuart: Oh, good, I’m glad you guys didn’t wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it’s, it’s seven, but that’s fine.// Amy (ringing from tablet): Oh, it’s probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody’s here, say hi.// (ringing from tablet)// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Hey, buddy.// Raj: Hey.// Howard: Howdy.// Bernadette: Hi.// Sheldon: The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?// Amy: Yeah, kinda.// Sheldon: That’s so thoughtful. You guys are the best.// Penny: Hey, how’s your sister?// Sheldon: <i>She went into labor an hour ago.// Amy: That’s wonderful. So you’re at the hospital?// Sheldon: No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn’t available.// Raj: You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.// Sheldon: And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.// Mrs Cooper (off): Shelly, come on. Your sister’s fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there’s blood everywhere.// (off)// Sheldon: Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.// Raj: If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?// Penny: Yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby, I’ll give you ten dollars.// Bernadette: Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.// Amy: Oh, I love that movie.// Raj: I’ve never seen it.// Stuart: Me neither.// Amy: It’s great. It’s Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.// Stuart: Don’t need to see it. Living it.// Bernadette: But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born.// Penny: Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?// Leonard: (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Amy: You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, I don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.// Howard: Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I’m in this room.// Amy: It’s true. None of you would know me. You wouldn’t know Bernadette. You wouldn’t be dating Penny.// Leonard: You don’t know that. I’ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up. (General laughter)// (General laughter)// Penny: Oh, you weren’t joking.// Leonard: No.// Penny: Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.// Fantasy sequence in Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.// Howard: I’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen.// Raj: Maybe this time he’s going to do it.// Howard: Hope you’re thirsty, here it comes.// Leonard: Watch me.// Penny: Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?// Leonard: I, uh, ah, um, I…// Penny: A few minutes it is.// Raj: You didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.// Leonard: You guys are making me nervous.// Howard: Fine, then go talk to her on your own.// Leonard: I will. Excuse me.// Penny: Yeah?// Leonard: Hi, uh, um, I’m Leonard?// Penny: Really? You don’t sound so sure.// Leonard: No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something I’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.// Penny: What’s that?// Leonard: Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?// Penny: I think you’re too late.// End fantasy sequence// Leonard: Come on, I would not have peed my pants.// Howard: She nailed it.// Raj: Sounds about right.// Leonard: But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.// Amy: Which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn’t with Penny, she never would have set you up.// Howard: Doesn’t matter. Bernadette still would’ve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. You would’ve been all over me.// Bernadette: Well…// Fantasy sequence in the Cheesecake Factory.// Bernadette: Hey, Penny, can I take that table?// Penny: Sure, why?// Bernadette: The one in the turtleneck is cute.// Raj: Open wide, here comes the happy train.// Howard: Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.// Raj: Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.// Bernadette: Never mind.// End fantasy sequence.// Raj: Oh, man, that is so us.// Leonard: You know, maybe you and I wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself.// Penny: Why?// Leonard: Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.// Fantasy sequence in Penny’s apartment.// Zack: Hey, babe.// Penny: Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?// Zack: Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.// Penny: Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself.// Leonard: Oh, hold on.// Fantasy sequence.// Zack: Aw, babe, I peed myself.// Penny: Me, too.// Leonard: The end.// Amy (Tablet ringing): Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?// (Tablet ringing):// Sheldon: No, it’s not. I’ve seen things. Lady things.// Amy: Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.// Sheldon: Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.// Mrs Cooper (off): Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.// Sheldon: Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.// Leonard: Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there’s pictures. Aah! Don’t open them. Do not open them.// Penny: Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half.// Raj: My father’s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I’m gay.// Bernadette: You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him.// Amy: And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.// Penny: We do?// Fantasy sequence in the Laundry Room.// Penny: Hey, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Hello.// Penny: Doing laundry?// Sheldon: Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.// Penny: Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them.// Penny: Okay, that’s enough.// Leonard: Disagree.// Raj: Keep going.// Howard: More.// Penny: So, what do you think?// Sheldon: A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.// Penny: Please, Sheldon. I need you.// Sheldon: To what?// Penny: To take me.// Sheldon: I’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.// Penny: Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.// Sheldon: Penny, for the thousandth time, I’m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud.// Penny: I think I know how to change your mind.// Leonard: That’s enough.// Raj: Ew.// Stuart: I was okay with it.// Amy (tablet ringing): How’s it going, Sheldon?// (tablet ringing)// Sheldon: Actually, much better.// Leonard: Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?// Sheldon: I don’t know. I just got back.// Amy: Where’d you go?// Sheldon: My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. (Scream from other room) Excuse me, I’m on the phone. So rude.// (Scream from other room)// Amy: Here’s another one. Penny, if it weren’t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.// Penny: Great.// Raj: At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.// Bernadette: Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?// Leonard: We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.// Howard: I lived with her to save money.// Raj: Yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding.// Bernadette: Aw, so I guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?// Howard: Not exactly.// Penny: What do you mean, not exactly?// Howard: Well, things would be a little different.// Fantasy sequence in Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, where’s my lunch? I’m starving.// Howard: I know you’re starving. The neighbours know you’re starving. There’s starving people in Africa who know you’re starving.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): That’s it? There’s not enough food.// Howard:Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don’t know what else to do.// Bernadette: How is this any different?// Howard: You didn’t let me finish. Here you go, Mother.// Dead Mrs Wolowitz: You’re a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.// Amy: Wait, did she die or did you kill her?// Howard: Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she’s dead.// Bernadette: Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?// Leonard: Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man.// Raj: Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.// Fantasy scene in Raj’s apartment.// Raj: Come on, Leonard, dinner.// Fat Leonard: Coming.// Leonard: Hang on. Why would I be fat?// Raj: You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.// Leonard: Why can’t you be fat, too?// Fat Leonard: What do you want to do for dessert?// Fat Raj: I think there’s still half a cake from breakfast.// Fat Leonard: No, there’s not.// Fat Stuart: Hey, guys.// Fat Leonard and Raj: Stuart!// Raj: What are you doing?// Stuart: I just wanted to be in anyone’s story.// Raj: Yeah, but why are you fat?// Stuart: ‘Cause Leonard was fat.// Penny: Amy, what about you? What do you think you’d be doing if you never met Sheldon?// Amy: It’s hard to say, my life would be so different.// Howard: You can say better. Sheldon can’t hear you.// Amy: I don’t know.// Fantasy sequence in Amy’s apartment.// Amy: Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)// (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)// Stuart: I’ll stop now.// Sheldon: That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy.// Penny: Aw.// Amy: Yay.// Raj: Congrats.// Sheldon: Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.// Leonard: Well, good for you, buddy. We’ll let you get back in there.// Sheldon: Oh no, no, I’m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.// Howard: Aw, he’s already taking after Uncle Shelly.// Amy: Come on, Sheldon, you should go.// Sheldon: Why?// Amy: Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.// Sheldon: Ugh, all right, I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.// Bernadette: You actually got him to do it.// Rajj: Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him.// Amy: If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it.// Leonard: I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.// Amy: I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.// Leonard: Hang on, I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. Look.// Amy: I don’t understand.// Leonard: He made you his screensaver.// Amy: Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?// Leonard: Oh, well, it’s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you’re in the mix.// Amy: I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one.// Penny: Who’s that?// Leonard: Oh, Madame Curie.// Amy: That’s fine, she’s dead.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: You okay?// Amy: Just really glad you’re back.// Sheldon: Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.// Amy: I missed you.// Sheldon: To quote Han Solo, I know.// Amy: Did you miss me?// Sheldon: I would’ve preferred to have you there with me.// Amy: Oh.// Sheldon: Or instead of me.// Amy: Did you hold the baby?// Sheldon: I did.// Amy: And? How did it make you feel?// Sheldon: Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.// Fantasy sequence at the Cheesecake Factory.// Fat Leonard: I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.// Howard: And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.// Fat Raj: Put up or shut up. You make it, I’ll drink it.// Penny: You guys need anything else?// Fat Leonard: Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.// Penny: I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?// Stuart: Not until I get my kiss.Series 07 Episode 12 – The Hesitation Ramification// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: This is nice, that we all get to eat together.// Leonard: Absolutely.// Amy: Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?// Sheldon: We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to.// Penny: Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this.// Leonard: What happened?// Penny: I just got a part on a TV show.// Amy: Congratulations.// Leonard: What? That’s great. Guys.// Howard: Oh, yeah// Sheldon: Yay, Penny.// Amy: What’s the show?// Penny: Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!// Leonard: That’s amazing.// Penny: Yeah.// Howard: What’s your part?// Penny: Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.// Raj: Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.// Leonard: So it, it’s just flirting?// Penny: Well, yeah. Why?// Leonard: Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.// Amy: He’s wrong.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.// Raj: So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.// Leonard: Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?// Raj: I don’t see why not.// Howard: If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.// Sheldon: Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.// Leonard: It’s a joke.// Sheldon: I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t.// Penny: Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.// Howard: We’ll be there.// Raj: Can we bring anything?// Penny: Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.// Sheldon: Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: Leonard, do you think I’m funny?// Leonard: No. Do you?// Sheldon: I think I’m hysterical.// Leonard: I take it back. That was funny.// Sheldon: The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object.// Leonard: I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.// Sheldon: Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.// Leonard: You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.// Sheldon: Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd.// Leonard: Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…// Sheldon: I don’t get it.// Scene: Bernadette’s car.// Bernadette: Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart.// Howard: Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.// Raj: I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?// Bernadette: Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.// Stuart: When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.// Raj: Are possums cute?// Stuart: Not at all.// Howard: If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.// Raj: You mean like fatties and uggos?// Bernadette: Or maybe just stop talking.// Howard: I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary.// Bernadette: Or just keep dating the possum.// Voice on television: Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources.// Second voice: No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…// Leonard: I’m so proud of you.// Penny: We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.// Leonard: I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.// Sheldon: I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.// Amy: Why?// Sheldon: I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.// Amy: Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.// Sheldon: All right.// Penny: Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.// Man on TV: I guess it’s you and me, kid.// Mark Harmon on TV: What are you doing?// Woman on TV: I’m trying to make peace.// Mark Harmon on TV: We’re good.// Woman on TV: Good.// Mark Harmon on TV: Really? Because…// Penny: Are you kidding me?// Leonard: What’s wrong?// Penny: Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?// Sheldon: Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost.// Penny: No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.// Bernadette: What happened?// Penny: They must’ve cut it.// Leonard: Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry.// Howard: That stinks.// Raj: I’m sure you were great.// Penny: This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.// Sheldon: I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny (on phone): No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.// (on phone)// Leonard: How you doing?// Penny: Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.// Leonard: You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.// Penny: Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.// Leonard: Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway.// Penny: Unbelievable.// Leonard: Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant.// Penny: Then what did you mean?// Leonard: I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.// Penny: I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.// Leonard: Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.// Penny: I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.// Leonard: Right.// Penny: Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?// Leonard: Yes.// Penny: So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.// Leonard: Honestly?// Penny: Yes, honestly.// Leonard: I don’t.// Penny: How could you say that?// Leonard: I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.// Penny: Oh.// Leonard: Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that.// Penny: No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.// Leonard: That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.// Penny: Wow, thank you.// Leonard: Should’ve let Sheldon come.// Sheldon: This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise.// Amy: Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…// Sheldon: BRAIN LESIONS!// Amy: Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny.// Sheldon: Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.// Amy: Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological… (Sheldon drops his trousers) Okay, that’s pretty good.// (Sheldon drops his trousers)// Sheldon: Excellent.// Scene: The mall.// Stuart: How about her?// Raj: No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.// Stuart: Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?// Raj: That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?// Stuart: We’ll find somebody else.// Sheldon: Kumquat?// Amy: I guess.// Sheldon: Ointment?// Amy: Sure.// Sheldon: Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?// Amy: I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.// Sheldon: Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.// Amy: Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?// Sheldon: All of them.// Penny: You didn’t get your part cut.// Voice on TV: All right, baby, here’s the deal.// Penny: And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!// Leonard: Hey. Can we talk?// Penny: We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.// Leonard: That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.// Penny: Thank you.// Leonard: And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.// Penny: Are you serious? For what?// Leonard: The new Star Wars movie.// Penny: What? How did you manage that?// Leonard: There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.// Penny: Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.// Leonard: So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.// Penny: Really, let it go.// Leonard: Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.// Stuart: How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?// Raj: Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.// Stuart: We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.// Raj: I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.// Amy: Hello.// Bernadette: Hey.// Howard: Where’s Sheldon?// Amy: He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.// Bernadette: That’s interesting.// Amy: It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?// Bernadette: If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.// Howard: Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?// Bernadette: No, of course not.// Howard: Well, I’d be able to tell anyway.// Bernadette: I don’t think you would.// Howard: Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. (Bernadette laughs uncontrollably) Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.// (Bernadette laughs uncontrollably)// Leonard (on phone): Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?// Penny: Hey.// Leonard: Yeah, I’ll call you back.// Penny: Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.// Leonard: Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic.// Penny: Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.// Leonard: Come on. It’s okay.// Penny: No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.// Leonard: No, you’re not.// Penny: Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.// Leonard: Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.// Penny: No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.// Leonard: Well, you have me.// Penny: You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.// Leonard: What?// Penny: Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?// Leonard: Um…// Penny: Did you seriously just say um?// Leonard: Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.// Penny: Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?// Leonard: That is not what I said.// Penny: No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.// Sheldon: Who’s in the mood to laugh?// Leonard: Really not a good time.// Sheldon: But I used science to construct the perfect joke.// Penny: I’m gonna go.// Leonard: Penny, don’t.// Penny: No, no, I just need to be alone.// Sheldon: So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?// Leonard: To my room.// Sheldon: Should I follow you?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Leonard, wait.// Sheldon: I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.// Stuart: How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.// Raj: That’s a mirror.// Stuart: Oh, yeah.// Security Guard: Hey, fellas, mall’s closing.// Raj: Sorry.// Security Guard: Yeah. Good night.// Raj: Uh, excuse me.// Security Guard: Yeah?// Raj: Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?// Security Guard: It’s all right.// Raj: Okay, nice talking to you.// Stuart: Smooth.// Sheldon: Can’t sleep?// Sheldon: Would you like to talk about it?// Leonard: Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes.// Sheldon: Why not?// Leonard: That’s a good question.// Sheldon: Does that mean the relationship is over?// Leonard: I don’t know.// Sheldon: Why don’t you ask her?// Leonard: Because I’m afraid to know the answer.// Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry.// Leonard: That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?// Sheldon: No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry.// Leonard: Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?// Sheldon: No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Howard: Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…// Bernadette: How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?// Howard: I’m in the middle of something.// Bernadette: So am I.Series 07 Episode 13 – The Occupation Recalibration// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: It’s an outrage.// Leonard: I know.// Sheldon: The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.// Leonard: You need to let it go, Sheldon.// Sheldon: You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.// Leonard: Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days.// Sheldon: But I don’t want a vacation.// Leonard: Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now.// Sheldon: Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?// Leonard: It doesn’t.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Leonard: I’m gonna go talk to Penny.// Sheldon: I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. (Leonard knocks three times) Penny. Sorry.// (Leonard knocks three times)// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.// Leonard: Okay.// Penny: Yeah. Come in.// Leonard: Look, if you want to break up, just say it.// Penny: Leonard…// Leonard: No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.// Penny: Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.// Leonard: Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?// Penny: Yeah, I probably wouldn’t.// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny: Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.// Leonard: Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.// Penny: Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: Wow. That, that’s a big step.// Penny: I know.// Leonard: So, well, before making any rash…// Penny: I already quit.// Leonard: And I support you.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Come on, take me to work with you.// Leonard: No. You’re on vacation.// Sheldon: Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?// Leonard: Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?// Sheldon: No. I was just tricking you.// Leonard: Bye.// Sheldon: Leonard, wait. Take me with you.// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Please.// Sheldon: Too bad. I’m coming with you.// Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, stay.// Sheldon: But.// Leonard: I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me.// Scene: The comic book store.// Bernadette: Hey Stuart.// Stuart: Hey.// Bernadette: Sorry. Did I startle you?// Stuart: Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?// Bernadette: Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.// Stuart: Wow. What happened?// Bernadette: Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.// Stuart: Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not.// Bernadette: Do you have this one?// Stuart: Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?// Bernadette: Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.// Stuart: Oh. What’s the hurry?// Bernadette: Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.// Stuart: Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises.// Bernadette: You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.// Stuart: Really? Do you have any of these?// Scene: Amy’s laboratory.// Amy: Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?// Howard: Anybody home?// Amy: Hey, what brings you guys here?// Raj: Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.// Amy: Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse.// Bert: Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company.// Amy: That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.// Howard: Hi.// Raj: Hey. Good to see you.// Bert: Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.// Amy: This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.// Bert: Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?// Howard: You’re both into rock?// Bert: Yeah. Well, see ya.// Amy: Oh, you forgot your quartz.// Bert: Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.// Amy: He’s nice.// Howard: Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you.// Amy: What?! No, he doesn’t.// Raj: He brought you a pretty rock.// Amy: So? He does that every day. Oh.// Howard: You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay.// Amy: He’s not my boyfriend.// Raj: Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.// Amy: Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?// Raj: Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.// Amy: What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.// Howard: Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?// Amy: I guess it hasn’t come up.// Howard: There you go.// Raj: And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?// Amy: I’m sorry. Who are you dating?// Raj: Yeah, knock it off, Howard.// Penny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Hello.// Penny: You okay?// Sheldon: I’m on vacation. What do you think?// Penny: Why are you sitting in the stairwell?// Sheldon: Leonard told me to stay.// Penny: Oh. Well, good boy.// Sheldon: Where are you going?// Penny: Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.// Sheldon: Well, have fun.// Penny: Okay. You want to come with me?// Sheldon: Really?// Penny: Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.// Stuart (on phone): All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.// (on phone)// Bernadette: Oh, that’s great.// Stuart: No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself.// Bernadette: Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?// Stuart: You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off.// Bernadette: Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Amy: Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?// Howard: So, what is she doing today?// Leonard: I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her.// Raj: Well, do you support this?// Leonard: Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.// Amy: That’s nice.// Leonard: You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.// Penny: Hi. What’s up?// Leonard: Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?// Penny: Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.// Penny: Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Voice: Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.// Sheldon: Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.// Voice: Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.// Sheldon: Wow. Didn’t see that coming.// Voice: In.// Sheldon: Let me guess.// Voice: And out.// Sheldon: What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?// Penny: I didn’t get it.// Sheldon: A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.// Penny: Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?// Sheldon: Do you see me drinking lemonade?// Penny: No. I’m serious.// Sheldon: Why do you ask?// Penny: Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?// Sheldon: No, I don’t think you are.// Penny: Really?// Sheldon: The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.// Penny: Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?// Sheldon: Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers.// Penny: Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.// Bert: Hey.// Amy: Hello, Bert.// Bert: So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.// Amy: Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.// Bert: Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.// Amy: Weren’t you?// Bert: Yeah.// Amy: That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.// Bert: That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.// Amy: No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.// Bert: Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.// Amy: Don’t say that.// Bert: It’s okay. I know I’m a monster.// Amy: No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you.// Bert: Sweet. It’s a date.// Amy: No, it’s not.// Bert: Too late.// Scene: Capital Comics.// Bernadette: Wow.// Stuart: Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.// Jesse: Hey, Stuart.// Stuart: Jesse.// Jesse: Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten.// Stuart: My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.// Jesse: No, I was talking about your skin.// Stuart: Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.// Jesse: Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.// Stuart: Even you, Sweatpants?// Sweatpants: Free popcorn.// Jesse: Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?// Bernadette: No, thanks.// Jesse: How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?// Bernadette: Hey.// Jesse: I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.// Stuart: It’s on Merton Avenue.// Bernadette: I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.// Jesse: Sorry. You want the book or not?// Bernadette: Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.// Stuart: You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.// Jesse: What’s that?// Stuart: Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.// Howard: The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.// Amy: So what am I supposed to do now?// Raj: Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?// Amy: This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him.// Howard: Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.// Raj: Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.// Howard: Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.// Raj: Megan Pincus.// Howard: Tammy Cho.// Raj: Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?// Howard: Arlene Russel.// Raj: Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.// Howard: Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.// Amy: Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?// Raj: I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.// Howard: That’s how you reject a guy.// Amy: Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.// Howard: No, don’t.// Raj: He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.// Howard: You want us to talk to him?// Amy: Really? You would do that?// Raj: Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.// Amy: Thank you.// Howard: Let’s go.// Raj: So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?// Howard: Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.// Scene: The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.// Penny: And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold.// Sheldon: I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.// Penny: Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.// Sheldon: Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.// Leonard: Oh, hey.// Penny: And now we go to Reverse Warrior.// Leonard: How did she get you to do yoga?// Sheldon: Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.// Penny: I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.// Leonard: Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.// Penny: Sheldon, take a break.// Sheldon: Namaste.// Penny: Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?// Leonard: Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?// Penny: Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?// Leonard: Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in.// Penny: Yeah, well, maybe we do.// Sheldon: I’m willing to if you guys are.// Leonard: Can we please have some privacy?// Sheldon: Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?// Sheldon: Penny?// Penny: Okay, wait. What are we doing?// Leonard: For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.// Sheldon: Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.// Penny: Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.// Sheldon: Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22.// Leonard: I swear, I am on your side.// Penny: You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it.// Sheldon: He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?// Leonard: Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified.// Penny: Well, it’s scary for me, too.// Sheldon: I’m fine with it.// Leonard: My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you.// Penny: Okay. Thank you.// Sheldon: Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw.// Jesse: You’re back.// Bernadette: Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now.// Jesse: No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?// Bernadette: No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.// Jesse: I only have chocolate chip.// Bernadette: Well, that sounds even better.// Scene: Bert’s car.// Bert: Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.// Raj: We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.// Howard: Really, really sorry.// Bert: Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!Series 07 Episode 14 – The Convention Conundrum// Scene: The apartment.// Howard: T-minus 60 seconds.// Raj: Oh, it all comes down to this.// Leonard: Oh, I’ve got butterflies.// Sheldon: Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.// Penny: What’s going on?// Leonard: Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.// Penny: Oh.// Howard: T Minus 45 seconds.// Leonard: They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…// Sheldon: Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.// Penny: This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.// Howard: T-minus 30 seconds.// Raj: Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.// Sheldon: Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.// Raj: And I told you I get diaper rash.// Howard: 15 seconds.// Leonard: Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.// Howard: Five, four, three, two, one.// Sheldon: It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go.// Raj: Anyone in?// Sheldon: No.// Leonard: Not yet.// Howard: Nope.// Sheldon: Do not stop refreshing your screens.// All (repeatedly): Refresh. Refresh. Refresh….// (repeatedly)// Penny: Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The same, shortly after.// All (repeatedly): Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…// Howard: It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.// Penny: To be cool? Yeah.// Leonard: I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue.// Sheldon: Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.// Raj: Uh, what number in line are you?// Leonard: Uh, fifteen…// Howard: Great.// Leonard: …thousand two hundred and eleven.// Howard: Damn.// Raj: Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.// Howard: Really?// Leonard: Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left.// Sheldon: Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.// Leonard: Sunday’s gone.// Sheldon: Not Sunday, I love Sunday.// Raj: So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?// Leonard: Yeah.// Howard: I can’t believe we’re not going.// Sheldon: It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me.// Penny: Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.// Sheldon: I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.// Penny: What? You were all going as the Hulk?// Howard: Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.// Raj: We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.// All: Yeah.// Penny: And we’re back to the first kind of sad.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.// Leonard: Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.// Sheldon: I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.// Leonard: Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.// Howard: I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.// Sheldon: How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?// Leonard: The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.// Howard: Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention.// Sheldon: You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off.// Sheldon (on phone): Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.// (on phone)// Leonard: Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?// Sheldon: I didn’t even get to that part.// Leonard: Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.// Sheldon: Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard.// Leonard: Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you.// Sheldon: You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.// Leonard: Good luck.// Sheldon: No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets.// Amy: Last week, you spent that on a little dress.// Penny: Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.// Bernadette: Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.// Amy: Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?// Bernadette: Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.// Amy: Oh. You mean like a museum?// Penny: Yes, like a museum, but anything else.// Bernadette: Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.// Amy: Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.// Penny: Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.// Bernadette: La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.// Penny: No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.// Raj: Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.// Leonard: Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.// Howard: Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.// Leonard: Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?// Sheldon: I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.// Raj: How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?// Sheldon: Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…// Howard: And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.// Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble.// Sheldon: You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there. (To the Imperial March theme) Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…// (To the Imperial March theme)// Scene: The same, later.// Howard (on phone): Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late.// Raj: Does he sound like a criminal?// Howard: What do you mean?// Raj: You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?// Leonard: Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940.// Raj: I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?// Howard: Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?// Raj: I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?// Leonard: Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.// Howard: Why do you think I told him to come to your place?// Scene: Hotel tea room.// Amy: There sure are a lot of little kids here.// Penny: I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.// Bernadette: I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.// Amy: Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.// Bernadette: That’s cute.// Amy: It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.// Bernadette: Should we leave?// Penny: Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.// Bernadette: I could go for a drink.// Amy: Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.// Scene: A sushi restaurant.// James Earl Jones: Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?// Sheldon: Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker.// James Earl Jones: Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.// Sheldon: He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.// Raj: Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.// Leonard: Maybe this isn’t a good idea.// Howard: I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.// Raj: Do it.// Howard: Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.// Leonard: Hold on. We always do this.// Howard: Do what?// Leonard: Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.// Raj: That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.// Leonard: Even Batman breaks the rules.// Raj: You know I struggle with Batman.// Leonard: I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses.// Raj: Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.// Leonard: Howard, you in on this?// Howard: No need. I’m breaking rules all the time.// Leonard: Name one.// Howard: Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.// Raj: What about that little cup they give you?// Howard: Yeah. What about it?// Raj: Are you impressed by that?// Leonard: A little.// Raj: Yeah, me, too.// Scene: The sushi restaurant.// James: You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.// Sheldon: Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?// James: He was not. How messed up was that?// Sheldon: So messed up.// James: What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.// Scene: The hotel bar.// Penny: So, afternoon tea was a bust.// Amy: On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.// Penny: Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.// Bernadette: Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.// Penny: Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me.// Amy: Gosh.// Penny: I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.// Amy: I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.// Penny: Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.// Bernadette: Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.// Penny: Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?// Howard: He just parked. He’s on his way up.// Leonard: Good. This is exciting.// Raj: It is. I feel alive.// Leonard: Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.// Raj: Maybe slapped with a fine.// Howard: Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?// Raj: Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?// Leonard: I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.// Raj: He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?// Howard: Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away.// Raj: I thought you were a badass.// Howard: I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.// Scene: An ice cream parlour.// Sheldon: Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?// James: It is true.// Sheldon: Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?// James: They sure did.// Sheldon: Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?// James: That’s right.// Sheldon: Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.// Penny: I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?// Bernadette: Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways.// Penny: I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.// Amy: I told you it was Penny.// Penny: Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.// Amy: Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are.// Scene: The apartment. Banging on door.// Howard: Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.// Scene: A big wheel.// Sheldon: Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think.// James: I am.// Scene: A karaoke bar.// Sheldon: In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…// James: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…// Sheldon: Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.// Sceme: Outside a house.// Sheldon: I don’t understand what we’re doing.// James: Shh.// Sheldon: Whose house is this?// James: Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to run. (Rings doorbell)// (Rings doorbell)// Carrie Fisher: It’s not funny anymore, James.// James: Then why am I laughing?// Scene: A sauna.// James: Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.// Sheldon: Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.// James: What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?// Sheldon: Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?// James: No. Something about a convention.// Sheldon: Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.// James: Why don’t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?// Sheldon: Really?// James: Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every night.// Sheldon: Ay-yi-yi.// James: Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.// James: So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.// Sheldon: I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?Series 07 Episode 15 – The Locomotive Manipulation// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision.// Sheldon: I submitted you a notarised list.// Amy: I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.// Sheldon: Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please.// Amy: We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day.// Sheldon: Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.// Amy: Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.// Sheldon: People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.// Amy: I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.// Sheldon: I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.// Amy: Come on, Sheldon. Why not?// Sheldon: For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.// Amy: One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.// Sheldon: Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.// Amy: I got you your own room.// Sheldon: What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?// Amy: It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.// Sheldon: Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.// Amy: We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.// Sheldon: Vintage? Be specific.// Amy: An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.// Sheldon: Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good.// Credits sequence.// Bernadette: Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.// Penny: No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.// Leonard: Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs.// Penny: That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.// Sheldon: Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?// Howard: I’m sorry, what?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.// Howard: I don’t own a pocket watch.// Sheldon: Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.// Raj: Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?// Penny: You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.// Raj: I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.// Amy: Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic.// Raj: Except I’ll be alone.// Amy: I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.// Leonard: We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.// Penny: Yeah.// Raj: Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room.// Penny: Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.// Scene: The Pullman dining car.// Amy: What do you think, Sheldon?// Sheldon: It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.// Amy: I’m so glad you like it.// Sheldon: I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.// Leonard (on phone): Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. (To Cinnamon) That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?// (on phone)// (To Cinnamon)// Penny: Happy Valentine’s Day.// Leonard: Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties.// Penny: Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.// Leonard: Got you a little something, too.// Penny: Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?// Leonard: It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.// Penny: Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.// Leonard: Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go.// Penny: Should we take this little party to the bedroom?// Leonard: Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.// Penny: Oh, that’s true.// Leonard: In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.// Penny: That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.// Leonard: To the bedroom.// Scene: The dining car.// Waiter: And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?// Sheldon: Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?// Waiter: I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food.// Sheldon: Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?// Amy: Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute.// Man in seat behind: Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.// Sheldon: Get out of town.// Howard: Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train.// Leonard: Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.// Penny: Oh, my God.// Leonard: It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.// Penny: No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.// Leonard: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?// Penny: We gotta get her to a vet right now.// Leonard: I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.// Penny: Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.// Leonard: Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.// Sheldon: Do another one, do another one.// Man: Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.// Sheldon: It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I’ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.// Man: I’ve been on that train. And I just was again.// Amy: See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.// Sheldon: How many trains have you been on?// Man: Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.// Sheldon: Wow. Your life’s amazing.// Man: Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.// Amy: Why do I even try?// Bernadette: I’m gonna fix this right now.// Howard: Okay. Just make it look like an accident.// Bernadette: Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.// Sheldon: You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.// Man: All right.// Bernadette: Great. Now there’s two of ’em.// Scene: A vet’s surgery.// Lady Vet: How much chocolate did she eat?// Penny: A whole box.// Leonard: Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.// Penny: So the point is I may have saved her life.// Vet: I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?// Leonard: No. Maybe to her.// Vet: How big a box of chocolate was it?// Penny: Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.// Leonard: Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?// Penny: Do you know how much gas is?// Vet: Hey.// Penny: Sorry.// Leonard: Sorry.// Raj: Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.// Vet: You’re the owner?// Raj: Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.// Vet: Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.// Raj: Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.// Vet: Got it. Should have been a dentist.// Man: Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?// Sheldon: Trick question. There never was one.// Man: Or was there?// Sheldon: What?// Man: In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.// Sheldon: In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?// Howard: A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.// Man: Hold on to your conductor’s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.// Sheldon: I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?// Waiter: Better than you think.// Man: You know, if you ask nicely, they’ll let you visit the engine room.// Sheldon: I never want this day to end.// Amy: It’s feeling like it never will.// Sheldon: Come on.// Man: Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?// Scene: The vets surgery.// Raj: As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?// Penny: It wasn’t cheap. It was free.// Leonard: We’re really sorry. It was an accident.// Penny: Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.// Leonard: Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.// Raj: Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?// Vet: She’s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.// Raj: All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.// Vet: It’s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We’re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.// Raj: Thank you.// Vet: Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.// Raj: Oh, yeah?// Vet: And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.// Penny: I think there’s something going on between the two of them.// Leonard: Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?// Howard: You okay?// Amy: Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?// Howard: Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos.// Amy: I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.// Bernadette: Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200// bucks it wasn’t gonna happen.// Howard: I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.// Bernadette: See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.// Howard: She’s right.// Bernadette: So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.// Howard: I had a little to do with it.// Bernadette: Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?// Howard: I am.// Leonard: They’ve been in there, like, half an hour.// Penny: Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.// Leonard: How long should we stay?// Penny: I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.// Leonard: I saw a Thai place next door.// Penny: Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.// Leonard: How’s she doing?// Penny: How is everything?// Leonard: Yeah.// Raj: She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.// Penny: Oh, good.// Vet: So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don’t hesitate to call.// Raj: Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.// Vet: My pleasure. Have a nice night.// Leonard: Yes, thank you for all your help.// Penny: Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.// Vet: Oh, do you guys own any pets?// Penny: No.// Vet: Good.// Howard: I love you so much.// Bernadette: I love you, too.// Howard: Sorry.// Bernadette: Sorry.// Man: You guys missed a pretty great time.// Sheldon: The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.// Man: It was crazy.// Sheldon: Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.// Amy: Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.// Howard: There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?// Bernadette: Oh, that sounds so romantic.// Amy: Oh, give it a rest.// Bernadette: Let’s go.// Amy: Why are you still here?// Sheldon: Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.// Amy: I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.// Sheldon: How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.// Man: I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?// Sheldon: I get it.// Amy: Leave.// Sheldon: What is your problem?// Amy: It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.// Sheldon: Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?// Amy: Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen.// Sheldon: Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic.// Amy: That was nice.// Sheldon: Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.// Amy: Okay, have fun.// Sheldon: Do you want to come with me?// Amy: Really? I do.// Man: Hey, guys, wait up.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj: There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?// Sheldon: It was wonderful.// Leonard: Great. What did you do?// Sheldon: I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.// Leonard: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details.// Sheldon: Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.// Leonard: No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?// Sheldon: Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.// Leonard: Well, give it a go.// Sheldon: I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.// Leonard: Additional data. You dog.// Sheldon: I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.Series 07 Episode 16 – The Table Polarisation// Scene: The apartment// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Scene: A furniture store.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Scene: A doctor’s surgery.Series 07 Episode 17 – The Friendship Turbulence// Sceme: The apartment// Bernadette: Raj, your tag’s sticking out.// Raj: Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in, like, two years.// Bernadette: Now I feel a little gross.// Raj: You’re only making it seem more real for me.// Howard: Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me.// Raj: Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?// Sheldon: How about Penny’s depressing acting career?// Leonard: Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.// Penny: Aw, thank you.// Howard: Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?// Raj: Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.// Amy: Can I borrow it when you’re done?// Penny: Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.// Leonard: Why would you do that?// Penny: Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.// Bernadette: Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.// Sheldon: She does. 42 minutes in.// Raj: While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.// Sheldon: I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is.// Penny: Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.// Sheldon: Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: So are you really not gonna do this movie?// Penny: Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career.// Leonard: Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?// Penny: Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”// Raj: If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.// Leonard: I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing.// Amy: I think we’re gonna go.// Sheldon: Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.// Howard: Hey, I work at the same university you do.// Sheldon: Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.// Bernadette: Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?// Penny: Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.// Leonard: No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.// Sheldon: Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.// Howard: I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.// Sheldon: I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.// Raj: Ha-a-a. Still funny.// Bernadette: That was ten years ago.// Sheldon: Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.// Amy: Really?// Howard: The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.// Raj: I was there. It was funny.// Sheldon: In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.// Scene: The street// Amy: Thanks for walking me to my car.// Raj: Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.// Amy: Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.// Raj: I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.// Amy: Whatever happened with your online dating?// Raj: No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.// Amy: Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.// Raj: It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.// Amy: Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.// Raj: What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years.// Amy: That’s true. Do whatever you want.// Scene: Sheldon’s office.// Howard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Howard: Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.// Sheldon: Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.// Howard: Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off.// Sheldon: Very well. How do you propose we move forward?// Howard: Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.// Sheldon: That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.// Howard: Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre.// Sheldon: I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?// Howard: No.// Sheldon: I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.// Scene: Amy’s lab.// Raj: Amy, I could use some help.// Amy: Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.// Raj: I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.// Amy: Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.// Raj: And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.// Amy: Great, so what do you need me for?// Raj: Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.// Amy: All right.// Raj: Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.// Amy: Wow.// Raj: I know. Powerful stuff, huh?// Amy: No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.// Raj: Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.// Amy: Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”// Raj: Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.// Amy: I’m not gonna pretend to be you.// Raj: I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.// Amy: Well, what would I say to her?// Raj: Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Sheldon: Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.// Penny: Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.// Penny: Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.// Sheldon: Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?// Penny: Yes.// Sheldon: Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…// Penny: Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.// Sheldon: Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.// Leonard: Are we playing individual or teams?// Raj: Teams are fun.// Sheldon: Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.// Raj: But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…// Howard: I really don’t think we do tha…// Raj: Do that. See?// Penny: Oh, hi.// Leonard: Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?// Penny: Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?// Leonard: Yeah, sure.// Raj: Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?// Howard: Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…// Raj: Plane tickets? Yeah.// Howard: Will you please sto…// Raj: Stop that? Okay.// Scene: The stairwell.// Penny: I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can’t drive to auditions.// Leonard: I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?// Penny: I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.// Leonard: At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.// Penny: How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.// Sheldon: Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.// Penny: I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?// Sheldon: It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.// Raj: Hey, you busy?// Amy: No. What’s up?// Raj: Have you heard back from Emily?// Amy: I have.// Raj: Great. And?// Amy: And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.// Raj: I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.// Amy: I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.// Raj: I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.// Amy: Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.// Raj: What’s happening tomorrow night?// Amy: I’m meeting her for coffee.// Raj: What?// Amy: Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.// Raj: I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?// Amy: No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting.// Raj: Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.// Scene: Bernadette’s car.// Howard: That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.// Bernadette: What are you doing?// Howard: Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car.// Bernadette: This is gonna be a long weekend for you.// Howard: You’re the reason I’m doing it.// Bernadette: I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.// Howard: How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.// Bernadette: Hi.// Howard: Hey, buddy.// Bernadette: You excited for Texas?// Sheldon: Oh, very much so.// Howard: It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.// Sheldon: Oh, who’s the real astronaut?// Howard: Buzz Aldrin.// Sheldon: Oh. Yay.// Scene: An airplane.// Sheldon: (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard?// (Tap, tap, tap)// Howard: What now?// Sheldon: I have to go to the bathroom.// Howard: You just went to the bathroom.// Sheldon: But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt.// Howard: Well, it still doesn’t.// Sheldon: I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.// Howard: Fine.// Sheldon: Why are you getting annoyed?// Howard: I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.// Sheldon: Like when?// Howard: When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous.// Sheldon: Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.// Howard: Thank you.// Sheldon: Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?// Sheldon: But I still need to use the bathroom.// Howard: Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?// Sheldon: No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.// Howard: Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.// Sheldon: I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!// Howard: I’m gonna need that bag back.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Leonard: You sure you want to do this?// Penny: Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with.// Leonard: Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood.// Penny: I know. Thank you.// Leonard: Sorry.// Penny: It’s just so humiliating.// Leonard: So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.// Scene: Outside the building.// Leonard: Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.// Penny: Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.// Leonard: I know. I thought we’d take yours.// Penny: I don’t understand.// Leonard: It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.// Penny: I don’t know what to say.// Leonard: Don’t say anything.// Penny: Oh, my God.// Leonard: I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.// Scene: A coffee shop.// Amy: Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.// Raj: Hello, Emily.// Emily: Hello.// Raj: Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?// Emily: No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.// Raj: Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.// Emily: I’m leaving.// Amy: Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?// Emily: You know, I think I’m just gonna go by myself.// Raj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.// Scene: The airplane.// Sheldon: I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.// Howard: I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault.// Sheldon: If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life.// Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.// Announcement: The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You’re now free to move about the cabin.// Howard: It’s over.// Sheldon: Yeah.// Howard: Should we stop holding hands now?// Sheldon: In a minute.// Howard: Okay, good.Series 07 Episode 18 – The Mommy Observation// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?// Raj: He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.// Penny: I wouldn’t be so sure about that.// Leonard: Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.// Raj: Have you heard from Howard?// Bernadette: I did. His talk at NASA went great.// Penny: Sheldon didn’t heckle him?// Bernadette: No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.// Stuart: Hey, guys.// Amy: Oh, hi.// Bernadette: Hi, Stuart.// Raj: Hey, Stuart!// Stuart: How’s it going?// Raj: Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.// Stuart: Oh, how is it?// Penny: Disgusting. Do not tell him.// Leonard: What do you guys want to do tonight?// Amy: I don’t know.// Bernadette: Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.// Raj: Stuart? Are you okay?// Stuart: No, I don’t feel so…// Leonard: Oh, my God, Stuart?// Penny: Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!// Raj: Stuart?// Leonard: Calling 911.// Raj: Well, it’s too late.// Leonard: What do you mean it’s too late?// Raj: He’s been murdered by someone in this room.// Penny: Oh, my God.// Leonard: Oh, come on.// Raj: Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.// Amy: I’m leaving.// Raj: You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.// Bernadette: I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.// Amy: Yeah, it’s Bloom.// Penny: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?// Stuart: What do you think I was gonna do at home?// Credits sequence.// Penny: Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?// Raj: Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?// Penny: You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.// Raj: Thank you.// Penny: That kind of actress. This sucks.// Leonard: Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.// Amy: I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.// Raj: Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.// Amy: Oh, ugh.// Bernadette: All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?// Raj: Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.// Bernadette: What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?// Raj: Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?// Amy: According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.// Raj: Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.// Penny: Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?// Raj: Any question but that.// Penny: Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?// Stuart: Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?// Bernadette: What do you care? You’re dead.// Stuart: Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.// Scene: A hire car.// Sheldon: Thank you for my bobble head.// Howard: Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.// Sheldon: It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?// Howard: We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.// Sheldon: I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.// Howard: Oh, boy.// Sheldon: Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.// Howard: I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.// Bernadette: So, what happens next?// Raj: I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.// Penny: Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.// Amy: Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.// Leonard: Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.// Raj: Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.// Penny: Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?// Raj: Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.// Bernadette: I didn’t know you were fat.// Raj: Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.// Amy: That is so sweet.// Leonard: I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.// Raj: No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.// Bernadette: Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.// Amy: What’s it for?// Bernadette: For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.// Raj: From the future? How fun and imaginative.// Leonard: So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?// Raj: Correct.// Leonard: Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?// Raj: Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?// Leonard: Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?// Penny: I’m gonna need another clue.// Scene: Sheldon’s childhood home.// Howard: Okay, give me the flowers and pie.// Sheldon: But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.// Howard: They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.// Sheldon: Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.// Howard: What’s wrong?// Sheldon: Nothing.// Howard: What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.// Sheldon: I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.// Scene: A bar in Texas.// Howard: You ready to talk about it?// Sheldon: I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?// Howard: Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?// Sheldon: No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?// Howard: Well, did she see you in the window?// Sheldon: No.// Howard: Then don’t say anything.// Sheldon: I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?// Howard: Well, don’t do it on the phone.// Sheldon: No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.// Howard: That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.// Sheldon: Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.// Howard: Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.// Sheldon: I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.// Raj: Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.// Penny: Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.// Stuart: Hey, can I go to the bathroom?// Raj: Fine, just try not to look too alive.// Stuart: That’s my jam.// Bernadette: So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?// Amy: But why?// Raj: Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.// Amy: Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.// Penny: Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.// Leonard: Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.// Penny: Hmm.// Bernadette: So I guess you two are making it work long distance.// Raj: Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.// Amy: What does your card say, Bernadette?// Leonard: Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?// Penny: Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.// Leonard: But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.// Penny: Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.// Leonard: Well, you don’t go into science for the money.// Bernadette: Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.// Penny: So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?// Amy: Dun, dun, dun. He started it.// Raj: Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.// Leonard: Great.// Penny: Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?// Sheldon: Okay, let’s do this.// Howard: Good luck.// Sheldon: You, aren’t you gonna come with me?// Howard: While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.// Sheldon: I saw you having naked sex.// Mrs Cooper: What are you talking about?// Sheldon: Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.// Sheldon: Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?// Mrs Cooper: That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.// Sheldon: Who was he?// Mrs Cooper: His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.// Sheldon: How long have you been involved with him?// Mrs Cooper: A few months.// Sheldon: And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?// Mrs Cooper: That is no way to speak to your mother.// Sheldon: Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.// Mrs Cooper: I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.// Sheldon: Or what?// Mrs Cooper: Or I will send you to your room.// Sheldon: That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.// Mrs Cooper: Go to your room.// Sheldon: But I occupy the moral high ground.// Sheldon: But I’m a professional scientist.// Mrs: Go to your room!// Sheldon: I’m a grown man.// Raj: Can we please get back to the game?// Leonard: In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.// Penny: Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.// Amy: I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.// Leonard: Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?// Amy: Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.// Penny: In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?// Stuart: I think you and Leonard will be together.// Penny: You do?// Stuart: Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.// Leonard: Aw.// Penny: That’s so sweet.// Bernadette: What the hell?// Amy: Excuse me?// Penny: Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?// Stuart: Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.// Penny: Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.// Raj: Oh, come on.// Bernadette: Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.// Scene: Sheldon’s old bedroom.// Howard: Hey, can I come in?// Sheldon: Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.// Howard: That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.// Sheldon: No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.// Howard: You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.// Sheldon: Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.// Howard: I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.// Sheldon: I didn’t know she did.// Howard: Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.// Sheldon: What did you do?// Howard: Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.// Sheldon: I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.// Howard: All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.// Sheldon: You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.// Howard: And the healing begins.// Scene: Mrs Cooper’s living room.// Sheldon: Hello.// Mrs Cooper: Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?// Sheldon: I am.// Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.// Sheldon: I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?// Mrs Cooper: You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.// Sheldon: Then why are you doing it?// Mrs Cooper: Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is.// Sheldon: Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.// Mrs Cooper: That is very Christian of you.// Sheldon: Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.// Mrs Cooper: How old do you think I am?// Sheldon: My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.// Mrs Cooper: Are you having the sex talk with me?// Sheldon: Well, someone has to.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, dear Lord.// Sheldon: No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.// Penny: Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.// Raj: I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.// Amy: It actually was kind of fun.// Raj: You’re just saying that.// Amy: Yeah.// Bernadette: I liked the time travel element.// Raj: Thank you. I thought it was inspired.// Leonard: It was. By Terminator.// Bernadette: Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.// Penny: Definitely.// Leonard: Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.// Bernadette: Aw.// Penny: I love it.// Leonard: Putting it in my phone right now.// Penny: Yeah, me, too.// Stuart: My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.// Raj: And it’s done.// Penny: Yup, we’re all in.// Leonard: All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.// Scene: In front of the building, 20 years later.// Stuart: I knew it.Series 07 Episode 19 – The Indecision Amalgamation// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Boy, do I have to urinate.// Leonard: If only there were a solution to that.// Sheldon: Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.// Leonard: So go to the bathroom.// Sheldon: I can’t.// Leonard: Why not?// Sheldon: Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?// Leonard: Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?// Sheldon: I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.// Leonard: Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?// Penny: I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.// Leonard: Oh, that’s great.// Penny: I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.// Sheldon: Here come the waterworks.// Leonard: Aren’t you gonna ask?// Penny: What is this, my first day?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?// Penny: Yeah, sure.// Amy: Of course.// Bernadette: Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.// Amy: I’m sure it’s lovable.// Penny: I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?// Bernadette: Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.// Amy: Okay.// Bernadette: But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.// Penny: I’m liking my odds here.// Bernadette: So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”// Penny: No.// Bernadette: “LOL.” Smiley face.// Amy: Oh, my gosh.// Bernadette: “P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”// Penny: Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this? (Phone rings) Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?// (Phone rings)// Bernadette: Am I a terrible person?// Amy: No. No, it was a mistake.// Bernadette: Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?// Amy: Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?// Penny: No, I didn’t get it.// Bernadette: I’m so sorry.// Amy: You’ll get offered something soon.// Penny: I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine if I want it.// Bernadette: Are you gonna take it?// Penny: I don’t know what to do.// Amy: Maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?// Scene: A coffee shop.// Raj: Hey. Emily, right?// Emily: Yeah.// Raj: I, I don’t know if you remember me.// Emily: From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?// Raj: Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.// Emily: Uh, don’t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you’re not the weirdest guy I’ve met off the Internet.// Raj: Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me.// Emily: All right, here’s your chance.// Raj: Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.// Amy: Can you get the butter, please?// Sheldon: You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard.// Amy: Then get the other one. Pass the butter.// Sheldon: Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.// Amy: Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.// Sheldon: Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.// Amy: No way.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.// Amy: Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat.// Sheldon: No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.// Amy: Included?// Sheldon: Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.// Amy: Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?// Sheldon: See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.// Amy: Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who’s they?// Sheldon: Xbox.// Amy: You’re kidding.// Sheldon: No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.// Amy: This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?// Sheldon You see? I don’t know. What should I do?// Amy: Please pass the butter!// Penny: Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible.// Leonard: Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.// Penny: Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?// (Reading)// Leonard: Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas.// Penny: No, come on. This is serious.// Leonard: Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?// Penny: Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: What does your agent think?// Penny: She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.// Leonard: You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?// Penny: Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.// Leonard: Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?// Penny: Both of us.// Leonard: So it’s a family film.// Sheldon: Thank you again for dinner.// Amy: You’re welcome.// Sheldon: Good night.// Amy: Uh, it’s date night. Aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?// Sheldon: Oh, of course. (They kiss) Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?// (They kiss)// Amy: No.// Sheldon: Well, they do.// Raj: And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.// Leonard: So, are you gonna see her again?// Raj: Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.// Penny: Okay, like what? Show me.// Raj: I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.// Leonard: You have my blessing. Go for it.// Raj: Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.// Penny: Oh, that’s sad.// Raj: It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.// Penny: Wow.// Leonard: Okay, that’s enough.// Sheldon: Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?// Raj: Uh, Xbox One.// Sheldon: Penny?// Penny: Huh?// Sheldon: Leonard?// Leonard: PS4.// Sheldon: Wolowitz?// Howard: Both great.// Sheldon: Bernadette?// Bernadette: I like the Wii.// Sheldon: Thanks, Grandma.// Raj: Oh, my goodness.// Leonard: What’s up?// Raj: I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.// Leonard: Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.// Penny: Really?// Leonard: Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.// Scene: The same, later.// Raj: What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?// Howard: Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.// Raj: I can’t date two women at once. Zero women, that’s my sweet spot.// Penny: Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal.// Raj: But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?// Howard and Bernadette (together): Yes.// (together)// Bernadette: What do you mean, yes?// Howard: What do you mean, yes?// Bernadette: Were you seeing other women when we started dating?// Howard: No. Were you seeing other men?// Bernadette: No.// Leonard: Were you seeing other men?// Leonard: Aren’t you gonna ask me?// Penny: Come on, really?// Leonard: Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.// Wil Wheaton: Yeah, happy to help. So, what’s going on?// Penny: Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I should take it.// Wil: Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I’ve been embarrassed by.// Penny: I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.// Wil: I wasn’t.// Penny: Me, either.// Leonard: So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?// Wil: Well, it’s tricky. You want to take projects that you’re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you’re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.// Penny: Yeah, beam me up. I love it.// Wil: Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.// Penny: That’s what I’m afraid of.// Wil: So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.// Leonard: Sounds rough.// Wil: I’m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don’t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can’t even get out of bed.// Leonard: Okay, this was helpful.// Scene: The stairwell.// Raj: Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?// Bernadette: Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition.// Raj: Oh, no.// Bernadette: The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.// Howard: Were you like this when I married you?// Leonard (on phone): Don’t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he’s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he’s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.// (on phone)// Raj: Did he help you make a decision about the movie?// Penny: No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?// Raj: As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes.// Howard: He’s gonna die alone, right?// Leonard: Yes.// Penny: Yes.// Bernadette: Yes.// Scene: An electrical store.// Amy: I’m proud of you, Sheldon.// Sheldon: You know, I’m proud of me, too. I’ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice.// Amy: Well, that’s got to be a good feeling.// Sheldon: Oh, it is. Although.// Amy: Oh, crap.// Sheldon: I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.// Amy: You were just a little kid.// Sheldon: Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.// Amy: How old were you then?// Sheldon: Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.// Amy: What’s a Zune?// Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.// Amy: No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it’s good. You did the research.// Sheldon: But what if I’m wrong?// Amy: You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?// Sheldon: You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.// Amy: Then I’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.// Sheldon: Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?// Amy: How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.// Sheldon: Interesting.// Amy: So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One.// Sheldon: All right, I’ll try.// Amy: What is it?// Sheldon: A quarter.// Amy: Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.// Scene: A restaurant.// Raj: You look, you look really pretty tonight.// Emily: Thanks. I love that jacket.// Raj: Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I’m seeing her Saturday, And I’m glad you like it, it’s from J. Crew.// Emily: I don’t understand.// Raj: My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I’m being deceitful.// Emily: Are you getting back together with her?// Raj: No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?// Emily: Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let’s do this. How serious were you two?// Raj: Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.// Emily: Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?// Raj: Yeah.// Emily: That’s kind of adorable.// Raj: Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.// Emily: I’m still here.// Raj: Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.// Emily: We just met. You don’t need to tell me about other people you’re seeing.// Raj: Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.// Scene: The electrical store.// Sheldon: On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?// Amy: I can’t feel my legs.// Store assistant: Oh, I’m sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.// Sheldon: But I haven’t decided yet.// Store assistant: You’ll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.// Amy: Let’s get you some food. You, You’ll feel better after you eat.// Sheldon: Okay.// Amy: What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?// Sheldon: I don’t know. Hey, look, a quarter.// Scene: A film set. Penny is being fitted with gorilla hands.// Costume guy: How’s that feel?// Penny: Great. Not like regret at all.// Wil: Penny? We’re working together. Awesome.Series 07 Episode 20 – The Relationship Diremption// Scene: The cafeteria.// Leonard: I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.// Raj: I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.// Howard: Only without the sex.// Raj: Yeah, literally, none of it.// Leonard: What do you think about it, Sheldon?// Sheldon: Meh.// Raj: Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?// Sheldon: Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?// Leonard: Oh, my God, you’re jealous.// Sheldon: Why would I be jealous?// Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.// Barry: Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.// Sheldon: Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?// Barry: No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.// Sheldon: Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.// Barry: Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.// Sheldon: Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?// Howard: Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Hey, you’re up early.// Sheldon: I couldn’t sleep.// Penny: I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.// Sheldon: No, that’s not it.// Penny: Is something bothering you?// Sheldon: Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.// Penny: Oh, come on, try me.// Sheldon: All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.// Penny: Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.// Sheldon: You mean your acting career?// Penny: No.// Sheldon: Your relationship with Leonard?// Sheldon: Your failed attempt to go back to college?// Penny: No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.// Sheldon: I said Leonard, you said no.// Penny: I’m talking about other guys.// Sheldon: Okay. Well, what do you do?// Penny: You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.// Sheldon: I don’t know if I can do that.// Penny: I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.// Leonard: Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?// Sheldon: Break it off, shake hands, walk away.// Leonard: Hey, how’s dating two women going?// Raj: Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.// Howard: And?// Raj: She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you// be more like Emily? Those feelings became less mixed.// Leonard: Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?// Raj: At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.// Howard: I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.// Raj: Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.// Howard: She is. But I like that attitude.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?// Raj: You’re really going to do this?// Sheldon: I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.// Howard: You’re reading Cosmo?// Sheldon: Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.// Howard: What’s this?// Sheldon: Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.// Leonard: Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?// Sheldon: It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.// Raj: It’s going to be okay.// Sheldon: I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.// Howard: So, you and Emily still together?// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Howard: I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.// Raj: Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.// Howard: Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?// Raj: She’s very real.// Howard: Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.// Raj: See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.// Howard: I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.// Raj: You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.// Howard: You got it.// Raj: No jokes about the year I took ballet.// Howard: You took ballet?// Raj: God, you never listen.// Leonard: Are you sure you want to do this?// Sheldon: The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.// Leonard: What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?// Penny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll): Oh my God, I do look like that.// (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll)// Sheldon: You stop it.// Penny: So, how do you want me to cut it?// Sheldon: Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?// Leonard: So, business in the front, science in the back.// Penny: Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.// Sheldon: Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.// Penny: Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?// Leonard: That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?// Sheldon: Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.// Penny: Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.// Sheldon: Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.// Penny: Okay, what do you think?// Sheldon: Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?// Leonard: It actually looks good, Sheldon.// Penny: Doesn’t it?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.// Amy: Sorry I’m late. What did you do?// Penny: I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?// Amy: Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.// Sheldon: She’s right. I’m too hot.// Scene: A restaurant.// Bernadette: I’m excited to meet Emily.// Howard: Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.// Bernadette: Why would you say that?// Howard: Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.// Bernadette: How?// Howard: In a bad way, very bad.// Raj: Hey, guys.// Howard: Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.// Raj: Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.// Emily: Nice to meet you.// Bernadette: Hi.// Emily: Have we met before?// Howard: Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.// Emily: You sure? You look familiar.// Howard: Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.// Emily: Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?// Howard: That must be it.// Raj: Since when do you go to spin class?// Howard: Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?// Amy: Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?// Sheldon: Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?// Penny: Wait. What’s wrong with geology?// Sheldon: Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.// Sheldon: Have you considered studying standard model physics?// Sheldon: You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?// Penny: Like you could get a brown bear.// Leonard: Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.// Amy: Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.// Sheldon: Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.// Leonard: What about loop quantum gravity?// Sheldon: Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.// Penny: Who’s the duchess?// Leonard: One of the people that lives in his head.// Amy: I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.// Leonard: Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend.// Penny: Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.// Sheldon: That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.// Amy: How does that happen?// Sheldon: A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.// Penny: Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?// Sheldon: Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?// Penny: And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!// Scene: The restaurant.// Bernadette: Emily, what do you do?// Emily: I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.// Raj: Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.// Emily: This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.// Raj: Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.// Emily: Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?// Howard: It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…// Emily: Oh, my God, I remember.// Howard: Can I finish my astronaut story?// Emily: It was four years ago.// Howard: Please don’t say it.// Emily: We were set up on a blind date.// Emily: You came to my apartment.// Howard: You’re saying it.// Raj: Wh, what happened?// Bernadette: Yeah, what happened?// Howard: Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.// Bernadette: Please don’t say it.// Howard: One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.// Emily: You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.// Howard: I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.// Emily: Right, just water.// Howard: Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.// Emily: It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.// Raj: Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!// Howard: Yeah, yeah, I get it.// Bernadette: Howie.// Howard: Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you.// Amy: Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink.// Sheldon: No more than Penny.// Amy: That’s what I’m saying.// Sheldon: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Bernadette: So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?// Emily: I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.// Bernadette: You’re kidding, right?// Raj: She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.// Howard: Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.// Bernadette: Howie, we moved on a long time ago.// Howard: I’m just saying…// Bernadette: We moved on.// Howard: Okay. Fine.// Bernadette: How’s your soup?// Howard: Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.// Bernadette: Where are you going?// Howard: I need some fresh air.// Emily: Been there.// Scene: Sheldon, waking up in bed next to a Geology book.// Sheldon: Oh, no. What have I done?// Leonard: How you feeling?// Sheldon: Not so good.// Leonard: Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?// Sheldon: It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.// Leonard: I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.// Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?// Leonard: After she put you to bed, she went home.// Sheldon: Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.// Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office.// Answerphone: First new message.// Sheldon (voice): Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.// (voice)// Scene: The cafeteria..// Howard: You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?// Sheldon: Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.// Howard: Ugh. Me, too. What happened?// Sheldon: I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.// Howard: I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour.// Sheldon: Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?// Howard: Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.// Sheldon: Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.// Barry: Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.// Howard: Get out of here, Barry.// Barry: Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.// Sheldon: Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.// Answerphone: Next message.// Sheldon (voice): It’s me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together.// Sheldon (voice): Do you know what’s great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That’s fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.// Sheldon (voice): Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.// Sheldon (voice): Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I’m you. Get it?// Sheldon (voice): Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you’re mad at me. I’m so sorry. Beep bop boop bop.// Sheldon (voice): Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That’s even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?// Stephen Hawking: What a jackass.Series 07 Episode 21 – The Anything Can Happen Recurrence// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.// Leonard: Okay.// Penny: But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.// Leonard: It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.// Penny: Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.// Sheldon: Leonard, I could use your assistance.// Leonard: Sure. What’s up?// Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?// Leonard: Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.// Sheldon: That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…// Penny: Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?// Leonard: Thank you.// Penny: Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?// Sheldon: It is just so frustrating.// Penny: ‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.// Leonard: Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?// Penny: Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?// Leonard: You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.// Penny: Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?// Sheldon: All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.// Leonard: Great, what do you want to do?// Sheldon: I don’t know. What do you want to do?// Penny: I don’t know. What do you want to do?// Leonard: I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.// Credits sequence.// Sheldon: Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?// Leonard: What can we do that’s different?// Penny: What can we do that’s free?// Sheldon: Oh, got it. We order a pizza.// Penny: Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.// Sheldon: You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.// Penny: Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.// Leonard: You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.// Sheldon: Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: All right.// Leonard: Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?// Penny: No. Bernadette’s working late.// Sheldon: Amy’s sick.// Leonard: Aw. What’s wrong with her?// Sheldon: Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.// Leonard: That’s not what I meant.// Sheldon: Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?// Leonard: What ails her?// Sheldon: Oh. Who knows?// Penny: Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.// Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.// Howard: Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.// Raj: No problem. How’s your mom feeling?// Howard: Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine.// Raj: You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.// Howard: Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?// Raj: I was thinking we could watch a DVD.// Howard: Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.// Raj: Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?// Howard: A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.// Raj: I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.// Howard: That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.// Raj: Uh, so, you’ll watch it?// Howard: Sure.// Raj: You’re a good friend. I owe you one.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard. Help me get out of the tub.// (off)// Raj: Not that one.// Scene: The street.// Sheldon: So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?// Penny: Yep.// Sheldon: Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.// Leonard: Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?// Sheldon: Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.// Penny: What the hell? What? She’s not working late.// Sheldon: And Amy doesn’t look sick.// Penny: Why would they lie to us?// Sheldon: That’s a good question. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Raj: Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.// Howard: I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you.// Raj: You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.// Howard: Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets.// Raj: All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it.// Howard: Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie.// Scene: A bar.// Penny: You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?// Sheldon: And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.// Amy: I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.// Bernadette: We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.// Amy: But none of that means we don’t love you.// Penny: I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?// Leonard: I also love you.// Penny: Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Where are we going?// Penny: We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do.// Sheldon: Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…// Penny: Shut up.// Scene: A restaurant. Sheldon makes an “unsure” noise.// Penny: What’s wrong?// Sheldon: I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.// Penny: It’s fusion.// Sheldon: My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.// Penny: Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?// Sheldon: Not at all.// Penny: Thank you.// Sheldon: But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.// Penny: Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.// Sheldon: I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.// Raj: Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.// Howard: And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.// Raj: On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?// Howard: What difference does it make?// Raj: What do you mean?// Howard: Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her.// Raj: I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.// Scene: The bar.// Amy: I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?// Bernadette: I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.// Leonard: He’d probably give you homework.// Amy: Did you lie to Howard about tonight?// Bernadette: Of course.// Amy: And you don’t feel guilty about it?// Bernadette: Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice.// Leonard: Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.// Bernadette: Oh, we know you don’t lie to her.// Scene: The restaurant.// Penny: Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.// Sheldon: Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch.// Penny: Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.// Sheldon: This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here.// Penny: Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one.// Sheldon: No, it’s not.// Penny: How is that not good?// Sheldon: Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.// Penny: Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours.// Sheldon: Have you ever paid for a meal?// Penny: Not with money. Read.// Sheldon: Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.// Penny: Oh, try again.// Howard: Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.// Raj: I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?// Howard: Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. (Phone rings) Hey, Penny. What’s up? No, Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.// (Phone rings)// Raj: What?// Howard: I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.// Scene: The street. Outside a psychic’s shop.// Penny: Oh, I think I see our next stop.// Sheldon: You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.// Penny: No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.// Sheldon: Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.// Scene: Outside the bar.// Bernadette (on phone): Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on.// (on phone)// Leonard: You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?// Amy: I know, it’s weird, right?// Leonard: Yeah. We should do it more often.// Amy: Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.// Leonard: (Phone text sound) Ah, it’s Penny.// (Phone text sound)// Amy: Is she still mad?// Leonard: Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.// Amy: A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.// Leonard: Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do.// Amy: Because she has sex with you.// Leonard: Yeah, she does.// Amy: Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.// Leonard: Really?// Amy: I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.// Leonard: Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.// Amy: Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already.// Leonard: Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.// Amy: Really? What did you do?// Leonard: Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.// Bernadette: I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.// Scene: The psychic shop.// Sheldon: I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.// Penny: All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.// Sheldon: Okay, I just did. What was it?// Penny: Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.// Sheldon: For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.// Penny: Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.// Psychic: All right, why don’t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with.// Sheldon: That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.// Psychic: Yes, you clearly are. But I’m seeing a specific woman that you’re in a romantic relationship with.// Penny: Oh, oh, here we go.// Psychic: Does she have dark hair?// Penny: Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.// Sheldon: The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.// Psychic: Does she work in a similar field to you?// Sheldon: Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.// Psychic: They’re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.// Penny: Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?// Psychic: He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.// Penny: Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.// Psychic: Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.// Sheldon: You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey.// Penny: Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj: Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.// Emily: Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.// Raj: Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.// Emily: Okay.// Raj: And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.// Emily: I wonder that, too.// Raj: Then, why do you watch these things?// Emily: Can I tell you something without you judging me?// Raj: Sure.// Emily: They kind of turn me on.// Raj: And play.// Sheldon: Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening.// Amy: Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.// Sheldon: And how do you propose to do that? (Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl) Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re going with this.// (Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl)Series 07 Episode 22 – The Proton Transmogrification// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.// Penny: What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?// Howard: No. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s Wookiee Life Day.// Penny: So, when is it?// Leonard: Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth.// Sheldon: Get it?// Raj: May the fourth be with you?// Leonard: May the force be with you. Get it?// Penny: Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. There is a knock on the door.// Sheldon: Come in.// Leonard: Hey, you got a second?// Sheldon: Yes. Actually, I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time.// Leonard: Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news.// Sheldon: What is it?// Leonard: I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.// Sheldon: Professor Proton is dead?// Leonard: Sorry, buddy.// Sheldon: What are you doing?// Leonard: Comforting you?// Sheldon: Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t.// Leonard: Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday.// Sheldon: But, that’s Star Wars Day.// Leonard: Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.// Sheldon: I’m fine.// Leonard: Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Professor Proton (on youtube): This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can’t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn’t that a hoot? We’ll be right back after I fire my writers. (Owl hoots) Oh, shut up.// (on youtube)// (Owl hoots)// Amy: Watching your old friend?// Sheldon: Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.// Amy: Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m not going to the funeral.// Amy: Why not?// Sheldon: All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.// Amy: Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?// Sheldon: Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.// Amy: And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?// Sheldon: If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.// Penny: Hey, guys.// Raj: Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.// Penny: Okay.// Raj: Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.// Penny: No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.// Howard: You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?// Raj: And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.// Penny: Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?// Raj: Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?// Sheldon: Uh, no, thank you.// Howard: You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?// Penny: Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?// Sheldon: Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?// Penny: No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?// Sheldon: Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day.// Leonard: He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?// Raj: Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.// Penny: Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.// Scene: Amy”s apartment.// Amy: Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.// Bernadette: Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.// Amy: No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.// Bernadette: Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.// Amy: Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating.// Bernadette: This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.// Amy: I wonder why that is.// Scene: The funeral.// Penny: I have a confession to make.// Leonard: Hmm?// Penny: I’ve never been to a funeral before.// Leonard: Really?// Penny: I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.// Leonard: Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.// Penny: I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.// Leonard: I know.// Penny: I feel like I want to cry.// Leonard: Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.// Penny: I can’t do it with you staring at me.// Leonard: Sorry.// Penny: No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.// Leonard: I am not a crybaby.// Penny: Toy Story 3?// Leonard: The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.// Penny: It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.// Leonard: I got your back.// Penny: Yeah.// Sheldon: Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.// Raj: Ugh, let’s get this over with.// Howard: Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.// Sheldon: Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.// Raj: You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.// Howard: Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.// Sheldon: Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?// Raj: It was just a suggestion.// Sheldon: Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.// Raj: Wow.// Howard: I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.// Raj: Should we try to console him?// Howard: Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?// Raj: By staying here and watching the movie.// Howard: That’s what good friends would do.// Scene: Later.// Howard: Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.// Raj: Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.// Howard: Me, too.// Raj: Maybe we should see how he’s doing.// Howard: Yeah.// Raj: But after the cantina scene.// Howard: Obviously.// Scene: Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop.// Sheldon: Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.// Arthur: You never heard it that time.// Sheldon: Arthur. I thought you were dead.// Arthur: I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years.// Sheldon: Why are you here?// Arthur: I don’t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.// Sheldon: I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.// Arthur: I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?// Sheldon: Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.// Arthur: Well, that, that clears that up.// Sheldon: You must be here to give me advice.// Arthur: Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.// Sheldon: Those are your Jedi robes.// Arthur: Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?// Sheldon: Be careful with that.// Arthur: Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I’m, uh, I’m going to need a Band-Aid.// Leonard: So, what did you think of your first funeral?// Penny: Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.// Leonard: Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.// Penny: You think about dying?// Leonard: Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.// Penny: What would you regret?// Leonard: Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.// Penny: You know Klingon.// Leonard: That’s true.// Penny: No, I meant that as a regret.// Leonard: I just thought of one more.// Penny: What’s that?// Leonard: I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.// Penny: Well, it just wasn’t the right time.// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny: And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.// Leonard: What?// Penny: I know that face. That’s your propose face.// Leonard: I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.// Penny: What’s two to one?// Leonard: I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.// Penny: Oh, my. It’s not a contest.// Leonard: I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.// Penny: Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?// Leonard: Yeah, I think I would.// Penny: Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?// Leonard: Hmm.// Penny: No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.// Leonard: It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.// Amy: Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?// Bernadette: No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.// Amy: I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.// Bernadette: Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.// Amy: That’s cute.// Bernadette: Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?// Amy: Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.// Bernadette: Girl Sprouts?// Amy: My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.// Bernadette: How did that get you into science?// Amy: Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Leonard: On the one hand, if I say yes…// Penny: This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?// Leonard: Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?// Penny: No.// Leonard: Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.// Penny: You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.// Leonard: Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.// Penny: Thank you.// Leonard: Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…// Scene: Sheldon’s dream.// Arthur: Where, where, where are we?// Sheldon: This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.// Arthur: Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.// Sheldon: When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?// Arthur: Um, always, get, get a prenup.// Sheldon: That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.// Arthur: Well, why, why do you think I’m here?// Sheldon: I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.// Arthur: Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?// Sheldon: Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.// Arthur: Yeah, I’ve, I’ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.// Sheldon: Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.// Arthur: I’m, I’m sorry about that.// Sheldon: And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.// Arthur: Well, you know, it’s, it’s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.// Sheldon: But I do appreciate them.// Arthur: Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)// (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)// Leonard: Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?// Sheldon: I’m okay. How was the funeral?// Leonard: It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?// (Sheldon hugs him)// Sheldon: I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.// Leonard: Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night.// Sheldon: That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap.// Howard: Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.// Leonard: At least they toned him down in the second one.// Penny: Yeah, he is pretty stupid.// Raj: Hey, we can say it. You can’t.// Amy: Hey, guys.// Bernadette: Happy Star Wars Day.// Sheldon: Wow. A Death Star cake.// Amy: Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.// Bernadette: And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.// Howard: Well, you didn’t miss anything. We just started over.// Bernadette: Son of a bitch.// Scene: The same, everyone is falling asleep.// Sheldon: You’re back.// Arthur: Yeah, apparently, um, I’m here whenever, when, whenever you need me.// Sheldon: That’s nice.// Arthur: May, maybe for you.// Sheldon: Why do I need you now?// Arthur: Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you’re, you’re dreaming you’re watching Star Wars.// Sheldon: So?// Arthur: I mean, don’t, don’t you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you’re spending your limited time on Earth?// Sheldon: Not at all.// Arthur: Okay, good luck to you.Series 07 Episode 23 – The Gorilla Dissolution// Scene: The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Bernadette: Almost there. You’re doing great.// Howard: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.// Raj: Please hurry.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t need a treadmill.// (off)// Howard: The doctor says you need to get exercise.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise.// Howard: Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.// Raj: If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?// Howard: She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.// Raj: All right. Now what?// Bernadette: We set it up in Howie’s old room.// Raj: Do you know how to set it up?// Howard: Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Raj: So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.// Leonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.// Amy: Should we do something for her?// Sheldon: I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.// Amy: Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.// Sheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Hey, how were things on the set?// Penny: Uh, pretty good, actually.// Raj: So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?// Penny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.// Amy: Good for you.// Penny: Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.// Leonard: I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.// Sheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.// Leonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.// Sheldon: I know.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Howard: Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.// Bernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.// Howard: You mean a forklift?// Bernadette: Howie.// Howard: I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.// Bernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?// Howard: Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?// Bernadette: I would do it for my mother.// Howard: Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.// Bernadette: Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?// Howard: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.// Bernadette: You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.// Howard: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle.// Howard: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?// Bernadette: You are a putz.// Howard: As advertised.// Scene: A cinema.// Sheldon: Thanks for coming with me.// Raj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?// Sheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.// Raj: Is that a real thing?// Sheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.// Raj: Emily, Hey.// Emily: Oh, hey, Raj.// Raj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.// Sheldon: Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?// Emily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start.// Raj: Are you here alone?// Emily: No, not really.// Raj: What do you mean, not really?// Man: Hey, should we get our seats?// Emily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.// Raj: Yeah, okay.// Sheldon: That was awkward, right?// Raj: Uh-huh.// Sheldon: Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?// Raj: Yes.// Sheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.// Scene: The movie set.// Director: And action.// Wil Wheaton: Please don’t shut me out.// Penny: Go away. Just go away.// Wil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.// Penny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?// Wil: I was trying to save your life.// Penny: Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.// Wil: You can’t give up. I love you.// Penny: I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.// Director: And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene.// Penny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.// Director: Let’s just move on. No one cares.// Penny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?// Director: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it.// Leonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.// Director: And who are you?// Leonard: I’m her boyfriend.// Director: Isn’t she too hot for you?// Leonard: A little, yeah.// Director: Well, boyfriend, get off my set.// Penny: You can’t do that. He’s with me.// Director: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired.// Penny: What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.// Director: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.// Wil: Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.// Scene: A bar.// Wil: Wow, that fell apart really fast.// Raj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.// Sheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.// Raj: You don’t have to make me anything.// Sheldon: No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?// Raj: Sorry, I left them in my turban.// Sheldon: Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?// Raj: Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?// Sheldon: Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.// Raj: But you don’t have sex with her, either.// Sheldon: Slick, huh?// Raj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.// Sheldon: Have you had intercourse?// Raj: No.// Sheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m hungry again.// Howard: It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.// Bernadette: You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.// Howard: No, it’s not.// Bernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.// Howard: Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.// Bernadette: I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.// Howard: Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m still hungry.// Howard: I’m coming, you big baby.// Scene: The bar.// Penny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.// Wil: Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing.// Penny: Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.// Wil: Hey. I just lost a job for you.// Penny: All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.// Wil: Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.// (Text message tone)// Penny: God, what am I doing with my life?// Leonard: You having second thoughts about acting?// Penny: You were on set, you saw what it was like.// Leonard: Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.// Penny: Oh, really?// Leonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?// Penny: It was over a bowling alley.// Leonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking.// Penny: Are you done?// Leonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial.// Penny: It was for haemorrhoid cream.// Leonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.// Penny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.// Leonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?// Penny: Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.// Raj: I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?// Sheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night.// Raj: What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.// Sheldon: That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.// Raj: What do you mean?// Sheldon: How many women have you had dates with?// Raj: Eleven.// Sheldon: How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?// Raj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?// Sheldon: Sure.// Raj: I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.// Sheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?// Raj: Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.// Sheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.// Bernadette: Howie, I’m back!// Howard: Shh, I just got her to sleep.// Bernadette: Sorry.// Howard: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.// Bernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.// Howard: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?// Bernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.// Howard: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.// Bernadette: Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.// Howard: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.// Bernadette: I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard.// Howard: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj: Hey.// Emily: Thanks for letting me come over.// Raj: Of course. Please, come in.// Emily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay.// Raj: Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.// Emily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.// Raj: It’s okay.// Emily: Really?// Raj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.// Emily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset.// Raj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.// Emily: Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.// Raj: Well, me, neither.// Emily: Okay.// Raj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?// Emily: Yeah.// Raj: I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.// Emily: That’s cool.// Raj: It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?// Emily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.// Raj: It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.// Emily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?// Raj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Oh, my God. What a day.// Leonard: Can I get you anything?// Penny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions.// Leonard: With your career?// Penny: With my life.// Leonard: Like what?// Penny: I don’t know. We could get married.// Leonard: Come on, be serious.// Penny: I am.// Leonard: Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?// Penny: Well, yeah.// Leonard: So I’m like a bran muffin.// Penny: What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.// Leonard: No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.// Penny: What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.// Leonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.// Penny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.// Leonard: No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.// Penny: You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.// Leonard: You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.// Penny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.// Leonard: Then what do you need?// Penny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart.// Leonard: Oh. Then I guess I’m in.// Penny: Really? You guess you’re in?// Leonard: Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!// Penny: Okay. Leonard: Cool.// Leonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?// Penny: Yeah, I think so.// Leonard: All right.// Penny: What’s wrong?// Leonard: I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.// Penny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?// Leonard: Oh, I know. This might help.// Penny: Where did you get a ring?// Leonard: I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?// Penny: Oh, my God, yes.// Leonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.// Howard: How you feeling?// Bernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this.// Howard: I’m proud of us.// Bernadette: Me, too.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where’s my pancakes?!// Foreign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!// Bernadette: You were right.// Howard: Welcome to Team Putz.Series 07 Episode 24 – The Status Quo Combustion// Scene: The Apartment.// Leonard: How’s your mom holding up?// Howard: She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.// Amy: How many is that now?// Howard: Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them.// Bernadette: She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.// Sheldon: So, who’s watching her now?// Howard: A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.// Raj: What up, guys?// All: Hello, hey!// Leonard: Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged.// General cheering and congratulations.// Raj: And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.// Leonard: Hey, hey, what the hell?// Bernadette: You guys propose all the time. This never happens.// Penny: You’re right! Yay!// Credits sequence.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?// Howard: Because you had sex the other night?// Raj: You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.// Leonard: Hey, buddy.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: You okay?// Sheldon: I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.// Howard: Why?// Sheldon: He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face.// Leonard: That’s a rude thing to say, out loud.// Sheldon: It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university.// Howard: You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.// Leonard: Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions.// Sheldon: I don’t know. I am really aggravated.// Raj: When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Howard: Oh, come on, give her a chance.// Nurse: No. Life, it is too short.// Bernadette: I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people.// Howard: Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea.// Bernadette: That’s not helpful.// Howard: Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months.// Bernadette: But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.// Howard: Well, what if we use our vacation time?// Bernadette: I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.// Howard: I don’t know what else we can do.// Bernadette: Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.// Scene: The apartment.// Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.// (on webcam)// Leonard: Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.// Mrs Hofstadter: I’m listening.// Leonard: Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?// Mrs Hofstadter: No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.// Leonard: I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.// Mrs Hofstadter: Would you like for you and me to talk more?// Leonard: You know what? It’s probably fine.// Mrs Hofstadter: In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me.// Leonard: I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?// Mrs Hofstadter: Sure.// Leonard: Thanks, Mom.// Mrs Hofstadter: Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?// Leonard: Yes, it would.// Mrs Hofstadter: Yeah. Well, you should work on that.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny (on phone): No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.// (on phone)// Amy: Atomic magnets?// Penny: Shut up.// Bernadette: Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.// Penny: You want some wine?// Bernadette: Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family.// Penny: I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.// Bernadette: It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.// Amy: So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?// Penny: Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.// Amy: Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.// Bernadette: You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?// Penny: Not a chance.// Bernadette: Please. I’m desperate.// Penny: No.// Bernadette: I’ll pay you anything you want.// Penny: Okay, then, yeah.// Penny: No, keep your money.// Bernadette: I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.// Leonard: What you working on?// Sheldon: I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.// Leonard: Oh. How’s it going?// Sheldon: You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand.// Leonard: It’s nice that you called them esteemed.// Sheldon: You’re right. I’ll take that out.// Leonard: So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.// Sheldon: Mm.// Leonard: Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.// Sheldon: Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.// Leonard: I’m not.// Sheldon: Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.// Leonard: Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.// Sheldon: What do you mean?// Leonard: Well, well, we might want to live together.// Sheldon: Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.// Leonard: That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.// Sheldon: I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?// Leonard: Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.// Sheldon: Where are you going to go?// Leonard: I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.// Sheldon: Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?// Leonard: No, I did not.// Sheldon: Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?// Leonard: Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.// Sheldon: I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.// Leonard: Well, yeah.// Sheldon: Wow.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?// Amy: They just don’t appreciate you.// Sheldon: Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.// Amy: Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.// Sheldon: I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.// Amy: You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.// Sheldon: Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.// Amy: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.// Sheldon: Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?// Amy: See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.// Sheldon: I don’t know. Perhaps.// Amy: And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together.// Sheldon: You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?// Amy: Sheldon, it was just a thought.// Sheldon: No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder.// Amy: It tastes the same.// Sheldon: No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.// Penny: This is so sweet. You never cook for me.// Leonard: Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.// Penny: If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?// Leonard: It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.// Penny: Sorry. I’ll get better.// Leonard: I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?// Penny: Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.// Leonard: Okay. And when would that be?// Penny: Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.// Amy: Hi, is Sheldon here?// Leonard: No, I thought he was with you.// Amy: He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone.// Leonard: What happened?// Amy: He was really angry that you suggested he move out.// Leonard: Oh.// Amy: I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.// Leonard: Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.// Amy: You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?// Penny: Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.// Amy: That’s nice.// Leonard: Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.// Amy: Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?// Penny: Amy, get out.// Amy: Right.// Scene: The comic book store.// Sheldon: No.// Stuart: Hey, Sheldon.// Sheldon: What happened?// Stuart: I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.// Sheldon: And you couldn’t put it out?// Stuart: I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.// Sheldon: So when will you reopen?// Stuart: Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.// Sheldon: So, tomorrow?// Stuart: I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.// Sheldon: Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny.// Stuart: Well, sorry I let you down.// Sheldon: No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.// Stuart: That’ll be $2.99.// Sheldon: Really? It’s soaking wet.// Stuart: Fine, a dollar.// Sheldon: Can you break a twenty?// Stuart: No, I only have hundreds.// Sheldon: You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.// Stuart: (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before) That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break.// (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before)// Leonard: I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?// Penny: Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.// Leonard: I’m gonna see where he is.// Penny: How?// Leonard: Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.// Penny: You do that?// Leonard: Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.// Penny: He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.// Leonard: That’s weird.// Penny: What?// Leonard: He’s at the train station.// Penny: So? He loves trains.// Leonard: It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.// Penny: It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.// Leonard: It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.// Raj: Dude, I’m so sorry.// Howard: Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?// Stuart: No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.// Raj: We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?// Stuart: Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.// Raj: Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.// Stuart: You slept with her? Nice.// Raj: Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.// Howard: Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.// Stuart: Great.// Howard: I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.// Stuart: So what’s the catch?// Scene: The train station.// Leonard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: You tracked my phone?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.// Penny: We were worried about you.// Sheldon: Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.// Leonard: Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.// Sheldon: My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.// Leonard: Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home.// Sheldon: No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.// Penny: And go where?// Sheldon: It doesn’t matter.// Leonard: So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?// Sheldon: I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.// Leonard: Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland.// Sheldon: Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.// Leonard: Then what can I do?// Sheldon: Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.// Leonard: Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting.// Penny: Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.// Leonard: What? Why?// Penny: It might be good for him.// Leonard: You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.// Penny: He’s a grown man.// Leonard: No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.// Penny: Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.// Leonard: I know, but…// Penny: He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.// Sheldon: Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.// Penny: Seriously, let him go.// Leonard: Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way.// Sheldon: I do.// Leonard: Okay. Good luck.// Penny: Be safe and call us.// Sheldon: I will.// Leonard: Bye, buddy. Sheldon?// Sheldon: Yes?// Leonard: I’m gonna miss you.// Sheldon: Of course you are.// Leonard: He just made that easier.// Penny: Mm.// Stuart: Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.// Howard: You sure?// Stuart: Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked in and watching TV.// Bernadette: So, she’s not too much for you?// Stuart: Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?// (off)// Stuart: Coming, Debbie.// Howard: You call her Debbie?// Stuart: She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.// Howard: Was that a little weird?// Bernadette: Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.// Howard: Okay, let’s go.// Bernadette: Yep.// Amy (on phone): Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.// Leonard: He’s okay?// Amy: Actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.// Penny: I really think this is gonna be for the best.// Leonard: Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…// Amy: How could you let him go?"
8,"Series 08 Episode 01 – The Locomotion Interruption// Following a “previously on” sequence.// Scene: A railway station. Sheldon is wearing no trousers.// Sheldon: Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?// Man: I don’t think so.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Morning.// Penny: Hi. Want to do yoga with me?// Leonard: Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that. (Phone rings) Hello?// (Phone rings)// Sheldon: Hello, Leonard.// Leonard: Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.// Sheldon: Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.// Leonard: I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.// Sheldon: Leonard, I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.// Leonard: Oh, my God, are you okay?// Sheldon: No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs.// Leonard: Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?// Penny: Hey, what’s going on?// Leonard: He got all of his stuff stolen.// Penny: Oh.//  // Sheldon: 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,// Leonard: Okay.// Sheldon: Hurry.// Leonard: Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?// Sheldon: Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence.// Leonard: I’ll be there as soon as I can.// Penny: Is he okay?// Leonard: Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled.// Leonard: Feel like driving to Arizona with me?// Penny: I can’t, I have that job interview.// Leonard: Oh, right.// Penny: Besides, I don’t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath until your hair grows back.// Leonard: All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?// Penny: Nope.// Leonard: Come on, you didn’t even try.// Scene: Howard’s car.// Raj: Thanks for the lift.// Howard: What’s wrong with your car?// Raj: I’m having my windows untinted.// Howard: Why?// Raj: Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.// Howard: What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention to you.// Raj: Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the way to work.// Howard: I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay.// Raj: I thought Stuart was looking after her.// Howard: He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.// Raj: How so?// Howard: I don’t know, they’re, chummy.// Raj: Like us?// Howard: No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.// Raj: She feeds him out of her own mouth?// Howard: I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.// Raj: So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?// Howard: First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.// Raj: Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active…// Howard: I said well past it.// Scene: Kingman Police Station.// Sheldon: Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?// Hernandez: Not yet.// Sheldon: Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?// Hernandez: Nope.// Sheldon: Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Leonard: Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.// Amy: My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,// Leonard: Yeah, time’s gonna fly by.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Penny: I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really nervous.// Bernadette: Don’t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things.// Penny: I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.// Bernadette: This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.// Penny: They do?// Bernadette: Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you.// Penny: Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head.// Bernadette: You’ll be fine. Just be yourself.// Penny: I wish I felt more confident.// Bernadette: Penny, I wouldn’t have put you up for this job if I didn’t think you could handle it.// Penny: Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.// Bernadette: It’s too late to cancel. You’re going.// Penny: But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.// Bernadette: Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?// Penny: They’re comfortable.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Howard: Ma, I hope you’re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.// Stuart: Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?// Howard: Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.// Stuart: Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn’t have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious.// Howard: It’s not that precious.// Raj: I’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, I can’t find my glasses.// (off)// Stuart: Be right there, Deb Deb. They’re probably on her head.// Howard: Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.// Stuart: Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you’d know.// Raj: It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.// Sheldon: Any word on my stolen items?// Hernandez: We’re doing everything we can.// Sheldon: You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.// Leonard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Leonard. Oh, I’m so happy to see you.// Amy: Are you okay?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?// Amy: What do you mean, why did I come? You’re my boyfriend. I haven’t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?// Sheldon: I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.// Amy: Fine. Whisper it.// Sheldon (whispers): Shotgun.// (whispers)// Leonard: So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?// Sheldon: Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.// Leonard: How were they?// Sheldon: Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.// Leonard: Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?// Sheldon: Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are.// Leonard: I’m sorry, so you never went outside?// Sheldon: Or had a single piece of fruit.// Scene: Pharmaceutical Company Office.// Dan: So, why do you think you’d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?// Penny: Well, I’m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I’m saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I’m done.// Dan: You sure?// Penny: People. Yes.// Dan: Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?// Penny: Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.// Dan: Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.// Penny: People.// Howard: It’s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother.// Raj: That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.// Howard: Come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?// Raj: I don’t know. I mean, she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They’re both adults.// Howard: Who cares? You wouldn’t care if I slept with your mom?// Raj: You know what? You’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.// Howard: This is stupid. I’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.// Raj: ‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do.// Stuart (voice on answerphone): This is Debbie.// (voice on answerphone)// Mrs Wolowitz (voice on answerphone): And this is Stuart.// Together: Just kidding.// Stuart (voice on answerphone): Leave a message.// Raj: This is the part where you talk.// Dan: All right, let’s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor’s drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?// Penny: Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I’m really sorry for wasting your time.// Dan: Don’t worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.// Penny: Okay, thanks. Um, I’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a, a little terrified of her.// Dan: Wait, wait. You’re scared of Bernadette?// Penny: Yeah, kind of.// Dan: I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she’s so nice with that squeaky little voice.// Penny: I know, but she’s kind of a bully.// Dan: Wll, she is. I didn’t even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.// Penny: Me, too.// Dan: Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing.// Penny: What happened?// Dan: I couldn’t do it. She’s still working on it. Oh, we’re not gonna tell her about this, right?// Penny: Oh, my God, no.// Sheldon: At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?// Leonard: I don’t care.// Sheldon: Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?// Amy: Have you not noticed that I’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?// Sheldon: I just thought you were bad at the game.// Amy: I’m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?// Sheldon: Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?// Amy: We’re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?// Sheldon: Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own.// Leonard: What’s the big deal?// Sheldon: Oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.// Leonard: Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me.// Amy: Can I stop now?// Leonard: Just tell her.// Sheldon: I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me.// Amy: You were worried about that?// Sheldon: Yes.// Amy: Sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect.// Sheldon: Can I have one more moment with Leonard?// Amy: Sure.// Sheldon: Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.// Howard: Now, I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of excited to see Sheldon.// Bernadette: I never thought I’d say this, but Penny got a job today.// Howard: She did?// Bernadette: Well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.// Howard (answering a knock on the door): What do you want?// (answering a knock on the door)// Stuart: I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom’s.// Howard: You’re right, I’m not. I think it’s weird.// Bernadette: Howie?// Howard: It is. He’s a grown man. He’s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?// Stuart: Hey, you’re not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking…// Howard: Your mother and I? You’re not my father.// Stuart: I didn’t say I was your father.// Howard: Well, I didn’t say I was your father.// Bernadette: Okay, calm down. You’re not his father, he’s not your father. Nobody’s anybody’s father.// Stuart: I, I’m sorry you don’t like my life choices, but it’s my life.// Howard: Well, it’s my house, it’s my rules.// Stuart: Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?// Bernadette: Hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him.// Stuart: I don’t have to listen to you.// Howard: Don’t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.// Stuart: You know what? This isn’t getting us anywhere. When you’re ready to apologize, you know where to find me.// Howard: Yeah, in my house.// Stuart: That’s right, sucka.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.// Amy: But you still accomplished something.// Leonard: Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?// Sheldon: That I couldn’t do it?// Leonard: Exactly. Right after they said yeah.// Amy: But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way? That’s what makes it an adventure.// Sheldon: That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks.// Amy: See? This trip was good for you.// Sheldon: Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly.// Leonard: Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.// Sheldon: Yeah, I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way.// All: Hey.// Penny: Hey, look who’s back.// Sheldon: Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out.// Sheldon: Would you like to see pictures from my trip?// Penny: I thought your phone got stolen.// Sheldon: Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.// Leonard: And you thought they all had a silver lining.// Sheldon: Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.// Penny: I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.// Sheldon: I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave out.Series 08 Episode 02 – The Junior Professor Solution// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.// Howard: What a sick use of science.// Raj: Hey, as long as the baby’s healthy.// Amy: I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.// Leonard: Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.// Howard: Yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.// Sheldon: Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked.// Raj: But half-man, half-owl could fly…// Sheldon: The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.// Howard: So, Penny, when’s the new job start?// Penny: Next Monday.// Bernadette: Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?// Penny: Uh, not yet, but I will.// Bernadette: Great. When?// Penny: I said I’ll get to it.// Sheldon: I’m sensing awkwardness, am I right?// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: Swish.// Bernadette: I don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.// Penny: Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They’ll tell me everything I need to know.// Bernadette: But imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.// Penny: Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?// Bernadette: Couldn’t hurt.// Leonard: Mm, I don’t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?// Sheldon: It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.// Scene: Mrs Davis’ office.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs. Davis. (Knock, knock, knock) Guess who?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Mrs Davis: Dr. Cooper.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) That’s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?// Mrs Davis: Yes. Uh, welcome back.// Sheldon: Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?// Mrs Davis: You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.// Sheldon: That’s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?// Mrs Davis: Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.// Sheldon: Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?// Mrs Davis: Currently, you’re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you’ll be able to choose whatever field of research you’d like.// Sheldon: But if I’m a professor, then I’ll have to teach a class.// Mrs Davis: That is correct.// Sheldon: So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?// Mrs Davis: Yes.// Sheldon: You people are sick.// Scene: Amy’s lab.// Penny: Hey. Ready to go to lunch?// Amy: Just give me a minute. I’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.// Penny: What happens if you don’t?// Amy: Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?// Penny: Uh, no. Actually, I didn’t invite her.// Amy: How come?// Penny: Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me.// Amy: Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.// Penny: That is not true.// Amy: I’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.// Penny: I told you, they’ll be right out.// Amy: Okay, so no Bernadette.// Penny: Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?// Amy: No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face.// Penny: I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her.// Amy: I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.// Penny: So, what are you saying?// Amy: I’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: So, I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?// Howard: Why is it your last name and her first name?// Raj: Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney.// Leonard: Hey, how’d it go with human resources?// Sheldon: Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.// Raj: I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?// Sheldon: What a stupid question.// Leonard: The kids are gonna love him.// Sheldon: I can’t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.// Leonard: This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong.// Sheldon: Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn’t mean I always do.// Raj: You enjoy giving people grades.// Sheldon: A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.// Howard: And you love the sound of your own voice.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It’s like an earful of melted caramel.// Leonard: Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.// Sheldon: It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That’s rich. I’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.// Amy: Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don’t you? That’s right, say my name.// Bernadette (on skype): Hey.// (on skype)// Amy: Hey, what’s going on?// Bernadette: Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?// Amy: No Penny?// Bernadette: Not tonight. I’m a little frustrated with her.// Amy: Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?// Bernadette: So it’s not just me. You see it, too.// Amy: I do, I see it.// Bernadette: It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.// Amy: That’s outrageous.// Bernadette: I know.// Amy: If she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you.// Bernadette: Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?// Amy: I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.// Scene: Sheldon’s classroom.// Leonard: Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?// Sheldon: There is no class.// Howard: Did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?// Sheldon: No one signed up.// Leonard: Well, that’s not your fault.// Sheldon: I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.// Leonard: What?// Raj: Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry.// Sheldon: No, it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.// Raj: Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?// Sheldon: Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away.// Howard: Hey, what if I took your class?// Sheldon: Why would you do that?// Leonard: Yeah, why would you do that?// Raj: What’s wrong with you?// Howard: I’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?// Sheldon: Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about.// Raj: Ask why not again, I’ve got an answer.// Howard: Sheldon, I’m more than smart enough to take your class.// Sheldon: No.// Howard: Yes.// Sheldon: How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?// Howard: I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.// Sheldon: Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?// Howard: I’d use Feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign.// Sheldon: Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?// Howard: Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I’ll say that. Now do you think I’m smart enough?// Howard: Oh, come on. You might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.// Sheldon: You take that back.// Howard: No.// Scene: The stairwell.// Amy: So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I’m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.// Sheldon: I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?// Amy: Because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I’m in the centre now, and I love that even more.// Sheldon: Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.// Amy: But I’m just…// Sheldon: Not now.// Amy: You better watch that attitude, buddy. You’re dating the popular girl now.// Leonard: Hmm. You’re up late.// Sheldon: Oh, I’m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don’t really understand it.// Leonard: Sheldon, why are you doing this?// Sheldon: I’m a teacher, Leonard. It’s my job.// Leonard: No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?// Sheldon: Oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure.// Leonard: You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it.// Sheldon: Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.// Leonard: Might be something to think about.// Sheldon: Leonard?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?// Howard: Hey.// Sheldon: Okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin.// Howard: Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I’m out. But if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I’m willing to give this a shot.// Sheldon: I suppose that’s a fair request. There’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.// Howard: Okay.// Sheldon: Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?// Howard: I am.// Sheldon: Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?// Howard: It’s an inverted cycloid.// Sheldon: Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?// Howard: That’s where I’m a little fuzzy.// Sheldon: Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a C.// Howard (singing): All I do is win, win, win no matter what.// (singing)// Sheldon: What are you doing?// Howard (singing): Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!// Howard: If you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I’m gonna be a crappy student. (Singing) Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause I never been defeated and I won’t stop now…// (Singing)// Sheldon: Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.// Sheldon: Now, where was I? Let’s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?// Howard: Making a straw.// Sheldon: Why?// Howard: So I can shoot you with a spitball.// Sheldon: You’re not going to do that, and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!// Howard: Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don’t think I can do that again.// Amy (on phone): Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?// (on phone)// Penny: What?// Amy: Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.// Penny: Uh, thanks, but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.// Amy: Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?// Penny: No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So…// Amy: Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.// Bernadette: Hey, Amy.// Amy: Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.// Bernadette: That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I’d come by and help her study.// Amy: Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She’s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?// Bernadette: I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we’re good.// Amy: Oh. Great. I’m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.// Bernadette: Well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal.// Amy: You mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.// Sheldon: Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.// Sheldon: Well?// Leonard: Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.// Sheldon: Are you sure? It just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.// Howard: You reported me to human resources?// Sheldon: You violated the sanctity of my mouth.// Howard: Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you’re happy.// Sheldon: I told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.// Howard: I’m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. I could do the same to you.// Sheldon: Yeah, try me.// Howard: Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?// Sheldon: Young’s modulus.// Raj: Is that right?// Howard: Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?// Sheldon: Laminate the core material.// Leonard: Come on, give him a hard one.// Howard: That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don’t know, do you? What’s the matter, smart guy? Don’t know Poiseuille’s law?// Sheldon (coughing several times): Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.// (coughing several times)// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?// Penny: Headaches, dizziness and nausea.// Bernadette: Yes.// Penny: Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.// Bernadette: Want to stop here?// Penny: Uh, no. I can keep going.// Bernadette: Nah, you got this. Let’s go for a drink. I’ll call Amy.// Penny: Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.// Amy (phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny’s door): Hey, girl.// (phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny’s door)// Leonard: Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea// Raj: 250 million years.// Leonard: Yes. (Cheers)// (Cheers)// Howard: Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.// Sheldon: Oh! It’s not even Easter time. This is crazy.// Howard: Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?// All together: The Rhombicosidodecahedron. (Cheers)// Leonard: We are so smart.// Raj: Why didn’t girls like us in high school?// Howard: Because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!// Leonard: Right again. (Cheers)Series 08 Episode 03 – The First Pitch Insufficiency// Scene: The apartment.// Howard: So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?// Leonard: Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.// Howard: All right.// Raj: You suck, Wolowitz.// Howard: What’s that about?// Raj: I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.// Sheldon: He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck.// Penny: Hi. What’s going on?// Leonard: Baseball.// Penny: Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.// Leonard: He’s practicing.// Penny: For what?// Howard: The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?// Penny: What, you? Really?// Howard: Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me.// Penny: That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.// Sheldon: Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.// Penny: I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.// Leonard: C’mon now, throw one.// Howard: All right, here we go.// Raj: You look like a jackass.// Howard: Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings.// Leonard: Now you know why we’re not outside.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: Did you enjoy my lecture?// Amy: No, and neither did our waiter.// Sheldon: Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.// Amy: It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.// Penny: Hey, how was dinner?// Sheldon: Good, I had Cornish game hen.// Leonard: Oh, that poor waiter.// Amy: Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?// Penny: You guys are going out two nights in a row?// Sheldon: I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.// Penny: That’s so hot.// Amy: It’s better than hot, it’s binding.// Sheldon: If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date.// Penny: Aw.// Amy: You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Bernadette: I can’t believe you’re sore.// Howard: Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.// Bernadette: But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.// Howard: For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.// Bernadette: I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.// Howard: They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn’t say no.// Bernadette: Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.// Howard: Thank you, that would be great.// Bernadette: Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.// Howard: What’s wrong with the way I run?// Bernadette; Oh, just kidding. Nothing.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub.// Sheldon: At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.// Amy: I then suggested a pub.// Sheldon: Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.// Leonard: You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.// Sheldon: No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.// Amy: After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.// Leonard: Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.// Sheldon: Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours.// Penny: Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?// Sheldon: I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.// Leonard: You don’t honestly think that, do you?// Sheldon: Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.// Leonard: There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.// Penny: Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.// Leonard: That’s the part you have a problem with?// Penny: Relax.// Amy: There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.// Scene: A gymnasium.// Raj: So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?// Howard: Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.// Bernadette: All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.// Howard: Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?// Bernadette: Keep going.// Howard: How about now?// Bernadette: I’ll let you know.// Howard: Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?// Bernadette: Okay, stop.// Howard: Are you kidding me?!// Bernadette: That’s sixty feet.// Howard: There’s no way this is sixty feet.// Bernadette: I’m looking at it.// Howard: You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Leonard: Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?// Sheldon: For starters, we enjoy spending time together.// Leonard: So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.// Sheldon: It’s called parallel play.// Leonard: Yeah, toddlers do that.// Sheldon: Not as well as we do.// Leonard: You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.// Penny: So what? Why do you even care?// Sheldon: Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over.// Leonard: Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.// Sheldon: If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.// Amy: It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire.// Scene: The gym.// Bernadette: Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.// Howard: That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.// Bernadette: Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working with.// Raj: Come on Howard, fire it in.// Bernadette: Throw the damn ball!// Scene: The pub.// Amy: So when do you guys plan on getting married?// Penny: Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.// Sheldon: May I have one of your fries?// Amy: Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?// Sheldon: Absolutely not.// Leonard: Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.// Sheldon: It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?// Leonard: I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.// Sheldon: Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.// Leonard: How ridiculous is he?// Penny: A hundred.// Leonard: Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.// Sheldon: No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig.// Penny: Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.// Sheldon: Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.// Penny: Oh, what did those rascals do now?// Amy: They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.// Sheldon: Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.// Leonard: So, this is accurate?// Sheldon: It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.// Penny: Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.// Sheldon: Kind of? It does it perfectly.// Amy: Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.// Leonard: Fine. We’ll take it right now.// Penny: No, don’t.// Leonard: What?// Penny: Just don’t take it.// Leonard: Why not?// Penny: ‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?// Leonard: Come on. It’ll be fun.// Penny: I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.// Leonard: Sorry.// Amy: I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work.// Bernadette: Think he’s getting any better?// Raj: Yup.// Howard: That was a close one.// Bernadette: Okay.// Raj: Is it too late for him to cancel?// Bernadette: I think so.// Howard: Heads up! Watch out!// Leonard: Are you mad at me?// Penny: No, stop being stupid.// Leonard: Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?// Penny: Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.// Leonard: What are you worried about?// Penny: That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.// Leonard: Yeah, that scares me, too.// Penny: It does?// Leonard: Sometimes.// Penny: Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.// Leonard: Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.// Mike (on Skype): Hey, Froot Loops, what’s up?// (on Skype)// Howard: Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?// Mike: Yeah. Don’t do it. What else you up to?// Howard: Why shouldn’t I do it?// Mike: There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever.// Howard: But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?// Mike: That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.// Howard: Well, maybe I’ll do a good job.// Mike: I don’t know. In space, you couldn’t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.// Howard: Okay, thanks for the pep talk.// Mike: Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She’s so much cuter than you, I don’t know how you ever got her.// Bernadette: He’s so nice.// Penny: Hey, sorry about that.// Amy: No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.// Sheldon: Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.// Leonard: I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.// Sheldon: The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.// Leonard: I killed his Chewbacca slippers.// Penny: Let’s just take the test.// Leonard: No, no, no, I don’t want to.// Penny: Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.// Leonard: Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.// Sheldon: Or a one. A one is possible.// Leonard: Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.// Penny: Leonard.// Amy: It would make me so happy if you said things like that.// Sheldon: We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy.// Scene: Angels Stadium// Raj: Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.// Penny: Look at you, talking sports.// Leonard: This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.// Sheldon: Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.// Amy: Sheldon, what did you expect?// Sheldon: I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade.// Amy: I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.// Sheldon: Who’s the bobblehead of?// Amy: Does it matter?// Sheldon: No, as long as it bobbles.// Bernadette: Howie, I am so proud of you.// Howard: Thanks. I’m proud of me, too.// Man: You ready?// Howard: Let’s do it.// Man: All right.// Howard: Wish me luck.// Bernadette: Go get ’em.// Stadium Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.// Howard: Thank you. Thank you.// Penny: Can he really throw a ball?// Leonard: On our Quidditch team, he…// Penny: Yeah, that’s a no.// Howard: I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch.// Bernadette: Why is it going so slow?// Howard: ‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.// Sheldon: Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.// Howard: Okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about Mars.// Man in Crowd: You suck, Wolowitz!// Sheldon: He makes a valid point.// Howard: Okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster.Series 08 Episode 04 – The Hook-Up Reverbration// Scene: The cafeteria.// Leonard: Have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?// Sheldon: Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.// Howard: What? You’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.// Sheldon: Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot.// Raj: Hey, guys.// Howard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Raj: We still on for tomorrow night?// Leonard: Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.// Sheldon: Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.// Howard: Since when do you read social science?// Sheldon: I go to the bathroom like everybody else.// Raj: Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?// Leonard: Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.// Raj: You guys kiss and hold hands.// Leonard: I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.// Raj: Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.// Leonard: What happens if she doesn’t like us?// Raj: Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?// Howard: I don’t want to talk about it.// Bernadette: But he’s going to.// Howard: My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.// Bernadette: Long story short, they have seven HBOs.// Raj: Emily, you know almost everybody here.// Emily: Hi.// Raj: And this is Leonard, this is Penny.// Emily: Oh, it’s so nice to meet you.// Leonard: Nice to finally meet you, too.// Penny: Hi.// Emily: Hello.// Leonard: Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.// Raj: I told you she exists.// Penny: Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist.// Emily: Uh, yeah, I’m a resident at Huntington Hospital.// Sheldon: Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.// Bernadette: You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.// Penny: Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.// Emily: Yeah. I’m sure that’d be fine.// Sheldon: I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?// Emily: Um, okay, I guess.// Amy: I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?// Penny: I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.// Bernadette: Did she say she didn’t like you?// Penny: Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.// Amy: We have led different lives.// Bernadette: You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?// Penny: It’s just this vibe I got.// Bernadette: I’m sure you’re worried about nothing.// Penny: Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.// Bernadette: Really?// Penny: Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.// Bernadette: When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. It’s fine.// Penny: Yeah, I hope you’re right.// Amy: You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?// Penny: Yeah.// Amy: I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.// Scene: Capital Comics.// Sheldon: I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?// Howard: Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.// Leonard: Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.// Howard: Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?// Raj: You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.// Sheldon: Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies.// Leonard: Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?// Howard: All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?// Sheldon: For starters, they shed and bite.// Leonard: Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?// Raj: So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?// Leonard: It’s kind of a dream come true.// Howard: That does sound fun.// Raj: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.// Sheldon: I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.// Leonard: It’s not that bad.// Scene: Emily’s surgery.// Penny: Hey.// Penny: Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.// Emily: Sure.// Penny: Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.// Emily: Thanks. If we could get started. I’m a little busy.// Penny: Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.// Emily: Great.// Penny: So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.// Emily: All right.// Penny: It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.// Emily: Funny.// Penny: Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.// Emily: No, it’s fine.// Penny: Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?// Emily: Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.// Penny: Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?// Emily: Look, it’s nothing. It’s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.// Penny: What? Oh, why would he say that?// Emily: Did it not happen?// Penny: Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.// Emily: Did you kiss?// Emily: Were you naked?// Emily: So, it was a hook-up.// Penny: No. Yeah.// Sheldon: So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?// Leonard: Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.// Howard: You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.// Raj: Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?// Sheldon: Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?// Howard: Toy stores, puppet shows.// Leonard: Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?// Sheldon: Yes.// Leonard: And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?// Raj: We are now.// Penny: You told Emily we hooked up?// Raj: Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.// Penny: Why would you say that?// Raj: We were having a conversation about past lovers.// Penny: We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?// Raj: Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?// Leonard: Why say it?// Penny: Yes.// Raj: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.// Penny: Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.// Raj: Great.// Sheldon: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.// Raj: You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next.// Sheldon: No. You’re crazy about me.// Penny: I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.// Amy: Hmm-hmm.// Penny: Almost everyone has a past.// Bernadette: Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you.// Penny: It’s not.// Bernadette: And I’m sure you can turn it around.// Penny: How? You can’t force someone to like you.// Amy: What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine.// Penny: No, that won’t work.// Amy: You’re right. Cheers.// Bernadette: Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?// Penny: What?// Bernadette: Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute.// Penny: It’s stupid.// Bernadette: Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas.// Amy: I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.// Penny: Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you.// Amy: Shh. Amy’s here now.// Sheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.// Howard: We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.// Sheldon: And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out.// Howard: You say things like that all the time.// Sheldon: Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up.// Leonard: Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?// Howard: Yeah.// Leonard: Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?// Sheldon: I’m sure she did.// Leonard: Why?// Sheldon: Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list.// Leonard: Will you stay out of this?// Sheldon: If only Penny had said that once in a while.// Howard: Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she wants to marry.// Leonard: That’s true.// Howard: Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.// Sheldon: Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.// Leonard: Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.// Sheldon: I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.// Howard: He’s right.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.// Scene: The stairwell.// Leonard: There’s something I wanted to run past you.// Penny: What’s up?// Leonard: Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?// Penny: Why are you asking me?// Leonard: Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.// Penny: Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny: Huh.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Howard: Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.// Bernadette: Nope.// Howard: But you didn’t hear what it was.// Bernadette: I know.// Howard: Oh, come on.// Bernadette: Fine. What is it?// Howard: It’s to help reopen the comic book store.// Howard: Well, hear me out.// Bernadette: Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house.// Howard: I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money.// Bernadette: It just seems like a risky investment.// Howard: I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.// Bernadette: Oh. Howie, I had no idea.// Howard: Well, I don’t like to talk about it.// Bernadette: Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?// Howard: That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.// Sheldon: I’d like your honest opinion on something.// Amy: Of course.// Sheldon: Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.// Amy: I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Perfect. Now, I’m considering investing in Stuart’s comic book store.// Amy: Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?// Sheldon: No.// Amy: Then I think it’s a terrific idea.// Sheldon: Great. Wait till you hear about our van.// Raj: Hey.// Raj: Thanks for inviting us over.// Penny: Oh, thank you for coming.// Emily: Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.// Penny: No, no. No need to apologise.// Raj: Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?// Penny: Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.// Raj: It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.// Penny: Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.// Emily: Mm. I’d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I’d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.// Penny: Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.// Raj: It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Stuart: So, what brings you by?// Howard: Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house.// Stuart: Technically, it’s your mom’s house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.// Howard: I’m always welcome.// Stuart: Mm, just try and call first.// Bernadette: Okay, let’s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.// Stuart: Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.// Howard: What?// Stuart: Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.// Howard: Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more than one bubala.// Stuart: I don’t know who he’s talking to. She’s at Target, buying me shirts.// Raj: I’m so glad we could work this all out.// Penny: Yeah, me, too.// Emily: You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.// Penny: Oh, we would love that.// Penny: Okay, good night, guys.// Emily: All right, night.// Penny: Bye.// Emily and Penny (simultaneously): I hate her.// (simultaneously)// Raj: I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.// Leonard: I know. I was looking forward to it.// Sheldon: It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.// Howard: With comfy seats.// Raj: And snacks.// Sheldon: Well, I guess it was too good to be true.Series 08 Episode 05 – The Focus Attenuation// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.// Leonard: We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?// Howard: Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.// Sheldon: I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.// Leonard: That’s not what happened.// Sheldon: I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death.// Howard: No one wants to hear it.// Sheldon: Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.// Leonard: Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.// Sheldon: Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?// Raj: Easy. Sleeping with Penny.// Howard: Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.// Raj: Tricking Penny into getting engaged.// Howard: And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.// Leonard: I think someone owes me an apology.// Sheldon: Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.// Howard: You admit Amy’s a distraction?// Sheldon: Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?// Leonard: Well, maybe we have lost our focus.// Howard: It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.// Raj: Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.// LeonardLike our own science retreat.// Howard: My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.// Sheldon: I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?// Leonard: Then we’ll go to a hotel.// Sheldon: A hotel? Did you see The Shining?// Raj: We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.// Sheldon: Did you see The Lake House?// Raj: Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.// Leonard: Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.// Sheldon: Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house.// Leonard: You would go to a beach house?// Sheldon: Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Hey.// Leonard: Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.// Penny: Want to go to Vegas this weekend?// Amy: Of course I do.// Penny: Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?// Bernadette: Hell, yeah.// Penny: Yes. I’ll check flights.// Bernadette: I’ll check hotels.// Amy: I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed.// Leonard: They seem okay with it.// Scene: The apartment.// Raj: Hey.// Leonard: Hey.// Howard: Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.// Raj: Why not?// Howard: Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.// Raj: For your information, Emily is working tonight.// Sheldon: Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.// Leonard: Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.// Sheldon: Thinking caps on.// Howard: Here we go.// Raj: Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.// Howard: Oh. I never saw that.// Sheldon: Really?// Raj: Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.// Sheldon: Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.// Raj: Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.// Leonard: Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV.// Sheldon: I’m sorry. Is that a no?// Howard: Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?// Leonard: I, I think I still have it.// Sheldon: I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now.// Leonard: Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.// Howard: Mm, that was mine.// Leonard: Robot prostitute.// Howard: Also mine.// Sheldon: Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?// Howard: There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.// Raj: Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.// Leonard: Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.// Howard: No, it vibrates. Keep going.// Leonard: You know, let’s just come up with something new.// Sheldon: You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.// Raj: Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.// Leonard: How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?// Sheldon: If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application.// Leonard: Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.// Raj: Oh, I have an idea.// Sheldon: I think I have the same one.// Howard: We got to watch Back to the Future II.// Raj: I’ll make the popcorn.// Scene: A Vegas hotel room.// Penny: So, where should we go first?// Amy: Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.// Penny: Nah.// Amy: But they play Barry Manilow.// Penny: No.// Amy: But they’re called Fairly Manilow.// Penny: Oh. Okay.// Amy: Great.// Bernadette: Well, what do you want to do?// Penny: Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.// Amy: What if we don’t want to vomit?// Penny: Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.// Amy: What?// Penny: It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.// Amy: What does that mean?// Penny: It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.// Bernadette: That sucks.// Amy: Can you start in the morning?// Penny: Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.// Bernadette: You sure?// Penny: Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead.// Amy: So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…// Bernadette: We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.// Amy: Okay.// Howard: Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.// Leoanard: This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.// Sheldon: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?// Leonard: What do you mean?// Sheldon: Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?// Leonard: Had will have placed?// Sheldon: That’s my boy.// Leonard: Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.// Sheldon: Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!// Howard: What?// Sheldon: Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…// Leonard: Wait. Is brought right?// Sheldon: Marty and Doc never had have had brought?// Leonard: I don’t know. You did it to me.// Sheldon: Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t.// Raj: He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.// Howard: Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.// Leonard: Guys.// Sheldon: Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?// Raj: Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?// Leonard: Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.// Sheldon: I don’t think it worked.// Scene: A bar in Vegas.// Amy: Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow.// Bernadette: I think after this, I’ll be dead.// Amy: Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying.// Bernadette: I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously.// Amy: It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re looking good.// Bernadette: We are.// Amy: Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’.// Bernadette: Amy.// Amy: Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?// Bernadette: You’re embarrassing me.// Amy: Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine.// Bernadette: What?// Amy: No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.// Scene: Leonard’s laboratory.// Leonard: All right.// Sheldon: Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.// Raj: Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.// Leonard: So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.// Howard: Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.// Sheldon: Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that.// Raj: Go online and look it up.// Shortly afterwards.// Howard: Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.// Raj: That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.// Leonard: I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?// Sheldon: Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?// Howard: Like behavior modification?// Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?// Raj: That cannot be true.// Raj: Hey, it was match point.// Leonard: Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.// Raj: Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.// Howard: We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.// Sheldon: Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.// Leonard: If only we had one.// Sheldon: Oh, I’ll check Amazon.// Scene: The hotel room.// Bernadette: Housekeeping.// Amy: We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.// Bernadette: It was us the whole time.// Amy: Why’d you tell her? It was working.// Bernadette: Was it working?// Penny: Yeah.// Bernadette: Oh, I’m so sorry.// Penny: You guys look like you’re having fun.// Amy: We’re having the best time.// Bernadette: Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.// Penny: That’s a dollar.// Bernadette: Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.// Amy: Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.// Bernadette: We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.// Penny: That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.// Amy: Can you believe this nerd?// Bernadette: Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man’s G-string like a baby kangaroo?// Penny: All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I’ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.// Amy: Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let’s just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I’m gonna quiz you. I’m gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they’re gonna be at the strip club.// Bernadette: Aren’t you gonna chase her?// Penny: To the walk-in closet? Sure.// Scene: Leonard’s lab.// Leonard: Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.// Raj: And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.// Leonard: All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…// Sheldon: Wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?// Leonard: I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not, we’ll take a vote. Oh, and also…// Sheldon: Ow. We didn’t vote!// Leonard: We didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?// Sheldon: You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That’s a tangent and it’s your fault.// Howard: That’s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.// Leonard: Thank you. And now I owe you one.// Sheldon: Ow. That was your fault.// Howard: Hey.// Raj: Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I’m gonna hear it from Jenny.// Leonard: Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn’t working.// Sheldon: I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a common mistake.// Howard: Negative reinforcement is really wrong?// Sheldon: Oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.// Raj: No way. Not Bill Murray.// Bill Murray (on screen): I’m studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.// (on screen)// Raj: Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.// Howard: Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Leonard’s right. We can’t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.// Leonard: Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.// Raj: Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.// Leonard: It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?// Sheldon: But we didn’t see them bust one ghost.// Leonard: So you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?// Sheldon: No.// All: Ghostbusters!// Leonard: It really does hold up.// Scene: The Vegas strip club.// Bernadette: See? Isn’t this better than a hotel room?// Penny: Yep. Shake that thing.// Bernadette: Have you ever seen a body so fine?// Amy: We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that.// Penny: Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it’s bright out. Isn’t it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye.// Bernadette: Would you please close the drapes?Series 08 Episode 06 – The Expedition Approximation// Scene: The apartment.// Bernadette: I like your suit.// Penny: Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.// Howard: How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?// Leonard: She doesn’t flirt with doctors.// Penny: Yeah. It’s all very professional.// Amy: You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?// Penny: Okay, good.// Bernadette: Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?// Sheldon: Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field.// Bernadette: Oh. What’s going on?// Sheldon: I started doing it.// Raj: You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.// Leonard: Yeah, I’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.// Raj: You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.// Penny: Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?// Sheldon: Why not?// Penny: You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.// Sheldon: Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.// Leonard: I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba.// Howard:If they get scared, they’ll have those hats with the lights on them, ’cause down there it’s night-night all the time.// Bernadette: Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.// Leonard: Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.// Sheldon:Are they making fun of us?// Raj: Yup.// Sheldon: I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Leonard: So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.// Penny: I’m sorry, I was thinking about work.// Leonard: Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…// Penny: Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news.// Leonard: Hmm.// Penny: This is for you.// Leonard: Huh. What is this?// Penny: Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.// Leonard: The one I gave you?// Penny: Yeah. And there’s your money back, and now we’re even. How great is that?// Leonard: Uh, yeah.// Penny: What?// Leonard: Nothing.// Penny: Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both.// Leonard: You’re right.// Penny: What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?// Leonard: Doesn’t sound that bad.// Penny: Well, good, because that’s what I did.// Leonard: Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.// Penny: Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.// Leonard: You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.// Penny: Why?// Leonard: The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.// Penny: And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.// Leonard: Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.// Penny: Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.// Leonard: I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.// Penny: Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight.// Leonard: I don’t, either.// Penny: Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?// Leonard: Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.// Scene: Sheldon’s office.// Raj: Hey, Sheldon, you busy?// Sheldon: I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies.// Raj: Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?// Sheldon: Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?// Raj: So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.// Sheldon: Well, I’m from Texas and you’re from India, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.// Raj: It’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.// Sheldon: Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.// Raj: Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.// Sheldon: Yeah? We have to be somewhere.// Raj: Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.// Sheldon: So it’s settled, we’re not doing it.// Raj: Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.// Sheldon: Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.// Raj: Exactly.// Sheldon: Very well.// Raj: So where should we do it?// Sheldon: Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.// Raj: Uh, Sheldon…// Sheldon: Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos.// Leonard: Hey, you got a sec?// Penny: Hi. Sure.// Leonard: I was hoping we could talk about the money again.// Penny: Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.// Leonard: No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.// Penny: Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.// Leonard: Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.// Penny: Mm.// Leonard: Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.// Penny: You know what, that’s great. I love that.// Leonard: Yeah, of course you do, I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.// Penny: You two want to be alone?// Leonard: I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.// Penny: Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I’m trying to be sensitive to that.// Leonard: What?// Penny: Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary.// Leonard: Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.// Penny: Control issues?// Leonard: Maybe.// Penny: Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.// Leonard: Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.// Penny: You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.// Leonard: Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?// Penny: Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.// Scene: The university basement.// Raj: Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.// Amy: Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.// Raj: Did you get in?// Amy: No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.// Sheldon: Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.// Raj: This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.// Sheldon: Plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked.// Raj: Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.// Sheldon: All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?// Amy: Save you first; come back for Raj only if there’s time.// Raj: We’re going to be fine.// Amy: Sheldon, I’m really impressed you’re willing to try this.// Sheldon: Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list.// Raj: I’m sweating already.// Sheldon: Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.// Raj: How hot is it?// Sheldon: Uh, let’s see. 704? No, wait, it’s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees.// Raj: Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.// Sheldon: True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Leonard: Thanks again for having us.// Howard: Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?// Penny: Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.// Bernadette: I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.// Howard: I didn’t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard’s feelings.// Leonard: Well, nailed it.// Howard: So what did you want to know?// Penny: Well, do you guys ever fight over money?// Bernadette: Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.// Howard: You didn’t have to say so much more.// Bernadette: Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.// Howard: I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.// Bernadette: Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?// Howard: For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.// Bernadette: Without asking me?// Howard: There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.// Bernadette: How much, Howie?// Howard: Not a lot.// Bernadette: How much?// Howard: Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.// Bernadette: Was it more or less than falconry school?// Howard: For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.// Leonard: Like I would swing with him.// Scene: The steam tunnel.// Raj: How you feeling?// Sheldon: Good. Little claustrophobic.// Raj: Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.// Sheldon: Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.// Raj: Do you know any mining songs?// Sheldon: Just the hits. (Singing) Where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew.// (Singing)// Rajj: That’s pretty.// Sheldon: Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.// Raj: It’s a little more bleak than I thought.// Sheldon: Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.// Raj: Getting kind of grim.// Sheldon: Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.// Raj: Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?// Sheldon: Who’s he?// Howard: Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?// Bernadette: Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn’t also doing everything else around here.// Howard: Oh, you’re saying I don’t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.// Leonard: She made him a chore chart.// Penny: I see it.// Howard: Do the dishes. There’s a star right there.// Bernadette: That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.// Howard: That pan had to soak and you know it.// Bernadette: Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance.// Howard: It’s not an allowance. It’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.// Leonard: I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.// Raj: So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.// Sheldon: That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?// Raj: But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?// Sheldon: He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.// Amy (shouting): You guys doing okay down there?// (shouting)// Sheldon: I told you to use the walkie-talkie!// Amy (on walkie-talkie): You guys doing okay down there?// (on walkie-talkie)// Sheldon: Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.// Amy: I’m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?// Sheldon: This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.// Amy: Okay, just checking.// Raj: We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.// Sheldon: You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.// Raj: What if we brought them down with us?// Sheldon: We’ll take some Funyuns.// Amy: Anything else?// Sheldon: Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.// Rajj: Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.// Bernadette: Sorry you guys had to see that.// Penny: Oh, don’t apologize.// Leonard: Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.// Bernadette: Money’s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.// Penny: It really bothers him?// Bernadette: Well, sure. There’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him.// Penny: Uh-oh.// Penny: Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.// Leonard: Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what I think love looks like.// Bernadette: I’ll be right back. I’m gonna go check on him.// Penny: Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.// Leonard: Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.// Penny: It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.// Howard (off): Why are you being so bossy?// (off)// Bernadette (off): Why are you being a baby?// Howard (off): I’m not a baby. I’m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where’s my star?// Leonard: Should we go?// Penny: Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.// Raj: Oh, this heat is brutal.// Sheldon: As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.// Rajj: Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.// Sheldon: My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.// Raj: How’s that going?// Sheldon: You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.// Raj: Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.// Sheldon: We’re not stopping.// Raj: You don’t have to bite my head off.// Sheldon: I apologize. I just, I’m plagued by an internal struggle.// Raj: If you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable.// Sheldon: My struggle is emotional.// Raj: Oh. Is it Amy?// Sheldon: It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening.// Raj: Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.// Sheldon: Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?// Raj: The space probe.// Sheldon: Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.// Raj: By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.// // Amy: Sheldon, is everything okay?// Sheldon: It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.// Amy: 11 minutes. That’s longer than I thought.// Raj (off): They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt.// Scene: Penny’s bedroom.// Penny: Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.// Leonard: I’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It’s my first time, too.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Bernadette: I’m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.// Howard: It’s okay.// Bernadette: No, it’s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.// Howard: I want that, too.// Bernadette: Now, let’s talk about your birthday party.// Howard: Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.// Bernadette: Oh.// Amy: Do you really need me to transcribe this?// Sheldon: You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle. (Voice on recorder) Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.// (Voice on recorder)// Raj: You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.// Sheldon: His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.Series 08 Episode 07 – The Misinterpretation Agitation// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: So, what are you working on these days?// Amy: I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.// Bernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?// Penny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.// Bermadette: Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.// Penny: Okay, if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.// Bernadette: He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?// Amy: I think it’s awful.// Penny: Why would you say that?// Amy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?// Penny: I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.// Bernadette: Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?// Amy: I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.// Penny: Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.// Amy: Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.// Bernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad.// Penny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The building foyer.// Man with Flowers: Thank you.// Sheldon: No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know.// Man: I’m not a delivery man, I’m a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.// Sheldon: That’s humorous.// Man: All right.// Sheldon: Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.// Sheldon: Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.// Man: All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.// Sheldon: Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.// Man: I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.// Sheldon: Making the extra effort. Good for you.// Leonard: Great timing, food just got here.// Sheldon: Ooh, Siam Palace?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?// Sheldon: Uh, extra peanut sauce?// Leonard: No, but you can have mine.// Sheldon: Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.// Leonard: What? Why didn’t you say that first?// Sheldon: Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.// Leonard: Can I help you?// Man: Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?// Leonard: May I ask why?// Man: Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.// Leonard: Okay, um, look, I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you.// Man: Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two…// Leonard: I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.// Man: Really? I’ve never seen her wear an engagement ring.// Raj: Really?// Man: So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?// Leonard: I think so.// Man: When will I learn? It’s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.// Leonard: Excuse me?// Man: Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You’re a, you’re a lucky man.// Leonard: Thank you. Sorry.// Man: Oh, uh, you probably don’t want her to see this. It’s unnecessarily graphic.// Sheldon: Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.// Leonard: He tried to score with Penny.// Sheldon: So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us.// Scene: A bar.// Amy: So, how was work today?// Bernadette: It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.// Amy: What happened?// Bernadette: I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.// Amy: Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.// Bernadette: I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here.// Amy: Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled.// Bernadette: What? How?// Amy: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.// Bernadette: Amy, what did you say?// Amy: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.// Bernadette: Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.// Amy: Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.// Bernadette: No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.// Amy: But it was bad publicity.// Bernadette: That’s for me to decide, not you.// Amy: I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.// Bernadette: And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line.// Amy: You have a nice night.// Bernadette: Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.// Man: Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.// Raj: Oh, cool.// Howard: How’d you get that?// Man: Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.// Sehldon: Wait a minute. You’ve snipped Gene Roddenberry’s vas deferens?// Man: Yes.// Howard: Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.// Man: I don’t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I’m kind of the doctor to the stars’ urinary tracts.// All: Wow.// Man: Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron’s kidney stone?// All: Ooh.// Man: He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.// Leonard: That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?// Man: Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn’t really get serious until William Shatner’s bladder infection.// Sheldon: What’d you get? What’d you get?// Man: Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it’s pretty cool.// Raj: I would love to see your collection.// Man: Anytime. Uh, I’ve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.// Howard: We know.// Raj: Preach.// Man: Can I ask you a personal question?// Leonard: Sure.// Man: Um, I mean, you’re a guy like me, so how’d you get a girl like Penny?// Leonard: Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.// Sheldon: Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.// Leonard: I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.// Howard: A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.// Leonard: Can we please change the subject?// Penny: Hi.// Raj: Well, that didn’t go your way.// Penny: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?// Dr Lorvis: Uh, well, actually I came to see you.// Penny: Really? Why?// Leonard: Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.// Sheldon: Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.// Penny: Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.// Dr Lorvis: You touched my arm for two Mississippis.// Penny: Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.// Leonard: Can we talk in private?// Penny: Please, yes.// Leonard: I’ll be right back.// Sheldon: So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?// Leonard: So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?// Penny: What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.// Leonard: Why?// Penny: Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?// Leonard: Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.// Penny: You were okay with that?// Leonard: No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.// Penny: Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?// Leonard: A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy.// Penny: Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.// Leonard: Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?// Penny: I can’t do it, he’s my best client.// Leonard: All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.// Raj: Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?// Leonard: Yeah, sure. You owe me.// Scene: Dr Lorvis’ basement.// Leonard: Oh, my God.// Sheldon: Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.// Dr Lorvis: Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.// Howard: Oh, come on. It’s a replica.// Dr Lorvis: Original.// Howard: Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.// Raj: The gun from Hellboy?// Dr Lorvis: Yup.// Raj: How did you get it?// Dr Lorvis: Bought it at auction.// Raj: Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.// Woman’s voice (off): Oliver, I’m going to play bingo.// (off)// Dr Lorvis: Okay, Mother. Have fun.// Howard: Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?// Raj: Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond.// Leonard: Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.// Sheldon: Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?// Leonard: No, because I liked it.// Sheldon: Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.// Dr Lorvis: So, I’ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.// Sheldon: Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.// Dr Lorvis: So, you think she’ll be single soon?// Sheldon: Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased.// Dr Lorvis: Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.// Sheldon: Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.// Scene: The lobby.// Dr Lorvis: Oh, could you hold the door?// Amy: Nice flowers.// Dr Lorvis: Thank you. They’re for a girl. Uh, I’m being implacable and relentless.// Amy: Isn’t she lucky?// Dr Lorvis: She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.// Amy: What’s that?// Dr Lorvis: Unconditional love.// Amy: I guess that’s all anybody wants.// Dr Lorvis: I guess so.// Amy: Well, I hope you get it.// Dr Lorvis: One Mississippi, two Mississippi.// Leonard: Next game, let’s switch helmets.// Sheldon: No, I’d look silly in that helmet.// Scene: The stairwell.// Amy: I can’t take these.// Dr Lorvis: Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.// Amy: But what about the other girl?// Dr Lorvis: Oh, right. I’ll tell her we should just be friends.// Penny: Dr. Lorvis?// Dr Lorvis: Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?// Raj: You think he bites?// Howard: Stick your head in there and find out.// Raj: You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.// Leonard: I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.// Raj: Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.// Howard: It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.// Raj: Okay, now you’re messing with me.// Leonard: Uh, guys, we’re locked in here.// Sheldon: Oh, this day just keeps getting better.// Penny: So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?// Dr Lorvis: Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.// Amy: We all have a past.// Penny: Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy.// Dr Lorvis: You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.// Penny: Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you.// Dr Lorvis: Well, that’s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.// Penny (on phone): Hey, Leonard. Guess who’s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?// (on phone)// Dr Lorvis: Well, they’re, they’re not locked in. The door just sticks.// Penny: Okay, so how do they unstick it?// Dr Lorvis: They’d need the key.// Penny: Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.// Dr Lorvis: Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.// Penny: Move it.// Scene: The foyer.// Bernadette: Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry.// Amy: That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.// Bernadette: What?// Dr Lorvis: She seems nice. Who’s she?// Penny: Just walk.// Sheldon: You can do this.// Raj: One ladder left.// Leonard: Oh-hom yeah.// Howard: Yes.// Leonard: Next level.// Penny: Leonard, are you okay?// Leonard: Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.// Amy: Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?// Dr Lorvis: Yes. I’m very sorry for locking you in my home.// Howard: Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.// Leonard: Got it.// Penny: Okay, Leonard, let’s go.// Leonard: Just hang on.// Dr Lorvis: Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire’s prostate sonogram?// Amy: Sure.// Penny: Yeah.// Dr Lorvis: Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.Series 08 Episode 08 – The Prom Equivalency// Scene: The cafeteria.// Leonard: Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.// Howard: Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld.// Leonard: I know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.// Howard: That’s fine. I don’t care.// Rajj: It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?// Howard: They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.// Raj: And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.// Howard: Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating.// Raj: Like who?// Howard: Like you and your dog.// Leonard: Don’t rule out the dating.// Howard: Fine, it bothers me. You happy?// Sheldon: You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.// Howard: How is this helpful?// Sheldon: All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.// Leonard: But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.// Sheldon: True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Penny’s Apartment.// Amy: Hi.// Penny: Hey.// Bernadette: We brought snacks for movie night.// Penny: Oh, great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.// Bernadette: Right here.// Penny: Ah, You guys are the best.// Amy: What’s with the clothes?// Penny: Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.// Amy: I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?// Penny: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.// Bernadette: Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.// Penny: What kind of teenager did you think I was?// Bernadette: Slutty.// Amy: Easy.// Penny: The word is popular.// Bernadette: How was your prom? Did you go?// Amy: No, but I was on clean-up crew.// Penny: Aw, that’s sad.// Amy: No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.// Bernadette: My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.// Amy: Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.// Penny: Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.// Bernadette: Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.// Penny: No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.// Amy: My date would’ve had to clean that up.// Bernadette: Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.// Amy: Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.// Bernadette: Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.// Penny: Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.// Amy: You went to seven proms?// Penny: Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.// Scene: The apartment.// Howard: Hey.// Raj: Hey.// Leonard: Hey, where’s Bernadette?// Howard: She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.// Raj: Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.// Howard: Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.// Raj: Did you go to your prom?// Sheldon: No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…// Penny: Okay, okay.// Shldon: …of AP Calculus.// Raj: How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?// Leonard: Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?// Penny: Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?// Leonard: Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.// Penny: Ugh, thanks a lot.// Leonard: What?// Penny: Well, now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch.// Raj: That sounds like a yes.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Bernadette: Ooh, every single person RSVP’d yes. This is so exciting. Isn’t this exciting?// Howard: Yep.// Bernadette: Look, even Stuart’s bringing a date. I wonder who it is.// Howard: You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?// Bernadette: Because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can’t he take your mom? You took her to your prom.// Howard: I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone.// Bernadette: I saw a picture of you two dancing together.// Howard: What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore.// Stuart (on phone): Hello.// (on phone)// Howard: Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It’s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party I’m going to? What the hell?// Stuart: I’m not bringing your mother, I have a date.// Howard: Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?// Stuart: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There’s nothing weird going on with me and your mother.// Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, your bath is getting cold!// (off)// Stuart: I got to go, bye.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?

(Knock, knock, knock) Penny?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Penny: You knocked more than usual.// Sheldon: Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank.// Penny: Okay, what’s up?// Sheldon: I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.// Penny: Great, how?// Sheldon: We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.// Penny: Okay, just one question. What?// Sheldon: My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.// Penny: Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?// Sheldon: There are post-prom mating rituals?// Penny: Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.// Sheldon: Well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then I’m open to it.// Penny: You’re kidding.// Sheldon: I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on.// Leonard: You know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.// Sheldon: Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.// Leonard: Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.// Sheldon: His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.// Leonard: There, perfect.// Sheldon: What, are you sure? It’s my first prom, I want to do it correctly.// Leonard: I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.// Sheldon: I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.// Leonard: Was that a flask?// Sheldon: Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.// Leonard: You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?// Sheldon: Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.// Leonard: If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?// Sheldon: Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook.// Leonard: And while you’re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to.// Sheldon: Why would you say that?// Leonard: You know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.// Sheldon: Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?// Leonard: Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones.// Leonard: Wow, you look amazing.// Penny: Thank you, so do you.// Amy: Sheldon, you look so handsome.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Penny: Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.// Amy: What’s that?// Leonard: Oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing.// Sheldon: Excuse me.// Amy: Where are you going?// Sheldon: I can’t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.// Leonard: He’s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.// Scene: A limo.// Raj: Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close.// Bernadette: That’s a neat tattoo.// Emily: Oh, thanks, it’s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.// Bernadette: Aw, that movie’s so cute.// Howard: Do you like her because you both have red hair?// Emily: Uh, a little, but more that she’s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.// Bernadette: I like Cinderella.// Emily: Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?// Bernadette: I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.// Raj: Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.// Emily: Oh, she’s cute.// Howard: Oh, my God.// Bernadette: What?// Howard: That’s Jeanie.// Bernadette: That’s Jeanie?// Emily: Who’s Jeanie?// Howard: Don’t say it.// Raj: That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.// Howard: She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don’t say it.// Emily: No, it’s okay. He told me that story a long time ago.// Howard: Raj.// Raj: It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?// Scene: The rooftop.// Penny: Oh, it’s beautiful.// Leonard: Oh, the girls really did a nice job.// Penny: Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.// Leonard: What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.// Penny: Well, who’d you go with?// Leonard: I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.// Penny: Aw.// Leonard: Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…// Penny: Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance.// Leonard: No, you wouldn’t have.// Penny: Well, you don’t know that.// Leonard: It was before my growth spurt.// Penny: What, that already happened?// Leonard: Very funny.// Penny: Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either.// Leonard: I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Amy: Sheldon, can I come in?// Sheldon: I don’t think that’s a good idea.// Amy: Why not?// Sheldon: According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.// Amy: You’re making me worry. What’s going on?// Sheldon: What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.// Amy: What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?// Sheldon: It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.// Sceme: The limo.// Stuart: So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys’. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.// Rajj: Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?// Howard: So, my mother’s okay with this?// Jeannie: Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?// Howard: ‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.// Jeannie: Weirder than what you and I did in my dad’s Corolla?// Raj: This is so messed up.// Emily: I know, I’m having the best time.// Howard: Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?// Jeannie: It was a long time ago, Howard.// Stuart: And you’re only second cousins, who cares?// Bernadette: So, you knew and you brought her anyway?// Stuart: Oh, so she’s good enough for Howard, but not for me?// Howard: Yeah.// Bernadette: Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.// Penny: Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.// Leonard: There’s no music.// Penny: I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.// Leonard: My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.// Penny: Thank you for wearing your heels.// Leonard: Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.// Penny: Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?// Leonard: I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.// Penny: I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.// Scene: The limo.// Bernadette: Howie, get off of him.// Howard: Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedrooom.// Amy: Sheldon, this is silly. I’m not missing another prom. I’m going upstairs now. Good-bye.// Sheldon: I really did think you looked pretty.// Amy: You did?// Sheldon: Yes. So much so that I started to panic.// Amy: Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together.// Sheldon: Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?// Amy: I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.// Sheldon: Thank you for understanding.// Amy: Of course I understand. Sheldon, there’s something else I’ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. I know you’re not ready, and I don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…// Sheldon: I love you, too.// Amy: You said it.// Sheldon: There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.// Amy: Okay.// Sheldon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room.// Raj: Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…// Iskip)// Stuart: Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. (On phone) Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I’m here with Jeanie. Okay, but we’re just friends. It’s, yeah. I got to go.// (On phone)Series 08 Episode 09 – The Septum Deviation// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: This is an easy one. You love this guy.// Sheldon: Me.// Amy: Come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius.// Sheldon: Still think it’s me.// Amy: It’s not you. Now think, there’s a car named after him.// Sheldon: Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me.// Amy: How about this, he’s a poor man’s Sheldon Cooper.// Sheldon: Oh, Tesla.// Penny: Hi.// Amy: Hello.// Sheldon: Hey, how did it go?// Leonard: Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.// Penny: Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.// Amy: Did they figure out what’s wrong?// Leonard: Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week.// Sheldon: Why would you have surgery?// Leonard: Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.// Penny: Yeah, back off, he’s all mine.// Sheldon: But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?// Amy: Sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, I’ve heard you complain about his snoring.// Sheldon: Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.// Leonard: Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. End of story.// Sheldon: Very well. I’m done talking about it.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: I believe it was your turn in the game.// Amy: Okay.// Sheldon: Let’s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.// Leonard: I think you could give a better clue.// Sheldon: I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.// Leonard: Okay, why?// Sheldon: I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it.// Leonard: If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?// Sheldon: Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?// Leonard: What’s your problem?// Sheldon: If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.// Leonard: It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.// Sheldon: I have to be honest with you Leonard, I’m truly worried.// Leonard: I told you, there’s nothing to worry about.// Sheldon: Well, I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.// Leonard: Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?// Sheldon: I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Raj: Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them.// Howard: Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?// Bernadette: Not anymore.// Raj: Anyway, any ideas on a gift?// Bernadette: Well, what are some of the things they like?// Raj: They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.// Bernadette: He said that to her?// Raj: Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.// Bernadette: They’re yours in the divorce.// Leonard: Hey. What’re you working on?// Sheldon: Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?// Leonard: Yeah?// Sheldon: Well, I’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.// Leonard: Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.// Sheldon: Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?// Leonard: I’m not allergic to latex.// Sheldon: Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?// Leonard: For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair net.// Sheldon: Fine. What about epilepsy?// Leonard: I don’t have epilepsy, either.// Sheldon: You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.// Leonard: Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?// Sheldon: I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.// Leonard: Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I’m not going to die.// Sheldon: You don’t know that.// Leonard: Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike.// Sheldon: You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.// Leonard: If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?// Sheldon: I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way.// Leonard: Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll think about it.// Sheldon: Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj (on phone): Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye.// (on phone):// Howard: So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.// Raj: Dude, my parents just split up.// Howard: What?// Raj: Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.// Howard: Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here.// Raj: No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.// Howard: You sure you’re okay?// Raj: I’m okay.// Howard: You don’t look okay.// Raj: How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.// Scene: A waiting room.// Leonard: The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.// Penny: Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?// Leonard: He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Sheldon: 18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it.// Amy: Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work.// Sheldon: Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.// Amy: It’s nice they’re getting exercise.// Sheldon: Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.// Amy: I’m sure he brought it.// Sheldon: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.// Amy: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it.// Sheldon: You’re acting odd. Why?// Amy: I’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.// Sheldon: Tell me the truth.// Amy: Twenty eight.// Sheldon: Come on.// Amy: Fifty six.// Sheldon: Amy. What’s going on?// Amy: All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now.// Sheldon: I see. Take me to Leonard.// Amy: Just go to work, he’ll be fine.// Sheldon: Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, I’m going there anyway.// Amy: Fine. It’s sweet that you care about him so much.// Sheldon: I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so.// Scene: The waiting room.// Sheldon: Hello.// Penny: We had a really nice swim.// Sheldon: Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.// Penny: ‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?// Sheldon: That’s for the fire marshal to determine.// Penny: You had to tell him?// Amy: He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.// Sheldon: Is he okay?// Penny: He’s still in surgery.// Sheldon: Very well.// Penny: He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.// Amy: Come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery.// Sheldon: That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?// Penny: I think she meant something a little happier.// Sheldon: I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.// Scene: Raj’s office.// Howard: Knock, knock.// Bernadette: Hi.// Raj: Hey. What brings you by?// Bernadette: Oh, muffin much.// Howard: Told you, not funny.// Bernadette: He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.// Raj: I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.// Howard: So, how you doing?// Raj: Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.// Bernadette: Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.// Howard: Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.// Bernadette: Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.// Howard: As you can see, we’re here to cheer you up.// Bernadette: Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?// Raj: I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.// Bernadette: It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?// Penny: Oh, it’s nice you got him that.// Sheldon: Oh, this isn’t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.// Amy: Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.// Sheldon: You know those confounded things make me dizzy.// Amy: Who told you to keep going around?// Sheldon: There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.// Penny: Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time.// Amy: Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself.// Sheldon: It was like a grapefruit.// Amy: And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.// Sheldon: Well, I’m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.// Penny: Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.// Sheldon: The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.// Penny: Really? You won’t even say A?// Sheldon: You bet your sweet B I won’t.// Penny: Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.// Sheldon: And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.// Penny: Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.// Sheldon: A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don’t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he’s okay.// Amy: Sheldon, you can’t go back there.// Sheldon: Try and stop me.// Amy: Are you okay?// Sheldon: Why didn’t you stop me?// Bernadette: Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.// Howard: What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s parents probably split up because of Raj.// Bernadette: What?// Howard: They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on.// Bernadette: I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don’t want that to happen to us.// Howard: How can I convince you it won’t?// Bernadette: Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?// Howard: I’m not answering that. It’s a trap.// Bernadette: So there are things you don’t like.// Howard: And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m gonna chew my leg off.// Bernadette: Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won’t get mad.// Howard: Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful.// Bernadette: Oh. Howie, be serious.// Howard: Okay, okay. I really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel.// Bernadette: Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.// Howard: I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…// Bernadette: Who were you in couples therapy with?// Howard: Not important.// Bernadette: Was it your mom?// Bernadette: It was your mom.// Howard: Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.// Bernadette: Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that.// Howard: All right.// Bernadette: Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.// Howard: Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and independent.// Bernadette: And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.// Howard: I love that I’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that.// Bernadette: Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that.// Howard: See, I am. Isn’t this great?// Penny: Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.// Sheldon: You know this is all your fault.// Leonard: How is it my fault?// Sheldon: I told you not to get the surgery.// Leonard: Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn’t even want you there.// Sheldon: Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you.// Amy: Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out.// Penny: Yeah, ’cause you sound really funny.// Leonard: Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.// Sheldon: Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out.// Leonard: I never thought I’d say these words, but come on, nose spider.// Penny: Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him.// Amy: Sheldon will move out eventually.// Penny: Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.// Sheldon: I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.// Leonard: You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.// Sheldon: Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.// Bernadette: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair.// Howard: I love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.// Bernadette: I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.// Howard: And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It’s like washing myself with a hamster.// Raj: Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.// Bernadette: Oh, how is she?// Raj: Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you guys?// Howard: We’re just saying all the things we love about each other.// Raj: Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.// Leonard: Oh, what’d you get?// Sheldon: Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I was going to put you in.// Penny: Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back.// Sheldon: I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”// Leonard: That’s funny. Boy, I’m gonna miss these painkillers.// Penny: Hey, why did you get two? I’m with stupid.// Sheldon: Oh, that one’s mine.Series 08 Episode 10 – The Champagne Reflection// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Hello. I’m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?// Amy: I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?// Sheldon: But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.// Amy: And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.// Sheldon: So as they say, all good things must come to an end.// Amy: After only 232 episodes.// Sheldon: 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.// Amy: You said you weren’t gonna bring that up.// Sheldon: And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?// Amy: That was a good one.// Sheldon: It was so good.// Credits sequence.// Scene: An office at the university.// Raj: You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross.// Howard: Doesn’t Professor Abbott’s family want any of this stuff?// Leonard: I don’t think he had a family.// Raj: That’s rough.// Leonard: I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box.// Howard: Makes you think. Oh, well.// Leonard: Hey. Hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important.// Howard: I did. It’s all outdated or disproved.// Raj: I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.// Howard: Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.// Leonard: It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.// Howard: Don’t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.// Leonard: That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.// Howard: That’s intense.// Raj: Poor Roger Abbott.// Howard: Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.// Raj: Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he’s dead, but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.// Scene: A hotel conference room.// Dan: Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.// Penny: Oh, Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine.// Dan: Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.// Penny: Aw.// Dan: Yes. Why don’t you come over to my table.// Penny: I’ll be right there. Bernadette’s just parking the car.// Dan: Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.// Penny: Come on. She’s not that bad.// Dan: Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.// Penny: I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…// Bernadette: Hey, what are you talking about?// Penny: Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn’t that right? Dan?// Sheldon: Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.// Amy: And, yes, even shed a tear or two.// Sheldon: Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.// Amy: How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?// Sheldon: How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.// Highlight 1// Sheldon: Crikey, what flag do we have today?// Amy: Australia, mate.// Highlight 2// Sheldon: And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.// Kripke: Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.// Highlight 3// Amy: Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?// Sheldon: I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.// Amy: Then who did sew it, hmm?// Sheldon: Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.// Highlight 4// Sheldon: Fancy a dip, my dear?// Amy: I do.// Sheldon: Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.// Amy: Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.// Sheldon: No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.// Highlight 5// Kripke: Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.// Scene: The office.// Raj: When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?// Howard: Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?// Raj: Wrong, smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.// Leonard: Look at these notebooks. They’re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.// Howard: Mmm. It’s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.// Leonard: Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?// Raj: Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.// Leonard: This has to mean something.// Howard: Well, there’s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check.// Leonard: Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.// Howard: Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.// Leonard: Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.// Howard: Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.// Raj: Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.// Howard: Oh, let’s do that.// Leonard: Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?// Howard: Yeah, I’m not even sure if it’s the right word.// Scene: The conference room.// Penny: So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?// Dan: Seven.// Bernadette: Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.// Penny: I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.// Bernadette: Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.”// Dan: I need another drink.// Bernadette: What’s his problem?// Penny: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.// Bernadette: Well, I didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.// Penny: Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.// Bernadette: What? I’m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.// Penny: Yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean.// Bernadette: Oh, yeah? You one of those people?// Penny: No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.// Amy: Action.// Sheldon: Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.// LeVar Burton: Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.// Sheldon: You do this, I delete your contact information.// LeVar: While?// Sheldon: While you watch me do it.// LeVar: Great. Happy to be back.// Sheldon: Well, since you’re here, I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? (On recording) Hi. My name is George.// (On recording)// LeVar: Oh, hell, no.// Sheldon: You heard him, Leonard. No, it’s not racist.// Scene: An apartment building.// Howard: Are we sure this is the place?// Raj: The doorman said this is the right building.// Leonard: I think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman. (Knocks)// (Knocks)// Man (off): Who is it?// (off)// Leonard: Uh, I’ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?// Prof Sharpe: Hold on. Can I help you?// Leonard: Hi. We’re from the university. We’re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.// Howard: We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.// Leonard: Any chance you know what it is?// Prof Sharpe: Yes, he was always working on this.// Raj: I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.// Prof Sharpe: It’s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That’s his food diary.// Leonard: Really?// Prof Sharpe: Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.// Raj: Does it work?// Howard: Seriously?// Raj: Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know.// Prof Sharpe: Sorry it’s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn’t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.// Leonard: So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?// Prof Sharpe: To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.// Raj: You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.// Raj: Well, you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm.// Bernadette: I’m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.// Penny: No. That’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.// Bernadette: I did say that, didn’t I?// Penny: Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.// Bernadette: Where? To Babies R Us?// Penny: You’re doing it again.// Bernadette: Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.// Penny: Oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.// Bernadette: I think I’d rather go.// Penny: No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.// Bernadette: Thank you.// Penny: Even though your dress is ugly.// Scene:The apartment.// Sheldon: Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I’d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.// Amy: Take that, glass ceiling.// Sheldon: And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn’t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I’m giving it up. Before I sign off, I’d, uh, I’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It’s good for times like this. Good night.// Amy: Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.// Sheldon: If you didn’t press record…// Amy: I pressed it.// Leonard: Well, that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott.// Raj: And we still don’t know who framed him.// Leonard: I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.// Howard: I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.// Leonard: That’s a nice way of looking at it.// Howard: Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I’m covered.// Leonard: You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let’s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.// Howard: I love that.// Raj: Yeah, me, too.// Leonard: Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face.// Raj: Oh, well, that’s the best part.// Howard: Oh, yeah.// Bernadette: Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?// Dan: Sure, go ahead.// Bernadette: Just want you to know I didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson.// Dan: No, it’s okay.// Bernadette: No, it’s not. Penny told me that everyone’s scared of me.// Dan: What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?// Penny: What?// Bernadette: No, she’s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I’m gonna be much more sensitive. I don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me.// Dan: Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I’ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.// Bernadette: No problem. When does that start?// Dan: Five months ago.// Bernadette: What?// Dan: Yeah.// Bernadette: Who’s been paying for my coffee?// Dan: All of us.// Penny: Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.// Bernadette: What else don’t I know about?// Penny: Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?// Bernadette: Yeah?// Penny: That was supposed to be for the whole floor.// Bernadette: You’re kidding.// Dan: No, no. It’s okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she’s back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.// Bernadette: I feel so bad.// Penny: Well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her Wheelchair Kathy.// Bernadette: Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I’m just a monster.// Dan: But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.// Bernadette: No, I’m the worst. I’m a terrible person.// Dan: Come on, don’t cry. It’s okay.// Bernadette: It’s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?// Penny: Because this company needs you.// Dan: It’s fine. We don’t mind paying for the coffee.// Bernadette: I can’t let you do that.// Dan: Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.// Bernadette: I guess that would be all right.// Penny: See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want.// Bernadette: You’re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: How come you’re up so late?// Sheldon: I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.// Leonard: Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.// Sheldon: It’s not the same thing. I don’t think you know how I feel at all.// Leonard: Sad?// Sheldon: Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.// Leonard: Yeah. What did they say?// Sheldon: Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.// Leonard: Congratulations.// Sheldon: Let’s celebrate.// Leonard: Sheldon, that wasn’t for you.// Sheldon: Oh, no, I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.// Scene: LeVar Burton’s house.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton?// (Knock, knock, knock)// LeVar: Ugh. What are you doing here?// Sheldon: You told me not to call, and I didn’t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.// LeVar: Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don’t know why I didn’t get a gate.// Sheldon: You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk// about German flags. How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?Series 08 Episode 11 – The Clean Room Infiltration// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Hey, how are things going with your parents?// Raj; Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.// Sheldon: You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.// Penny: You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon.// Amy: Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?// Howard: Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.// Sheldon: Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire.// Raj: Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.// Amy: If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.// Raj: That would be nice.// Amy: I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.// Sheldon: Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.// Amy: You’re going.// Sheldon: Why do you hate me?// Amy: I don’t hate you. I love you.// Sheldon: Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.// Raj: Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.// Bernadette: I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.// Howard: I agree.// Leonard: Why not?// Penny: Me, too.// Raj: You guys suck.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The University clean room.// Leonard: You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen.// Howard: We should get going to Amy’s.// Leonard: Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.// Howard: I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty.// Leonard: Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.// Howard: How the hell did a pigeon get in here?// Leonard: You shut the loading doors, right?// Howard: I thought you did.// Leonard: Do you know what a disaster this is?// Howard: You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?// Leonard: What do we do? Should we call someone?// Howard: And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.// Leonard: Okay, how do we catch it?// Howard: Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it.// Leonard: It’s not a moth.// Howard: Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.// Leonard: Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?// Howard: Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Penny: So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?// Dr Koothrappali: Twenty hours.// Penny: Oh, that’s rough.// Dr Koothrappali: Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don’t pray for the plane to crash?// Raj: Can we please talk about anything else?// Dr Koothrappali: Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?// Penny: Oh, great. Everything’s good.// Dr Koothrappali: I see you got engaged.// Penny: Yes, we did.// Dr Koothrappali: Let me tell you a story.// Raj: Dad.// Dr Koothrappali: Sorry. I’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other.// Raj (on phone): Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.// (on phone)// Amy: What’s going on?// Raj: There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.// Dr Koothrappali: You want me to come?// Raj: Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.// Dr Koothrappali: Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.// Penny: You’re just gonna leave him here?// Dr Koothrappali: Relax, he says.// Raj: Yup. Bye.// Scene: Bernadette’s car.// Bernadette (singing): Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.// (singing)// Sheldon: Yeah, I appreciate the ride.// Bernadette (singing): Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?// Sheldon: Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.// Bernadette: Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.// Sheldon: My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.// Bernadette: Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?// Sheldon: Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts.// Bernadette: Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.// Sheldon: Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.// Bernadette: She’s just excited about the holidays.// Sheldon: Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson.// Bernadette: How?// Sheldon: Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good.// Bernadette: What?// Sheldon: I’m going to buy her a present.// Bernadette: Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.// Sheldon: With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible.// Bernadette: Then you’re both sad?// Sheldon: Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.// Bernadette: So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?// Sheldon: That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.// Scene: The clean room.// Howard: Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.// Leonard: A Slim Jim?// Howard: It’s all I could find. It’ll work.// Leonard: Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.// Howard: Okay, well, what’s your plan?// Leonard: I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.// Howard: And admit that we contaminated the clean room?// Leonard: No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.// Howard: Why do you keep assuming it was me?// Leonard: Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.// Howard: Like when?// Leonard: What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?// Howard: Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.// Leonard: Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.// Howard: Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?// Leonard: I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.// Raj: Hey, what’s going on?// Leonard: Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.// Raj: Should have put it in the bag first.// Penny: So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?// Dr Koothrappali: It’s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?// Penny: No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?// Amy: Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.// Penny: Like what?// Amy: Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.// Penny: Sorry. She’s taken, too.// Howard: You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.// Leonard: And you found somebody you could push around?// Raj: Hey.// Howard: Stay out of this.// Raj: Okay.// Howard: You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me.// Raj: Actually.// Howard: I said, stay out of it.// Leonard: No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.// Raj: All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard.// Howard: Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out.// Raj: No, you’re the one who let him in.// Howard: How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?// Raj: Come on.// Scene: A shopping mall.// Bernadette: What about that sweater?// Sheldon: No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect.// Bernadette: I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.// Sheldon: Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along.// Bernadette: Wow, you really do love her.// Sheldon: I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.// Amy: You won.// Penny: Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?// Dr Koothrappali: You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.// Penny: Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.// Dr Koothrappali: Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.// Penny: Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.// Scene: Santa’s grotto.// Santa: All right, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?// Sheldon: Correct.// Santa: Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.// Sheldon: There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.// Photographer: Smile.// Santa: Ho, ho. ho.// Leonard: Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.// Howard: Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?// Leonard: Do you want the fire extinguisher?// Howard: Yeah, I do.// Leonard: Great. Here you go.// Howard: Okay. One, two, three.// Raj: Uh, you have to take the pin out.// Leonard: You miss the blanket now, don’t you?// Howard: On three. One, two, three.// Raj: What did you do?// Howard: It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.// Leonard: Relax, it wasn’t your fault.// Howard: Uh, maybe it’s just stunned.// Raj: Dude, it’s not breathing.// Howard: Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.// Raj: What do you mean, not again?// Howard: When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.// Leonard: Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.// Howard: Great. Do it.// Leonard: I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.// Raj: I’ll do it.// Howard: No. I need to do it. This is on me.// Leonard: Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.// Raj: Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.// Leonard: Anything?// Howard: I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.// Leonard: Wait, wait, his wing moved.// Howard: Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive.// Raj: It’s a Christmas miracle.// Howard: I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain.// Raj: Someone should really close that loading door.// Scene: The same, later.// Raj: Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.// Howard: You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.// Leonard: No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.// Raj: Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.// Leonard (on phone): Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?// Penny: It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?// Leonard: I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.// Penny: Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?// Leonard: No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.// Penny: So erase them and walk out.// Leonard: I can’t do that.// Howard: Can’t do what?// Leonard: She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.// Howard: We can’t do that.// Leonard: Yeah.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Leonard, Howard and Raj (singing): Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.// Raj: Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.// Sheldon: If you like raisins.// Amy: Thank you. And it’s figs.// Sheldon: Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.// Bernadette: You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.// Howard: It smelled too much like blue jay.// Dr Koothrappali: Can I help you clean up?// Amy: Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good.// Sheldon: Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?// Penny: Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any.// Leonard: I thought you hate giving gifts.// Sheldon: Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.// Amy: You got me something?// Sheldon: Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.// Amy: Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.// Sheldon: Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?// Amy: No, I love it.// Sheldon: Oh, really? Well, how about now? (On recording) Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. (Not on recording) And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.// (On recording)// (Not on recording)// Amy: Actually, I did get you something.// Sheldon: But what about our agreement?// Amy: Well, you got me something. Here.// Sheldon: Cookies?// Amy: They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.// Sheldon: They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.// Amy: Merry Christmas, Sheldon.// Sheldon: I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.// Amy: Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.// Penny: Of course it is.// Amy: One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.// Raj: If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy.Series 08 Episode 12 – The Space Probe Disintegration// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: What colour would you like to be?// Leonard: Well, I’d like to be green, but you know you always take it.// Sheldon: That’s not true. Any colour’s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.// Leonard: Blue and yellow make green.// Sheldon: Well, then it’s settled.// Penny: Hi. Ready to go?// Sheldon: Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.// Amy: Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.// Sheldon: Oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.// Penny: Sweetie, you really thought I’d want to do this?// Leonard: No.// Penny: Well, did you tell him that?// Leonard: Yes.// Penny: Did you say it out loud with words?// Penny: I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.// Amy: I will literally race you to the car.// Leonard: No, no, no, come on, don’t leave. Just try it.// Penny: No. We’re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted.// Sheldon: You want to be green?// Leonard: You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into.// Penny: Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary.// Amy: Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I’m banished to the kitchen.// Penny: Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do.// Leonard: You got it, you girls are in charge.// Penny: Thank you.// Amy: Sheldon?// Sheldon: Fine. Now that we’re not playing, you can be green.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: And since you’re green this time, I can be it next time.// Penny: All right, let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.// Amy: I actually can’t. My hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.// Penny: All right, well, what do you want to do?// Amy: There’s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.// Penny: Well, that’s Wilshire’s problem. Come on, you know, there, there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.// Leonard: Hang on, why do we have to hate it?// Penny: Three words, Doctor Who convention.// Leonard: I did not force you to go to that.// Penny: You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn’t get beat up.// Leonard: I wasn’t gonna get beat up.// Penny: You were, but somehow I held myself back.// Sheldon: You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.// Leonard: Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?// Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, I’m a problem-solver, it’s what I do.// Amy: I actually can’t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.// Penny: Is there any part of your body that’s normal?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Raj: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.// Howard: Will you please relax?// Raj: I can’t take it, dude.// Bernadette: You okay?// Raj: No, I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin.// Bernadette: I told you not to wax down there. It’s itchy when it grows back.// Raj: I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.// Bernadette: What’s he talking about?// Howard: Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.// Raj: We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.// Howard: Now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.// Raj: Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.// Amy: Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.// Sheldon: Before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog.// Penny: How come we can’t think of something we both want to do?// Amy: Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.// Leonard: Ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.// Sheldon: You should point out the hypocrisy of that.// Leonard: That’s what I was doing.// Sheldon: Oh, that wasn’t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?// Penny: All right, keep thinking.// Sheldon: You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?// Leonard: Well, yeah.// Sheldon: Well, then, it’s settled?// Amy: What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.// Penny: It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.// Sheldon: Well, once again, it’s what I do.// Raj: Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.// Howard: I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…// Raj: Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?// Howard: A story can do two things.// Raj: Ugh, I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack.// Howard: You work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?// Bernadette: All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack.// Raj: I can’t stop thinking about it.// Bernadette: You know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens.// Raj: I know.// Howard: Maybe you need to do something more productive.// Raj: Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.// Howard: So, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.// Raj: Yes.// Howard: The man who crashed his stationary bike.// Raj: I didn’t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.// Howard: You happy? Now you can relax.// Raj: What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.// Scene: A clothes shop.// Leonard: This isn’t so bad.// Sheldon: That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that’s a lot of panties.// Amy: You guys comfy? This might take a while.// Sheldon: I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.// Penny: No, you’re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.// Sheldon: They have a man there who understands my personal style.// Penny: Bye.// Leonard: Uh, I’ve got some bad news. There’s no cell service in here.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, that’s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.// Leonard: That’s true.// Sheldon: I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.// Leonard: Sheldon, it’s fine.// Sheldon: No, it’s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have Wi-Fi? I’m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.// Scene: The same, later.// Sheldon: Let’s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.// Leonard: Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.// Sheldon: Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it. I wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here.// Leonard: I don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It’s the least we can do.// Sheldon: Oh, that’s true. I suppose it’s only fair we make compromises.// Leonard: Look at you, being all mature.// Sheldon: I don’t know why you’re so surprised. If there’s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise.// Leonard: I, I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?// Sheldon: All the time.// Leonard: On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we’re living?// Sheldon: Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you.// Leonard: That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.// Sheldon: Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.// Leonard: What? Then. then why don’t you do it?// Sheldon: Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.// Scene: Raj’s car.// Raj: Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.// Howard: I’m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?// Raj: If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple.// Howard: Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels.// Raj: I meant a Hindu temple.// Howard: Oh. Okay. It’s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out.// Raj: Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.// Howard: You love that movie.// Raj: Yeah, it’s pretty great.// Howard: I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.// Raj: Why?// Howard: Well, because I’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.// Raj: Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don’t talk about it.// Howard: Yeah, but you’re a scientist.// Raj: So?// Howard: So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?// Raj: That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?// Howard: No. There’s also Apu from The Simpsons.// Raj: Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.// Howard: Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.// Raj: Actually there’s no proof of that.// Howard: You believe in your religion, I’ll believe in mine.// Scene: The store changing rooms.// Amy: How’s it going in there?// Penny: Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?// Amy: Sure.// Penny: Do I really force you to do things you don’t want to?// Amy: Yeah, but it’s okay.// Penny: How is it okay?// Amy: I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I’d do whatever they said. Really, I’m lucky you found me before a cult did.// Penny: Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want.// Amy: Really?// Penny: Absolutely. You name it, we’re doing it.// Amy: Basket weaving at the craft museum.// Penny: Well, you named it.// Scene: The store.// Sheldon: Oh, here’s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don’t put it there because I don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast.// Leonard: Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?// Sheldon: I wasn’t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.// Leonard: Because of you, I’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I’m not allowed to whistle. I don’t wear shoes that might squeak.// Sheldon: Well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown.// Leonard: Sheldon, do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.// Sheldon: Is that true?// Leonard: Yes, it’s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.// Sheldon: Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.// Leonard: You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.// Sheldon: You know what? You think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.// Leonard: Sheldon, I, I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.// Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.// Leonard: Do you mean that?// Sheldon: Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.// Leonard: Come on, don’t get upset.// Sheldon: I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.// Leonard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: It’s okay.// Leonard: I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall.// Sheldon: I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.// Leonard: Buddy.// Penny: How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?// Leonard: Everything’s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.// Amy: Are you crazy? You know he’s a flight risk.// Sheldon: That’s exactly what I told him.// Penny: Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready.// Sheldon: Well, what if you did it gradually?// Leonard: All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?// Sheldon: How about one night and I let you whistle?// Leonard: Okay.// Sheldon: When I’m not home.// Leonard: You got it.// Sheldon: There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.// Scene: The temple car park.// Howard: Here we go, my first Hindu temple.// Raj: You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.// Howard: Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.// Raj: All right. Shall we?// Howard: Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?// Raj: Like what?// Howard: Like am I dressed okay?// Raj: Really? So every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?// Howard: I know you’re under a lot of pressure, so I’m gonna let that pass.// Raj: Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us.// Howard: That’s nice.// Raj: Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs.// Howard: Raj.// Raj: You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.// Howard: Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It’s fine.// Raj: Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.// Scene: The craft museum.// Leonard: I thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun.// Penny: Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday.// Amy: Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.// Sheldon: It’s not a basket. It’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century China.// Amy: Very nice.// Leonard: Yeah, it looks great.// Sheldon: I saw that.// Scene: Penny’s bedroom.// Leonard: Well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start.// Penny: I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon.// Leonard: Yeah, I’m proud of him, too.// Sheldon (in Penny’s living room): Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.// (in Penny’s living room)Series 08 Episode 13 – The Anxiety Optimisation// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Okay, we’re headed out, see you later.// Sheldon: Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?// Leonard: Yeah, sure.// Sheldon: Okay. Go ahead.// Leonard: Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.// Penny: Uh, Bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada.// Leonard: Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.// Penny: Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.// Leonard: Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever.// Sheldon: Aw, now I’m sad I didn’t hear it.// Penny: So what do you need the headphones for?// Sheldon: Well, I’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.// Penny: Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?// Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.// Penny: Yeah, have fun.// Sheldon: Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.// Penny: And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.// Leonard: Bye.// Sheldon: Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay.// (Time shift)// Leonard: Hey, we’re home. Any progress?// Sheldon: How could there be, with these constant interruptions?// Penny: I love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one.// Credits sequence.// Leonard: What are you doing? It’s time to go.// Sheldon: I’m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?// Leonard: Ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?// Sheldon: Like a big old baby.// Leonard: Call me if you need anything.// Sheldon: I’ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.// Penny (off): Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!// (off)// // Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Penny (off): Ugh!// Penny: Ugh, what?// Sheldon: You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.// Penny: Oh, I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.// Sheldon: Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.// Penny: I don’t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.// Sheldon: And to clarify?// Penny: The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?// Sheldon: I’m not going. Would you like to know why?// Penny: Uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?// Sheldon: Boy, I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Howard: I invented a game. You want to play?// Leonard: Sure.// Howard: It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.// Raj: Go ahead, make fun. You can’t embarrass me, I’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.// Howard: Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it.// Raj: I may not be liking this game so much.// Leonard: Cinnamon. Give me another one.// Howard: Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.// Leonard: We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.// Raj: You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It’s not strange.// Leonard: Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.// Sheldon: Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself.// Howard: What do you mean?// Sheldon: According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I’d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.// Howard: Hold on. What’s in it for us?// Sheldon: Well, I suppose…// Howard: Okay, we’ll do it.// Scene: Amy’s laboratory.// Sheldon: Done.// Amy: 33 seconds. Okay, that’ll be our baseline.// Sheldon: You know, I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.// Amy: It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.// Sheldon: And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster.// Amy: All right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.// Sheldon: Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy.// Amy: Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?// Sheldon: I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.// Amy: Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.// Sheldon: Who eats them horizontally?// Amy: My mother said that’s how good girls do it.// Sheldon: Perhaps this was a waste of time.// Amy: Sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Amy: And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?// Sheldon: Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…// Amy: Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.// Sheldon: Really? Oh, that’s fantastic. Now, wait, they’re dropping. Why are they dropping?// Amy: Because you’re happy they’re elevated.// Sheldon: Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.// Raj: All right, guys, what game do you want to play?// Howard: Let’s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?// Raj: You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships.// Howard: Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.// Leonard: That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.// Leonard: So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?// Sheldon: Yes.// Raj: And you think that’s going to help?// Howard: Well, I don’t think that’s gonna help at all.// Sheldon: Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I’ll become more focused.// Leonard: Howard’s right, that’ll never work.// Sheldon: Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically valid. I’m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.// Raj: I don’t think that’s what you want at all.// Sheldon: Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?// Leonard: Because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said.// Sheldon: I ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it.// Howard: Yes, we can.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, then do it.// Howard: Nah.// Sheldon: You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.// Amy: That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.// Penny: Yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.// Amy: If I were going to Hawaii, I’d spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?// Penny: Really? Want to go to Hawaii?// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies?// Penny: Come in.// Sheldon: Ladies.// Penny: What’s up?// Sheldon: Well, as you may know, I’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?// Penny: What exactly do you think goes on here?// Sheldon: Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.// Bernadette: We were talking about Penny’s job.// Sheldon: And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.// Penny: Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.// Sheldon: You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?// Penny: Let’s just talk about our periods.// Amy: No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?// Bernadette: Well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. They’re a werewolf, that’s only part wolf. It’s like comparing apples to oranges.// Sheldon: Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye.// Leonard: What is going on?// Sheldon: Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.// Leonard: Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I’m trying to sleep. Good night.// Sheldon: Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Amy: You’ve been working so much lately, I’m glad you didn’t forget about date night.// Sheldon: Of course.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Yeah.// Amy: Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.// Sheldon: I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.// Amy: Fine. How was your day?// Sheldon: Oh, you said it.// Amy: Sheldon. Sheldon, I’m worried about you. You’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.// Sheldon: I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.// Howard: Okay, so it’s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you’re the tiebreaker.// Penny: Say the quote again.// Howard: It’s just so perfect that we’re both Libras.// Penny: Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon.// Howard: Yes.// Penny: Yes.// Raj: Come on.// Howard: That was the last one, I promise. We won’t play any more.// Raj: Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.// Bernadette: Emily’s feelings?// Raj: Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?// Penny: Date night.// Leonard: That can’t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.// Bernadette: What happened?// Leonard: He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.// Bernadette: Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?// Howard: I don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody.// Leonard: You didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.// Sheldon: He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.// Raj: Wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.// Howard: Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?// Amy: Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.// Sheldon: That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.// Amy: I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.// Sheldon: There you go, perfect.// Amy: Sheldon, stop it, I’m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.// Sheldon: But after months of struggling, I’m finally making progress.// Amy: You don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.// Sheldon: Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.// Amy: That’s not true.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately.// Amy: Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.// Sheldon: Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?// Amy: Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.// Sheldon: Hmm, perhaps. But I’m not taking the cap off.// Amy: It’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I’m telling you for the last time, take the cap off.// Sheldon: Oh, really? What if I don’t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?// Scene: A bus.// Sheldon: And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.// Man: Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?// Sheldon: I knew you’d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Penny: Okay.// Leonard: Here we are.// Sheldon: Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn’t in here.// Leonard: You lie down, he’ll be here in a minute.// Sheldon: Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.// Penny: Now, you just get comfortable.// Sheldon: No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it’s poster time.// Leonard: Maybe in the morning.// Penny: Yeah, you get some sleep.// Sheldon: No, I don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me.// Penny: You’re right, we can’t.// Sheldon: Yeah, darn straight, you can’t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.// Penny (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty.// (singing)// Leonard (singing): Little ball of fur.// Sheldon: That’s not gonna work.// Penny (singing): Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.// Together (singing): Purr, purr, purr.// Leonard: You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.// Penny: Mmmm.// Howard: You look like you got some rest.// Sheldon: Oh, I’m feeling much better. And I’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.// Leonard: I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.// Raj: Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?// Howard: Yeah, no problem.// Sheldon: Of course not.// Emily: So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.// Howard: Well, um, we were just kidding around.// Emily: Well, you may think it’s funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it’s sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?Series 08 Episode 14 – The Troll Manifestation// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?// Leonard: Wow, you remember that?// Penny: Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.// Leonard: You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.// Penny: And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?// Leonard: Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.// Penny: Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm.// Leonard: Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?// Penny: No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.// Leonard: Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…// Penny: Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving.// Leonard: No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.// Penny: Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?// Sheldon: Hmm.// Leonard: What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?// Leonard: I know this isn’t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?// Sheldon: Well, you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers.// Leonard: No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?// Sheldon: It’s good.// Leonard: Really?// Sheldon: I like it. I think you’re on to something.// Leonard: You do? You’re not messing with me?// Sheldon: Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.// Leonard: You’re giving me a sticker?// Sheldon: Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.// Leonard: I’m not a preschooler.// Sheldon: Fine, I’ll take it back.// Leonard: I earned this. Back off.// Credits sequence.// Leonard: You’re still awake?// Sheldon: For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.// Leonard: You worked out all the math.// Sheldon: Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.// Leonard: You wrote a paper on my idea?// Sheldon: I wrote a paper on our idea.// Leonard: When did my idea become our idea?// Sheldon: When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.// Leonard: This is good. Our idea is really good.// Sheldon: Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.// Leonard: You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.// Sheldon: Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn’t gonna do it without you.// Leonard: Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?// Sheldon: We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.// Leonard: You’re sure it’s good?// Sheldon: My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.// Leonard: Okay, partner, let’s do it.// Sheldon: Come on. Click the mouse with me.// Leonard: One, two three.// Together: Click.// Leonard: Well, we did it.// Sheldon: Yes, we did, my friend.// Leonard: Is your tongue blue?// Sheldon: I don’t want to talk about it.// Bernadette: Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?// Amy: Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?// Penny: Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.// Bernadette: Search for it.// Penny: What, no, why?// Bernadette: ‘Cause it would be fun to watch.// Penny: It would be humiliating.// Bernadette: Well, now we have two reasons.// Amy: They have it.// Bernadette: Please, can we watch it?// Amy: Please?// Penny: Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible.// Amy: Have you even seen it?// Penny: No.// Bernadette: Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.// Voice on TV: Bananas, get your fresh bananas.// Bernadette: Ho-ho, it really didn’t.// Scene: Leonard’s laboratory.// Leonard: Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.// Sheldon: Does it smell like blueberries?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Then we’re probably okay.// Howard: Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.// Leonard: Really? What’d they say?// Howard: Uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board.// Leonard: Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative.// Sheldon: Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.// Leonard: Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?// Sheldon: I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.// Howard: How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?// Raj: Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.// Sheldon: Read another one.// Leonard: Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.// Sheldon: Who wrote that?// Leonard: It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.// Sheldon: Well, I’m responding to it.// Leonard: Uh, don’t lower yourself to their level.// Sheldon: Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.// Leonard: Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this.// Sheldon: He just left another comment.// Raj: What does it say?// Leonard: Upon review, I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.// Sheldon: Can I respond now?// Leonard: Do it.// Sheldon: You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.// Leonard: Somebody else do it.// Penny (on television): Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.// (on television)// Doctor: Why do you think you’re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?// Penny (on television): Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.// Penny: Okay, we’ve seen plenty.// Bernadette: No, give me the remote.// Amy: Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off.// Penny: Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more.// Amy: What is it?// Penny: Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.// Amy: What?// Bernadette: Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.// Amy: I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.// Bernadette (on screen): Hi. I’m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.// (on screen)// Penny: You look like a talking cupcake.// Bernadette (on screen): And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to (singing) tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.// (singing)// Amy: Play it again. Play it again.// Raj: Did he respond yet?// Sheldon: Hmm. No, not yet.// Leonard: Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level.// Howard: It wasn’t that bad.// Leonard: Read it back one more time.// Sheldon: My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.// Leonard: And you don’t think that’s too rough?// Sheldon: We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.// Penny: How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?// Bernadette: ‘Cause it’s embarrassing.// Penny: It is; it truly is.// Bernadette: Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.// Amy: Why? What did I do?// Bernadette: Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.// Penny: Okay. We are reading that right now.// Amy: No, please don’t.// Bernadette: We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.// Amy: But it’s personal.// Penny: Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?// Amy: No.// Penny: Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon.// Amy: It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.// Penny: Please show us?// Bernadette: Please?// Penny: You know I’m gonna read it either way.// Amy: Good luck finding it.// Penny: Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.// Bernadette: Why? Why did it feel different?// Penny: Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.// Amy: You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I’m starting to miss that.// Sheldon: He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?// Leonard: Do you really want him to write back?// Sheldon: Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?// Leonard: Me-wow.// Howard: What are you doing?// Raj: I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.// Howard: This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.// Raj: No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.// Sheldon: He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?// Howard: Yes.// Raj: Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.// Sheldon: Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating.// Raj: Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.// Howard: Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.// Raj: See? Better with the accent.// Sheldon: And send.// Leonard: What did you write?// Sheldon: I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.// Leonard: What does that mean?// Sheldon: I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.// Leonard: Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.// Raj: Come on, Sheldon!// Sheldon: Oh, okay, okay, calm down. (Skype tone) It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world.// (Skype tone) I// Leonard: Oh, really?// Penny: “Time travel? I don’t understand,” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”// Bernadette: Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting.// Amy: He’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It’s called good writing. And wishful thinking.// Penny: It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.// Bernadette: Here we go.// Penny: Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.// Bernadette: Oh, Amelia.// Penny: So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.// Amy: In the 1800s that was considered flirting.// Raj: I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.// Howard: Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face.// Sheldon: Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.// Leonard: Never noticed that about you.// Raj: You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.// Sheldon: He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.// Leonard: All right, do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished.// Sheldon: Click it with me. One, two, three, click.// Stephen Hawking: Well, hello there.// Sheldon: Professor Hawking?// Stephen Hawking: Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.// Leonard: You really didn’t like our paper?// Stephen Hawking: I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.// Sheldon: Then why are you attacking us?// Stephen Hawking: If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you’d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.// Leonard: Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.// Sheldon: Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.// Leonard: And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.// Howard: How do you do, Mr. I’ll-Admit-That’s-Pretty-Cool?// Raj: Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.// Penny: With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.// Bernadette: Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.// Amy: Okay, that’s enough.// Penny: What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.// Amy: You’re just making fun of me.// Bernadette: I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good.// Penny: No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?// Amy: Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia’s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can’t stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don’t go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.// Bernadette: But they didn’t even kiss.// Amy: She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.// Penny: Yes.// Amy: “What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…// Leonard: You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.// Penny: Get out!// Bernadette: Not now!// Scene: An 1800’s house.// Amelia: Is the water warm enough?// Cooper: Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it’s a little nippy.// Amelia: I can fix that. I couldn’t help but notice your unusual undergarments.// Cooper: They’re not undergarments. They’re Underoos. Where I come from, they’re known as underwear that’s fun to wear.// Amelia: And what’s the significance of the spider?// Cooper: Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.// Amelia: There’s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn’t there?// Leonard (in bed): You’re right. This is even weirder than I thought.// (in bed)// Penny: You want me to stop reading?// Leonard: Are you kidding? No, no.// Penny: As he stood for Amelia to dry him…// Amelia: So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?// Leonard: Yeah, okay, I’m good.Series 08 Episode 15 – The Comic Book Store Regeneration// Scene: Amy’s laboratory.// Sheldon: I’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?// Amy: Sure.// Sheldon: How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?// Amy: How many?// Sheldon: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.// Amy: Is that really true?// Sheldon: Of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.// Barry: Hey, sowwy to intewupt.// Sheldon: Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?// Barry: Did you know Edison didn’t actuawy invent the wight bulb?// Sheldon: What do you want, Barry?// Barry: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.// Amy: What’s this for?// Barry: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper’s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.// Amy: Well, that’s fascinating. I can’t wait to read it.// Sheldon: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.// Barry: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.// Sheldon: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?// Amy: Well, I’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal.// Sheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?// Amy: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.// Sheldon: That’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.// Amy: Sheldon, we’re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You’re being petty.// Sheldon: I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Howard (on phone): Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.// (on phone)// Bernadette: Your mom having fun in Florida?// Howard: Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.// Bernadette: She’s just being nice.// Howard: Well, I’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if I’m lonely?// Bernadette: Because you have a wife.// Howard: Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.// Bernadette: I know you don’t like Stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, I’m sure he’ll get back on his feet.// Howard: That would be great. I’d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.// Bernadette: Well, normal’s a strong word, but sure.// Scene: The laundry room.// Penny: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Penny: You okay?// Sheldon: If I was okay, I would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.// Penny: What’s going on?// Sheldon: I’m mad at Amy.// Penny: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?// Sheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.// Penny: Oh, that sounds like a good thing.// Sheldon: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I’m sorry you had to see that.// Penny: I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera.// Sheldon: Why would she do this to me?// Penny: Well, I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?// Sheldon: No, I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science.// Penny: All right, well, if I’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I’m thinking you might have to let this one go.// Sheldon: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel.// Penny: I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, why don’t you talk to her?// Sheldon: Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?// Penny: Well, you could shove them somewhere.// Sheldon: Okay, now you’re getting creative.// Scene: The comic book store.// Stuart: Thanks again for your help.// Leonard: No problem.// Raj: Our pleasure.// Leonard: The place really looks great.// Raj: Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.// Stuart: I keep telling you I didn’t burn it down.// Leonard: We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.// Bernadette: Stuart, this place looks amazing.// Stuart: Thanks.// Howard: You really did a nice job.// Stuart: And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom’s through all this. I couldn’t have done it otherwise.// Howard: I appreciate that, and I’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?// Stuart: Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn’t it look great?// Howard: Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.// Bernadette: Howie.// Howard: Why don’t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.// Stuart: What is your problem? She said it was okay.// Howard: Well, I’m her son, and I say it’s not okay.// Stuart: Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.// Howard: Well, maybe I should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother.// Bernadette: Why don’t we leave so you can cool off?// Stuart: I think that’s a good idea. Take him out of my store.// Howard: Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I’m not going anywhere.// Leonard: Why don’t we go get the food for the party.// Stuart: Thank you.// Raj: Smart, looks like we’re being helpful.// Leonard: Mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Sheldon: Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I’m so… Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?// Penny: No.// Sheldon: Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?// Penny: I don’t know, just think about something else.// Sheldon: Can I think about the spiny anteater?// Penny: Sure.// Sheldon: The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all.// Penny: You know, some people try visualization.// Sheldon: How does that work?// Penny: Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.// Sheldon: Okay.// Penny: Now imagine you’re holding that pen.// Penny: Now open your hand and let it go.// Sheldon: But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look.// Penny: Sheldon, this isn’t that hard.// Sheldon: I may have a better way that you can teach me.// Penny: How?// Sheldon: What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?// Penny: What? She didn’t give me any puzzles.// Sheldon: Are you sure?// Amy (in flashback): Boy, I just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?// (in flashback)// Amy (in flashback): Darn it. There’s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?// Amy (in flashback): Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.// Penny: Son of a bitch.// Sheldon: Okay, that’s great. Now, let it go.// Penny: I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.// Sheldon: Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.// Penny: Why would she even do this?// Sheldon: She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?// Penny: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?// Sheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting?// Penny: It’s not interesting. It’s incredibly insulting.// Sheldon: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard.// Penny: Oh, my, that’s it. Get out.// Sheldon: I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.// Penny: Get out.// Sheldon: Penny?// Penny: What?// Sheldon: I think I left my pen in there.// Bernadette: I understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it’s just furniture.// Howard: It’s my mom’s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.// Bernadette: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.// Howard: That is a good point. But I didn’t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I’m being.// Bernadette: This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.// Scene: A deli.// Leonard: Hi, we’re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.// Waitress: Sure, let me go check on that.// Raj: Dude, I, I think that’s Nathan Fillion.// Leonard: Oh yeah, look at that.// Raj: And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.// Leonard: We’re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.// Raj: No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store, that would be amazing.// Leonard: That would be great.// Raj: So should we go talk to him?// Leonard: I don’t know. I mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.// Raj: What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.// Leonard: He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.// Raj: I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.// Nathan Fillion: Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I’m not an actor.// Raj: Don’t say that. I mean, you’re not Dame Judi Dench, but you’re pretty great.// Nathan Fillion: Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I’m Nathan Fillion, but I’m not. So if you don’t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.// Leonard: Come on. Sorry to bother you.// Raj: Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I’m still floating.// Scene: The hallway.// Amy: Sheldon, it’s me.// Penny: Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.// Amy: What are you talking about?// Penny: I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.// Amy: Sheldon, open the door.// Sheldon: I can’t. I’m naked.// Amy: I just saw you.// Sheldon: Hang on.// Penny: Open the door now.// Amy: Oh, hey.// Penny: Pull up your pants.// Amy: It’s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.// Penny: I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity.// Amy: So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?// Scene: The deli.// Leonard: Thank you.// Raj: Thanks.// Leonard: Sorry again.// Nathan Fillion: No problem.// Raj: Are you sure you’re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We’re scientists, not crazy fanboys.// Nathan Fillion: All right, fine. I’m him.// Raj: And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it, you’re not him.// Nathan Fillion: I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let’s take a picture.// Raj: Great.// Leonard: Yeah, thank you.// Nathan Fillion: You bet.// Raj: Wait, hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion, what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?// Nathan Fillion: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.// Leonard: That’s it, that’s the line.// Raj: Although, I knew the line, doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion.// Nathan Fillion: Do you want the picture or not?// Raj: I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.// Nathan: How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?// Leonard: What do you think?// Raj: Ah, it’s good enough for Facebook.// Leonard: I can’t believe they did that.// Penny: I know, it’s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.// Leonard: Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.// Penny: Unbelievable.// Leonard: And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.// Penny: Really? You couldn’t get it out?// Sheldon: Thank you.// Amy: Wow, the store looks great.// Leonard: So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?// Penny: Eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings.// Amy: That’s not true.// Sheldon: That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.// Amy: Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.// Howard: I’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy.// Bernadette: Can you please just let it go?// Sheldon: Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.// Howard: Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?// (On phone)// Amy: How can I make this up to you?// Penny: The answer’s in this puzzle box. Let’s see if you can open it.// Stuart: You could have at least warned him about the furniture.// Raj: That’s what I said when we moved it.// Bernadette: You helped him?// Raj: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.// Leonard: Hey, you okay?// Howard: No.// Leonard: What’s wrong?// Howard: My mom died.// Bernadette: What?// Howard: Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.// Bernadette: Oh, my God, Howie.// Leonard: I’m so sorry.// Raj: What can we do?// Howard: I don’t know.// Sheldon: May I say something?// Leonard: Not right now, Sheldon.// Sheldon: But I think it would be comforting.// Leonard: Buddy.// Howard: No, it’s okay. What?// Sheldon: When I lost my own father, I didn’t have any friends to help me through it. You do.// Penny: I really thought he was gonna say let it go.// Scene: The apartment.// Raj (on phone): Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they’ve booked a flight. They’re heading to the airport now.// Penny: How’s Howard holding up?// Raj: He’s hanging in there.// Leonard: How are you doing, Stuart?// Stuart: Still can’t believe she’s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn’t for her, I, I would have been homeless.// Amy: One of us would have taken you in.// Stuart: Yeah, I don’t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I’m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.// Raj: Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.// Penny: Whenever I saw her, she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.// Amy: She did that to me, too.// Penny: Don’t take this away from me.// Sheldon: I didn’t care for her yelling. But now that I’m not going to hear it again, I’m sad.// Leonard: If you want, I can yell at you later.// Sheldon: It won’t be as good.// Leonard: Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you.Series 08 Episode 16 – The Intimacy Acceleration// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.// Leonard: That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.// Penny: Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.// Raj: Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.// Amy: And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.// Sheldon: Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.// Amy: Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.// Penny: Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?// Raj: What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.// Leonard: I’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?// Penny: Oh, careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.// Sheldon: Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…// Amy: No.// Sheldon: You didn’t even let me finish.// Amy: Forget it.// Sheldon: So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I’m the monster.// Raj: Why don’t you just do the test?// Sheldon: In the interest of science, I’d be willing to.// Penny: What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?// Sheldon: Yes.// Penny: Please, can I do it with him? Please?// Leonard: I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you’re it.// Raj: Yeah, but what if the experiment works?// Penny: I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.// Amy: That’s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.// Sheldon: Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.// Leonard: In love yet?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The hallway.// Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.// Penny: You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.// Sheldon: Okay, babe, let’s do this.// Raj: You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d, I’d be a little nervous.// Amy: Why?// Raj: Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?// Amy: I think we’re safe.// Raj: Well, that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.// Leonard: Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?// Amy: The two of us could do it.// Leonard: Yeah, sure, that might be fun.// Amy: What’s the first question?// Raj: Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?// Leonard: Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.// Amy: Oh, then I choose a janitor, ’cause I’m about to throw up.// Leonard: I’m in love. Let’s do something else.// Raj: Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?// Leonard: Okay.// Amy: Sounds good.// Leonard: Should we call Howard and Bernadette?// Raj: I don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.// Amy: Did he say anything about the funeral?// Raj: Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.// Scene: An airport baggage desk.// Howard: Are you kidding me? You lost my mother’s ashes?// Baggage Clerk: No, I’m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.// Howard: All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,// first, I meant first.// Clerk: I just need some information. Uh, what’s the flight number?// Bernadette: Eight sixteen.// Howard: I really did mean first.// Bernadette: Just drop it.// Clerk: And can you describe the bag?// Bernadette: Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle.// Howard: The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Sheldon: You ready to begin?// Penny: Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.// Sheldon: Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.// Penny: What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.// Sheldon: Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…// Penny: Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?// Sheldon: Hmm. Living or dead?// Penny: Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.// Sheldon: Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself.// Penny: You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.// Sheldon: Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?// Penny: Robert Downey, Jr.// Sheldon: Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.// Scene: Raj’s car.// Raj: So, what do you guys want to do?// Amy: Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick.// Emily: Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?// Leonard: What’s that?// Emily: Um, it’s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There’s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.// Raj: Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.// Sheldon: What would constitute a perfect day for you?// Penny: Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.// Sheldon: That’s it?// Penny: Yeah, why?// Sheldon: You didn’t mention Leonard.// Penny: He’s there.// Sheldon: I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.// Penny: Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?// Sheldon: Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.// Penny: Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy.// Sheldon: Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?// Scene: An escape room.// Woman in lab coat: You’re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?// Leonard: Ladies?// Emily: Are you being polite or scared?// Leonard: Yup.// Emily: Ah, what a room!// Amy: Oh.// Leonard: This is cool.// Amy: So, how do we start?// Emily: We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.// Raj: Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?// Zombie: Uuuuuuuh!// Raj: Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.// Scene: The Baggage Claim.// Clerk: Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.// Bernadette: So, where is it?// Clerk: I don’t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?// Howard: So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?// Clerk: I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could’ve gotten on an international flight.// Howard: Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.// Clerk: I’m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.// Sheldon: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?// Penny: Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.// Sheldon: I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.// Penny: Come on, I’m just having some fun with you.// Sheldon: I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.// Penny: Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.// Sheldon: Ha. Keep dreaming.// Penny: Sheldon.// Shedon: I’m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that’s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people’s minds.// Penny: Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.// Sheldon: When are we going to get robot eyes?// Penny: You’re all alike.// Sheldon: Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful.// Penny: Really? You always seem so confident.// Sheldon: Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler.// Penny: Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Penny: Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.// Sheldon: You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?// Penny: And the wave is gone.// Scene: The escape room.// Zombie: Brains!// Amy: Keep it down, we’re working here.// Raj: Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded.// Emily: How’s it going with the globe?// Amy: We used the coordinates to locate the cities.// Leonard: I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.// Zombie: Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!// Leonard: Yup. Got the code.// Zombie: Just saying, no refund for finish early!// Scene: The baggage check.// Bernadette: Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us.// Howard: No, I’m not leaving without her.// Bernadette: All right, we’ll wait.// Howard: I could’ve driven her.// Bernadette: What?// Howard: The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.// Bernadette: There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?// Clerk: Yes?// Bernadette: You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.// Leonard: Which book are we looking for?// Raj: Uh, Origin of Species.// Leonard: Here it is. There’s a black light.// Emily: Oh, hang on.// Raj: Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.// Amy: Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son.// Emily: Ooh. There’s a picture of the sun over there.// Leonard: I bet the key’s behind it.// Zombie: Could be somewhere else.// Emily: Oh, got the key.// Amy: So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?// Leonard: We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?// Raj: It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.// Emily: Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.// Amy: Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.// Zombie: Remember that before you post on Yelp.// Penny: If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?// Sheldon: So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.// Penny: Today’s your birthday?// Penny: Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.// Sheldon: Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut.// Penny: So, why did you finally tell me?// Sheldon: The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.// Penny: Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone.// Penny: That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.// Sheldon: You’re making it difficult to love you right now.// Clerk: Great news, your bag was returned.// Howard: Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here.// Bernadette: Okay, thank you so much.// Howard: Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.// Bernadette: Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom.// Sheldon: That’s it. We’re done with the questions.// Penny: All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.// Sheldon: Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go.// Penny: You ready?// Penny: And begin. This is kind of creepy.// Sheldon: We’re not supposed to talk during this part.// Penny: Sorry.// Sheldon: This is kind of creepy.// Penny: Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.// Sheldon: Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.// Penny: Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too.// Sheldon: Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.// Penny: I meant more like a little brother.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.// Penny: It’s getting creepy again.// Sheldon: What?// Penny: Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.// Sheldon: It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.// Penny: Can you believe it’s been eight years?// Sheldon: Yeah, and you’re still eating our food.// Penny: I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.// Sheldon: I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.// Penny: That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.// Sheldon: No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.// Penny: Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.// Sheldon: And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make.// Penny: Like what?// Sheldon: Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?// Sheldon: Thank you for walking me home.// Penny: I just want to make sure you get there safe.// Sheldon: Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening.// Penny: It really has.// All: SURPRISE!// Sheldon: Aah! And after I let you be Gary.Series 08 Episode 17 – The Colonization Application// Scene: The stairwell.// Leonard: I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.// Penny: Again, it was miniature golf.// Leonard: Admit it, you’re a little turned on.// Penny: You can’t be this proud.// Leonard: Why not?// Penny: Because I beat you.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: Hi.// Sheldon: Oh, good. You’re back.// Amy: We have some exciting news.// Leonard: Okay.// Sheldon: As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.// Penny: Okay.// Amy: After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.// Sheldon: Do you want to say it?// Amy: Let’s say it together.// Together: We’re getting a turtle.// Penny: This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.// Sheldon: Sarcasm?// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.// Leonard: Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.// Penny: Yes.// Amy: Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.// Sheldon: No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.// Leonard: Why a turtle?// Sheldon: After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.// Amy: For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.// Sheldon: Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.// Leonard: Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?// Penny: Mm-hmm.// Amy: That’s what I said.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Emily’s apartment.// Raj: So, where’s your roommate tonight?// Emily: Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.// Raj: But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.// Emily: And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.// Raj: That’s okay. I can come back later.// Emily: No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here.// Raj: Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.// Emily: Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.// Raj: Oh, good.// Emily: Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.// Scene: A pet store.// Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.// Amy: It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.// Sheldon: That was a lot of puppies.// Amy: Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?// Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?// Amy: Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.// Sheldon: I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.// Amy: But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.// Sheldon: Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.// Amy: What are you talking about?// Sheldon: Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.// Amy: You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?// Sheldon: Would you have approved?// Amy: Of course not.// Sheldon: Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.// Penny: Aw, is this your first time?// Leonard: No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.// Penny: Well, why?// Leonard: Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.// Penny: You went to the dirty store without me?// Leonard: In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.// Penny: Well, get it. Get it for me.// Leonard: Yeah?// Penny: Yeah.// Leonard: Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.// Penny: Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?// Leonard: No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.// Penny: Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.// Leonard: You’re making fun of me. Forget it.// Penny: No. No, come on, I want to do it.// Leonard: Really?// Penny: Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.// Leonard: Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Howard: How are the taxes going?// Bernadette: Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.// Howard: Those are business expenses. You can write those off.// Bernadette: A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?// Howard: Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. (On phone) Hey, what’s up?// (On phone)// Raj: Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?// Howard: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.// Raj: What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?// Howard: She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.// Raj: So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.// Howard: What’s wrong?// Raj: I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.// Howard: So?// Raj: She’s gonna know I was looking in it.// Howard: Why were you looking in it?// Raj: Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.// Howard: Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.// Raj: Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.// Howard: You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.// Raj: Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.// Bernadette: What’s happening?// Howard: Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.// Bernadette: Aw. I’m gonna miss her.// Scene: Penny’s bedroom.// Penny: So what do you think?// Leonard: I thought it’d be a little more, just more.// Penny: I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?// Leonard: Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.// Penny: Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.// Leonard: Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?// Penny: Almost 1am.// Leonard: Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.// Penny: Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.// Leonard: Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.// Sheldon: I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.// Amy: No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.// Sheldon: I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.// Amy: I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.// Sheldon: Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.// Amy: Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.// Sheldon: So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?// Amy: I would at least mention it before filling out the application.// Sheldon: Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.// Amy: And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.// Sheldon: First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.// Amy: You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?// Amy: No. Forget it.// Sheldon: What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?// Amy: Please don’t.// Sheldon: Yep, you’re mad.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Howard is on the phone to Raj.// Howard: Okay, let me see the damage.// Raj: Hang on.// Howard: Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.// Raj: With what?// Howard: Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?// Raj: She does.// Howard: Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.// Raj: Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?// Sheldon: I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.// Amy: Why do you even want to do this?// Sheldon: Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?// Amy: Can’t you just tell me?// Sheldon: But I made a video.// Sheldon (on video): I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?// (on video)// Leonard (on video): You mean this weirdly suspicious one?// (on video):// Sheldon (on video): Yes. Open it and check.// Leonard (on video): I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.// Sheldon (on video): But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.// Sheldon: Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.// Scene: Penny’s bathroom.// Leonard: Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.// Penny: How did you get paint in your eye?// Leonard: Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.// Scene: Emily’s bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard.// Raj: This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.// Howard: It’s fine. You just need two more nails.// Raj: Okay, where should I put them?// Howard: In Emily’s eyes.// Raj: You’re not helping.// Bernadette: Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.// Raj: You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…// Emily: Raj? I’m back.// Raj: Oh, no. Hey.// Emily: Hi.// Raj: How was the hospital?// Emily: Fine. What were you doing in there?// Raj: Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.// Emily: You were looking in my night stand?// Raj: Yeah.// Emily: So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?// Raj: You’ve never snooped around my apartment?// Emily: No.// Raj: Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.// Emily: I can’t believe you don’t trust me.// Bernadette: She sounds really mad.// Howard: We should hang up.// Bernadette: Yeah, we should.// Howard: But we’re not going to, are we?// Bernadette: Not a chance.// Howard: What happened to snooping is wrong?// Bernadette: Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?// Leonard: Well, we did it.// Penny: We sure did.// Leonard: I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.// Penny: Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.// Leonard: So, where do we want to hang it?// Penny: What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.// Leonard: But it’s an expression of our love.// Penny: And our butts. Not hanging it.// Leonard: Seems a shame to throw it away.// Penny: Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.// Leonard: God, I love you. I love you so much.// Amy: I think I’m gonna go home.// Sheldon: Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.// Amy: You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.// Sheldon: Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.// Amy: Sure. Unless something better comes along.// Sheldon: Do you want me to withdraw my application?// Amy: What I want is for us to be planning our future together.// Sheldon: And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.// Amy: We’re on the same planet.// Sheldon: Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?// Amy: Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?// Sheldon: I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?// Amy: Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.// Sheldon: Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?// Amy: You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.// Sheldon: You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?// Amy: Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.// Sheldon: They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?// Amy: I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.// Sheldon: Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.// Scene: Emily’s bedroom.// Raj: Thank you for forgiving me.// Emily: That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.// Raj: Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.// Emily: Can I ask you one thing?// Raj: Of course. What?// Emily: Did you look in my closet?// Raj: No. Just the drawer.// Emily: You promise you didn’t look in the closet?// Raj: I promise. Why, what’s in there?// Emily: Don’t worry about it. Good night.Series 08 Episode 18 – The Leftover Thermalization// Scene: The lobby.// Sheldon: Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.// Amy: I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t.// Sheldon: Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.// Amy: Oh, let me see.// Sheldon: I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.// Amy: Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all.// Sheldon: Well, that can’t be right.// Amy: It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?// Sheldon: All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.// Amy: Poor Leonard.// Sheldon: Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.// Amy: He might not be.// Sheldon: Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.// Amy: Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?// Sheldon: Oh, I’d be incensed.// Amy: So you see what I’m getting at?// Sheldon: Squeaky wheel gets the grease?// Amy: No.// Sheldon: Grass is always greener?// Amy: Try again.// Sheldon: Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me.// Amy: Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad.// Sheldon: But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.// Amy: Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?// Sheldon: Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.// Amy: Exactly.// Sheldon: For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard’s car.// Howard: Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.// Raj: Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.// Bernadette: Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.// Howard: Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories.// Bernadette: Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?// Howard: Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that.// Leonard: Actually, your name is on the electric bill.// Sheldon: Oh, right. This is a disaster.// Leonard: I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.// Sheldon: Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it.// Leonard: What’s going on?// Sheldon: An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.// Leonard: Did they hate it?// Sheldon: No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it.// Leonard: So what’s the problem?// Sheldon: You know how the PennySaver only has my name…// Leonard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.// Leonard: Really?// Sheldon: I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight.// Leonard: Uh, that, that’s not necessary.// Sheldon: It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.// Leonard: Cooper and his team?// Sheldon: You should know I had nothing to do with that.// Leonard: Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important.// Sheldon: You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.// Leonard: That’s not helping.// Sheldon: Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s House.// Howard: Stuart, we’re here.// Raj: It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.// Howard: Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.// Stuart: Hey. Just so you know, the power’s out.// Bernadette: What happened?// Stuart: I called, they said a transformer blew. It’s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.// Howard: Wait, when did it go out?// Stuart: In the middle of the night.// Howard: Oh, my God.// Bernadette: Howie, what’s wrong?// Howard: It’s all defrosting.// Bernadette: It’s okay. It’s just food.// Howard: It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one.// Raj: Everything okay?// Howard: No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined.// Bernadette: Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?// Raj: You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.// Bernadette: What should we do?// Howard: I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it.// Bernadette: There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.// Howard: All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.// Bernadette: Howie.// Howard: Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time.// Bernadette: I love that.// Raj: Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: I mean, who even reads Scientific American?// Leonard: It’s kind of a big deal.// Penny: If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?// Leonard: Can we please just stop talking about it?// Penny: I’m sorry. What can I do?// Leonard: Nothing, I’m fine.// Penny: No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.// Leonard: What are we doing?// Penny: I am taking you shopping.// Leonard: Oh.// Penny: My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again.// Leonard: Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing.// Penny: Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?// Leonard: Does it have a camera in it?// Penny: It does have a camera in it.// Leonard: Baby’s listening.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.// Leonard: What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?// Sheldon: I did.// Leonard: Thank you. What did he say?// Sheldon: He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.// Leonard: Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.// Penny: You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.// Sheldon: Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.// Penny: You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?// Leonard: If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working.// Sheldon: Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Sheldon: All he had was an idea.// Amy: Well, that is an important part.// Sheldon: Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.// Amy: But Leonard’s idea was good.// Sheldon: Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Leonard: I’m the one who thought of it.// Penny: Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?// Leonard: Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.// Penny: And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.// Sheldon: Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?// Amy: It’s not your fault.// Sheldon: Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?// Amy: Not your fault.// Sheldon: Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?// Amy: Hey, look at that pretty bird.// Leonard: He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.// Penny: I know, I know.// Leonard: I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s kitchen.// Raj: Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.// Bernadette: Thanks.// Howard: Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.// Bernadette: Did she throw anything away?// Howard: No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.// Raj: Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.// Howard: No, that’s noodle kugel.// Raj: One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.// Howard: Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.// Bernadette: You okay?// Howard: Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started.// Raj: You got it.// Howard: I’m never gonna talk to her again.// Bernadette: Should we tell everyone not to come?// Howard: No. I want to do this.// Bernadette: Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can.// Howard: Okay.// Raj: I’m not making any promises.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s living room.// Stuart: Glad you guys could make it.// Leonard: Of course.// Penny: Wow, it looks really pretty in here.// Stuart: Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.// Leonard: So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?// Stuart: And there goes the mood.// Sheldon: Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.// Leonard: Subtle.// Sheldon: But you got it, right?// Howard: Hey, guys.// All: Hey. Hi. Hello.// Howard: I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion.// Bernadette: Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before.// Howard: Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.// Amy: Do you need any help in the kitchen?// Bernadette: No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.// Penny: All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?// Amy: Yes, so please behave yourselves.// Leonard: Fine.// Sheldon: Of course.// Stuart: So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s dining room.// Penny: This food is amazing.// Raj: Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.// Howard: That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here.// Amy: All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.// Sheldon: Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.// Penny: Oh, so it’s like The View.// Amy: Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.// Sheldon: Oh, I’m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek…// Penny: Shut up.// Raj: I would like to propose a salon topic.// Amy: Ooh, please do, Rajesh.// Raj: The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.// Penny: Wait, who’s Tor?// Raj: You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?// Howard: Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.// Stuart: It’s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.// Amy: We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.// Howard: I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.// Penny: Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.// Sheldon: I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.// Leonard: Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?// Bernadette: Oh, that’s fine.// Sheldon: Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.// Amy: Sheldon.// Penny: Guys.// Leonard: No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?// Howard: Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.// Sheldon: Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.// Leonard: Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.// Sheldon: Leonard, please. His mother just died.// Leonard: You’re being ridiculous.// Sheldon: Yeah, so are you.// Penny: Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon.// Sheldon: Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.// Leonard: Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.// Sheldon: Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.// Amy: And girls.// Sheldon: Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.// Leonard: So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?// Sheldon: I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.// Leonard: You want some of this? I’ll give you some.// Bernadette: Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!// Sheldon: She said my name first, that must kill you.// Bernadette (off): I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…// (off)// Howard: You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?// Amy: I don’t hear it.// Raj: No, not at all.// Penny: I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.// Howard: It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.// Sheldon: You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…// Ra: So glad you two are done fighting.// Leonard: Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up.// Sheldon: Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.// Stuart: What’d they say?// Amy: Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?// Sheldon: They did.// All: Yay.// Bernadette: Good news, I found more Tums.Series 08 Episode 19 – The Skywalker Incursion// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Leonard, I’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.// Leonard: Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.// Sheldon: Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I’ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences.// Penny: You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.// Amy: Are you all set for your trip?// Sheldon: Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.// Penny: PRK?// Leonard: Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.// Sheldon: I don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.// Leonard: Keep going.// Sheldon: And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let’s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo.// Penny: You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?// Amy: Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Sheldon: Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can’t Spy? It’s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.// Leonard: If it’s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I’m in.// Sheldon: I’ll begin. Uh, I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.// Leonard: That soy Frappuccino I had.// Sheldon: Will you please play the game? I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.// Leonard: I don’t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?// Sheldon: I don’t want to play anymore.// Leonard: We haven’t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.// Sheldon: We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.// Leonard: No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That’s pretty cool.// Sheldon: I suppose it is. In fact, if you’d like to celebrate with a little music, I’d be okay with that.// Leonard: What? This road trip just got crazy.// Sheldon: Play that funky music, white boy.// Leonard: I’m surprised you know that reference.// Sheldon: What reference?// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Bernadette: So, I put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.// Amy: Can I be in charge of pricing? I’ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?// Howard: All right, Amy’s in charge of pricing and being 75.// Raj: Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?// Penny: Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.// Raj: Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.// Penny: Oh, I meant beer pong.// Amy: I had a table, too, but I didn’t have any friends, so all I did was serve.// Bernadette: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.// Amy: And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.// Howard: Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It’s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.// Bernadette: I think you just answered your own question.// Howard: Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.// Bernadette: Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don’t need to decide this right now.// Howard: Well, I guess as long as you’re keeping an open mind.// Bernadette: Of course.// Scene: Leonard’s car. “Play that funky music, white boy” is playing on the stereo.// Sheldon: So they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: And this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?// Leonard: Sure.// Sheldon: Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?// Leonard: It could be.// Sheldon: So it’s like the musical equivalent of Russell’s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?// Leonard: Exactly.// Sheldon: Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.// Leonard: Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.// Sheldon: Will our hotel room be ready?// Leonard: I doubt it.// Sheldon: Aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?// Leonard: If we do, we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?// Sheldon: Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won’t be very far from Skywalker Ranch.// Leonard: Oh, that’s true. It’s not like we can get in there.// Sheldon: Why not?// Leonard: I don’t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.// Sheldon: Yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That’s code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.// Leonard: We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.// Sheldon: Yes. Oh, I’m so excited. And I just can’t hide it.// Leonard: I’m about to lose control, and I think I like it.// Sheldon: What are you talking about?// Penny: So when do you guys think you’re gonna move in?// Howard: We’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.// Bernadette: It’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.// Amy: Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.// Howard: We’re not selling it, it’s mine.// Bernadette: You can’t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?// Howard: That’s not fair. It’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.// Raj: You could play Ping-Pong for it.// Howard: I would do that.// Bernadette: How is that fair? You grew up with a table.// Howard: Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.// Penny: Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.// Bernadette: Yes, Penny plays for me.// Howard: That’s not fair, she has upper body muscles.// Raj: Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.// Howard: That’s right, okay, Raj can play for me.// Amy: Ooh, you just chose champions. It’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.// Penny: Yeah, it’s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.// Bernadette: Leonard makes you watch that, too?// Penny: No, no, I like that show. It’s got dragons and people doing it.// Howard: So it’s settled. The fate of Doctor Who’s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.// Amy: If you still have that bra, I’ll give you a nickel for it.// Sheldon: There it is. It’s just a gate. On a road.// Leonard: Wasn’t even that hard to find.// Sheldon: This is so amazing.// Leonard: I know. You want to get a picture?// Sheldon: I want more than a picture. I want to go in.// Leonard: Well, so do I, but they’ll never let us.// Sheldon: Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?// Leonard: No, but I don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.// Sheldon: There’s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let’s see what happens.// Leonard: Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I’m a little nervous.// Sheldon: Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.// Leonard: Right.// Sheldon: You pushed it, are you out of your mind?// Voice: May I help you?// Leonard: Um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in.// Sheldon: You’re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.// Voice: Hello? This speaker’s not working, just pull up.// Leonard: And that’s how it’s done.// Scene: The same, further inside the ranch.// Sheldon: All right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.// Leonard: We’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.// Sheldon: I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what’s the plan?// Leonard: Uh, I’m just gonna be honest with the guy.// Sheldon: Honesty will never get us in.// Leonard: Well, what’s your plan?// Sheldon: All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.// Security Guard: Who are you here to see?// Leonard: Uh, I’m just gonna tell you the truth.// Sheldon: Oh, you are killing me.// Leonard: We don’t have an appointment. We, we’re just fans of Mr. Lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.// Security Guard: Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can’t let you in.// Sheldon: What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.// Leonard: I’m sorry, don’t listen to him. We’re actually physicists. We’re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.// Security Guard: Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can’t let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.// Leonard: Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best… What are you doing?// Sheldon: Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.// Security Guard: Don’t move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.// Voice: Copy.// Sheldon: I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. I’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I’m gonna make it. I’m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… Aaaaaaagh!// Howard: Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, ’cause I don’t have a third one. Yes. Woo.// Amy: Rajesh eight, Penny four.// Penny: Sorry, he’s really good.// Bernadette: Hey, Raj. if Howard can’t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?// Raj: What?// Howard: Yeah, what?// Bernadette: I don’t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don’t know much about<i> Doctor Who.// Howard: Don’t listen to her. You and I go way back, we’re like brothers.// Raj: We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.// Amy: Eight-five.// Howard: This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?// Amy: Uh, it, it’s been a long time. I don’t know. I’m probably pretty rusty.// Penny: Wow.// Howard: She’s my champion.// Bernadette: Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.// Penny: Hey.// Bernadette: Oh, come on, like you even care.// Penny: I care. Oh, wait, no, I don’t. Good luck, Raj.// Howard: You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.// Raj: So did I.// Scene: An office in Skywalker Ranch.// Sheldon: Do you think they’re gonna call the police?// Leonard: I don’t know. Maybe they’ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.// Sheldon: Oh, I think that’s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…// Leonard: Oh, shut up.// Nerdy Guy: He’s right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.//  // Leonard: Uh-huh, I’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too.// Sheldon: So, what are you in for?// Nerdy Guy: Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.// Sheldon: But why are you here?// Nerdy Guy: Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.// Sheldon: Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.// Security Guard: All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we’re gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.// Leonard: We understand. Thank you so much.// Nerdy Guy: Uh, what about me?// Security Guard: No, you’re not going anywhere, kissy face. Let’s go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.// Sheldon: Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.// Howard: Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I’ve since turned mean, and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on.// Bernadette: Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn’t that right, Raj?// Raj: Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.// Bernadette: Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.// Raj: Okay, uh, I’m gonna own you, bitch.// Penny: Whoa.// Bernadette: Hey.// Amy: That’s not nice.// Raj: Let’s just play.// Howard: One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?// Bernadette: Don’t listen to him, all she’s got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.// Raj: What, and that’s not offensive? Where’s the line?// Penny: It’s in your purse. Play.// Bernadette: One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.// Howard: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.// Bernadette: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.// Amy: Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.// Howard: It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.// Bernadette: You know, Amy, I, uh, can’t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.// Howard: Don’t listen to her, just hit the ball.// Amy: Keep talking.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Bernadette: If this doesn’t get him into your bedroom, nothing will.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: Are you still mad at me?// Leonard: Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.// Sheldon: Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.// Leonard: The glass is empty, Sheldon. It’s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?// Sheldon: Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you’re looking at this all wrong.// Leonard: Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.// Sheldon: Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.// Leonard: That part was pretty good.// Sheldon: See?// Leonard: You did flop around a lot.// Sheldon: I’ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.// Leonard: You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I’m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.// Sheldon: That’s amazing.// Leonard: I know.// Sheldon: And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?// Leonard: I guess this could count as an adventure.// Sheldon: It was. And even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.// Scene: Amy’s bedroom.// Sheldon: Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.// Amy: Really should have thought this through.Series 08 Episode 20 – The Fortification Implementation// Scene: The cafeteria.// Raj: You’re wrong.// Howard: No, I’m not.// Raj: Yes, you are.// Howard: No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?// Leonard: Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif.// Raj: The guy who invented it says it’s jif.// Howard: I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?// Sheldon: Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated.// Howard: Something happened different from the way you wanted it.// Sheldon: I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included.// Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.// Howard: Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass.// Sheldon: You’re just saying that to make me feel better.// Leonard: Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.// Sheldon: Agreed.// Leonard: I was gonna say or, but why bother?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.// Bernadette: Hey, Raj.// Raj: Hey, I got you a little gift.// Bernadette: Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.// Raj: You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?// Howard: Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is.// Raj: Wow, so you’re not curious at all?// Howard: Nope.// Raj: Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Wil Wheaton: Thanks again for agreeing to do this.// Penny: Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before.// Leonard: Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.// Penny: Those are Star Trek people.// Leonard: Yes.// Penny: I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.// Wil: I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.// Penny: Sorry.// Wil: Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we’re gonna take some calls, we’ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.// Leonard: This is exciting.// Penny: Yeah, so, how many people listen?// Wil: Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.// Penny: What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?// Wil: Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Can you please pass the salt?// Sheldon: Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.// Amy: Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?// Sheldon: I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?// Amy: No, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night.// Amy: According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.// Sheldon: You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.// Amy: Well, it applies to you, too.// Sheldon: I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.// Raj: So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?// Bernadette: You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.// Raj: You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.// Howard: Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down.// Bernadette: Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball.// Howard (answering door): Can I help you?// (answering door)// Guy at door: Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?// Howard: Yes.// Guy: Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.// Howard: Wuh, uh, who’s your father?// Guy: Sam Wolowitz.// Howard: Sam Wolowitz is my father.// Guy: I know.// Howard: Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?// Guy: I think so.// Howard: Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.// Penny: I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.// Wil: Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.// Leonard: Psst.// Wil: I’ve just been handed a note. I’m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.// Leonard: I, I didn’t want to interrupt.// Wil: Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny’s fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don’t you grab some headphones and join us?// Leonard: Really?// Wil: Yeah.// Leonard: Hey, great.// Wil: So, while Leonard gets set up, let’s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.// Caller: I don’t have a question. I just want to say I’m a big fan of the movie. I’ve seen it, like, ten times.// Penny: Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.// Wil: Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.// Penny: Really?// Wil: Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.// Leonard: Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.// Wil: All right, it’s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.// Kevn: Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it’s been, like, two minutes and you haven’t even brought up Stand By Me.// Penny: Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.// Leonard: It really is.// Kevin: Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.// Penny: Oh, wow. I wish it was better.// Wil: Oh, don’t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin’s films?// Kevin: You’re cruisin’ for a beatin’, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.// Penny: Aw.// Wil: You know, I’m in the movie, too.// Kevin: Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you’re not in more stuff, man? I’d cast you in a minute.// Penny: Seriously?// Kevin: Oh, yeah, man. I’m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I’ve ever done before. It’s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.// Penny: Oh, my, I would love that.// Leonard: You have a new job.// Penny: Well, maybe I can do both.// Leonard: I don’t think you can do both.// Penny: I don’t think I asked you.// Kevin: Yeah, you tell him, Penny.// Leonard: Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.// Sheldon: Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?// Amy: Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.// Sheldon: You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb.// Amy: Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.// Sheldon: Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself.// Amy: When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.// Sheldon: I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.// Amy: And at the same time, not.// Sheldon: It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.// Amy: You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.// Sheldon: Isn’t that a little juvenile?// Amy: More juvenile than this?// Sheldon: I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.// Howard: You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.// Bernadette: Oh, let me do it, Howard.// Howard: No, I got it.// Bernadette: So, Josh, what do you do?// Josh: I’m studying oceanography down in San Diego.// Bernadette: Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.// Raj: Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?// Josh: Why would I lie?// Raj: Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?// Josh: No.// Raj: A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?// Raj: You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.// Bernadette: Why don’t you help with the coffee?// Raj: Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?// Howard: Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?// Raj: I get it. What do you want to do?// Howard: I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this.// Raj: All right, I’ve got your back.// Howard: Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.// Josh: I can’t believe my brother’s an astronaut. That’s amazing. What was it like?// Raj: Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road.// Howard: Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.// Wil: So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star…// Leonard: No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.// Wil: All right. We’re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn’t believe women should have dreams.// Leonard: Give me back that juice.// Penny: What is the harm if I audition?// Leonard: Well, what if you get it?// Penny: I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.// Leonard: From a Kevin Smith movie?// Kevin: Oh, I’m hanging up now.// Wil: Don’t you listen to him, buddy. You’re awesome. You’re one of the greatest directors of our time.// Kevin: I don’t have a part for you, Wheaton.// Wil: And that was Kevin Smith.// Penny: Thanks a lot.// Leonard: I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?// Penny: Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?// Leonard: I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.// Penny: Decent? I make twice what you make.// Leonard: Wait, twice?// Penny: Yeah.// Leonard: Like, times two twice?// Wil: For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let’s listen.// Leonard: I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.// Penny: Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.// Leonard: Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?// Wil: For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.// Scene: The apartment. Including fort.// Amy: How’s it going, Sheldon?// Sheldon: Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.// Amy: Can I come in?// Sheldon: Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.// Amy: Amazing.// Sheldon: I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.// Amy: What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.// Sheldon: Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.// Howard: I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?// Josh: Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.// Bernadette: Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?// Josh: Sorry, I have a long drive.// Howard: Well, I hope I get to see you again.// Josh: I hope so, too. I’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.// Bernadette: Keep dreaming.// Howard: Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.// Josh: Wow.// Bernadette: He did it with a robot.// Josh: You had sex with a robot?// Howard: That’s not what she meant.// Raj: But technically, yes.// Leonard: Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?// Penny: In a safe place.// Leonard: What does that mean, under your bed?// Penny: No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.// Leonard: Wait a minute, you have a guy?// Penny: Don’t you have a guy?// Leonard: Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.// Penny: Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.// Wil: For those of you listening at home, how great is this?// Leonard: Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off.// Wil: Sure. And we’re back.// Penny: Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.// Leonard: Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature.// Penny: Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?// Leonard: That would be great, thank you.// Wil: I’m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you’re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?// Leonard: Yes, it is, Wil.// Josh: So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?// Howard: It was actually just a mechanical hand.// Josh: ‘Cause that’s all you need, right?// Howard: You are my brother.// Scene: The fort.// Sheldon: Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.// Amy: I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold.// Sheldon: Mm-hmm.// Amy: And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over.// Sheldon: Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner.// Amy: We both know this one’s gonna win.// Sheldon: Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library.// Amy: Come on, I’ll help you take this down.// Sheldon: Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?// Amy: Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.// Sheldon: That’s a big step.// Amy: It’s a big fort.// Sheldon: Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.// Amy: PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.// Sheldon: G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.// Amy: You got yourself a sleepover.// Sheldon: Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?// Amy: Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?// Sheldon: It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?// Amy: Who says this is the only one I hid?// Leonard: Hello? What is this?// Sheldon: We built a fort.// Leonard: Are those my sheets?// Amy: Yes, they are.// Leonard: Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.// Sheldon: Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?// Leonard: Yeah, I’m good.// Sheldon: Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.// Leonard: Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?// Sheldon: I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here.// Leonard: Thank you.// Amy: Okay, have a seat on the floor.// Sheldon: Not there. That’s my spot.Series 08 Episode 21 – The Communication Deterioration// Scene: The cafeteria.// Sheldon: Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?// Howard: Sure.// Leonard: Really?// Howard: Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.// Sheldon: There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…// Leonard: Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.// Sheldon: Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.// Leonard: That’s pretty cool, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.// Raj: Hey.// Leonard: Hey.// Howard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Raj: You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?// Leonard: Yeah.// Raj: Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.// Leonard: Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.// Sheldon: All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien.// Raj: Anyway, I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.// Sheldon: Excellent.// Howard: Good for you.// Leonard: Congratulations.// Raj: And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.// Leonard: Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?// Sheldon: I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.// Howard: Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.// Sheldon: Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.// Howard: Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?// Raj: Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team.// Leonard: My mommy raised a gentleman.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj: Hey. Thanks for coming by.// Leonard: Yeah. I’m excited to help.// Raj: I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.// Leonard: I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.// Raj: You should have told him to mind his own business.// Leonard: Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda.// Raj: What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?// Leonard: Mmm, they’re alpha males.// Raj: Huh, what does that make us?// Leonard: We could be betas. They’re second in charge.// Raj: Okay, that sounds good.// Leonard: Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.// Raj: Okay, that sounds like us.// Leonard: Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?// Raj: I don’t know. How do you want to start?// Leonard: I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?// Raj: No. We can do this by ourselves.// Leonard: Okay. Great. How do you want to start?// Scene: The hallway.// Penny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Sheldon: I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.// Penny: Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.// Sheldon: I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali.// Penny: Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.// Sheldon: How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.// Penny: No, no. It’s about my acting career.// Sheldon: Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list.// Penny: Well.// Sheldon: Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.// Penny: Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.// Sheldon: Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.// Penny: Well, why?// Sheldon: I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.// Penny: You’re really not gonna tell me?// Sheldon: No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: What’s going on in here?// Howard: I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.// Bernadette: Oh. How do you drink it?// Howard: Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.// Bernadette: I think I’ll have a beer.// Howard: First take a picture with me.// Bernadette: Why?// Howard: Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.// Bernadette: Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?// Howard: You betcha. The very one.// Bernadette: Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together.// Howard: I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you.// Bernadette: Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings.// Howard: With my honeybunch.// Bernadette: You’re being childish.// Howard: No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.// Bernadette: I’m sorry. What do we know?// Howard: In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.// Bernadette: Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?// Howard: You don’t think I’m a leader?// Bernadette: I was kidding. Of course you are.// Howard: Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.// Bernadette: You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?// Howard: All by myself.// Bernadette: There’s my big boss man.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.// Penny: Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.// Sheldon: Mmm.// Penny: If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?// Sheldon: Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?// Penny: No.// Sheldon: All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.// Penny: Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.// Sheldon: Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?// Penny: Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.// Sheldon: No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man.// Penny: I’m sorry. What was I thinking?// Sheldon: Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?// Penny: ‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it.// Sheldon: Ah, it’s just like he’s here.// Raj: Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.// Leonard: Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.// Raj: Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.// Leonard: That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.// Raj: Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.// Leonard: My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.// Raj: And he’s all white.// Leonard: They zip him up in that bag.// Raj: And Gertie can’t stop crying.// Leonard: The flower dies.// Raj: Okay, let’s talk about something else.// Leonard: All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple.// Raj: And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.// Leonard: It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.// Raj: Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.// Leonard: That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.// Raj: Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.// Leonard: Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.// Raj: Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.// Leonard: The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.// Raj: Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.// Leonard: All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.// Raj: We, we can totally do that.// Leonard: I know.// Raj: This is great.// Leonard: Yeah, you know what else it is?// Raj: What?// Howard: Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.// Raj: Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.// Sheldon (singing): It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.// (singing)// Howard: Hang on. Not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?// Sheldon: You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.// Howard: Hello.// Raj: Look, I know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.// Howard: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?// Sheldon: I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.// Leonard: We want you back on the project with us.// Sheldon: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?// Raj: Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help.// Howard: I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.// Raj: It wasn’t, so are you in?// Sheldon: Certainly.// Leonard: Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it.// Sheldon: Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.// Raj: Okay, I think we should do it right now.// Sheldon: Tonight works better for me.// Raj: Okay.// Scene: A hallway.// Penny (voiceover): Okay, it’s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it’s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? (Out loud) I’m starting to remember.// (voiceover)// (Out loud)// Raj: So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.// Sheldon: Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.// Leonard: How is that building on what he just said?// Howard: Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.// Raj: Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.// Sheldon: Building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.// Leonard: Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant.// Howard: I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.// Sheldon: Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out.// Leonard: It’s not Simon Says.// Raj: Yeah, you’re missing the point, Sheldon.// Sheldon: You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?// Scene: The audition room.// Girl: Penny?// Penny: Oh, hey.// Girl: Hey. I haven’t seen you auditioning in a while.// Penny: Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.// Girl: You quit acting?// Penny: Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.// Second Girl: I heard you can make good money doing that.// Penny: Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.// First Girl: Really?// Penny: Mmm.// First Girl: ‘Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.// Audiitoner: Chelsea?// First Girl: Wish me luck.// Second Girl: They’re gonna love you. I heard she’s pushing 40 and everything’s fake.// Penny: Yeah. I started that rumour.// Leonard: Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.// Raj: Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.// Howard: The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.// Sheldon: Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.// Leonard: Squeeze yourself.// Sheldon: Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.// Raj: Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.// Howard: You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.// Raj: Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?// Sheldon: Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.// Raj: Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.// Howard: It’s not always.// Leonard: What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.// Sheldon: We looked great.// Leonard: You let a guy sit on me.// Howard: He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.// Leonard: I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.// Raj: Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.// Howard: You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.// Sheldon: Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing.// Howard: Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.// Sheldon: Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.// Leonard: Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.// Sheldon: I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?// Leonard: Sheldon, you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge.// Sheldon: Leonard, who’s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?// Raj: He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge.// Sheldon: No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.// Amy: I can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.// Penny: I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.// Bernadette: Well, I’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job.// Penny: I do, and you know, I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.// Bernadette: Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard.// Penny: Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life.// Bernadette: You’re welcome. Hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.// Penny: Sure.// Amy: And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.// Penny: Okay.// Bernadette: How about now?// Penny: All right.// Bernadette: Don’t forget your wallet.// Penny: I, uh, huh.// Scene: An alien spacecraft.// Sheldon (on screen): Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can’t miss it.// (on screen)// First Alien: That soft pink alien looks delicious.// Second Alien: I could eat.Series 08 Episode 22 – The Graduation Transmission// Scene: The apartment// Raj: It’s, like, the best one they make, I just can’t get it to work.// Howard: I’ll figure it out.// Raj: It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying.// Howard: Nice. Where were you when I was single?// Leonard: Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?// Penny: Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.// Sheldon: If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed.// Amy: Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?// Leonard: Nope. It’s pretty exciting.// Sheldon: Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?// Leonard: How would I be blinded?// Sheldon: At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.// Leonard: I’ll take my chances.// Sheldon: Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.// Raj: Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?// Howard: Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?// Raj: I don’t know. Why do I own one?// Amy: I think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with Penny.// Leonard: Mm, I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.// Bernadette: Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.// Amy: With a beautiful girl on your arm.// Sheldon: And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The hallway.// Leonard: How’d you get ready so fast?// Penny: Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.// Leonard: Why did you need a belt?// Penny: It’s called an evening look. I’ve never been to New Jersey before.// Leonard: It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.// Penny: So it’s not really like that?// Leonard: No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around.// Penny: You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?// Leonard: Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I’m not doing that either. (Receives text) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled.// (Receives text)// Penny: What?// Leonard: Yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the East Coast.// Penny: Well, can we get on another airline?// Leonard: I don’t think so.// Penny: So, that’s it? We’re not going?// Leonard: I guess not.// Penny: Well, that sucks.// Leonard: Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.// Penny: Oh. You could tell it to me.// Leonard: Oh, thank you, but I’m okay.// Penny: Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.// Leonard: Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.// Penny: Ooh.// Scene: The apartment.// Howard: Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. We should be getting an image.// Sheldon: All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.// Howard: Maybe we should recalibrate it.// Sheldon: All right.// Howard: Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.// Sheldon: It actually says at least?// Howard: Yeah.// Sheldon: Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?// Howard: Sheldon.// Sheldon: You see where I’m going with this.// Howard: Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.// Sheldon: All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter.// Howard: Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.// Sheldon: Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?// Howard: It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.// Sheldon: Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter.// Scene: Raj’s apartment. Skype tone plays.// Raj: Mm. Hello, Daddy. What’s up?// Dr Koothrapalli: Not much, just wanted to see how my son’s doing.// Raj: Very well, thank you.// Dr Koothrapalli: Are you still dating that dermatologist?// Raj: If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask.// Dr Koothrapalli: Oh, and there’s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month’s rent on a toy helicopter?!// Raj: Oh, you’re where that bill goes.// Dr Koothrapalli: I’m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It’s time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.// Raj: No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.// Dr Koothrapalli: No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you’re on your own.// Raj: But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…// Dr Koothrapalli: I’m cutting you off.// Raj: Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?// Howard: No red and yellow, no red and yellow.// Sheldon: Yay.// Howard: It’s green.// Sheldon: We did it. Oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.// Howard: Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.// Sheldon: Oh, no.// Howard: Oh. All right, playtime’s over. Let’s open this baby up.// Sheldon: Won’t that void the warranty?// Howard: Sheldon, I have a master’s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Hey, where’d you go?// Penny: I got you a little something to cheer you up.// Leonard: Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?// Penny: Just open it.// Leonard: A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?// Penny: Because you are giving your commencement speech.// Leonard: What are you talking about?// Penny: I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.// Leonard: Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.// Penny: Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.// Leonard: Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse.// Penny: Yeah.// Howard: Boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces.// Sheldon: You know what they all do, right?// Howard: Yes, of course.// Sheldon: What about this one?// Howard: Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?// Sheldon: Not very.// Howard: That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.// Sheldon: So, can you get it working?// Howard: I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I’ve built components for the space station.// Sheldon: I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.// Howard: It worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.// Raj: Hey, guys.// Howard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Raj: I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?// Sheldon: Well, don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon.// Raj: I don’t freaking believe this.// Howard: Relax, it’ll be fine.// Raj: No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.// Sheldon: You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.// Raj: What?// Sheldon: I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.// Raj: Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.// Howard: Calm down.// Raj: Okay. Okay, you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. (On phone) Hello, Mummy.// (On phone)// Mrs Koothrapalli: Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.// Raj: Well, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?// Mrs Koothrapalli: Such a sweet boy for asking. Can’t believe you come from the poison seed of your father.// Raj: Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.// Mrs Koothrapalli: What does that mean, active social life?// Raj: Well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you.// Mrs Koothrapalli: Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?// Raj: All I know, Mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy.// Mrs Koothrapalli: Well, however much money your father was giving you, I’ll give you more.// Raj: Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.// Penny: What’s taking so long?// Leonard: I don’t think this is gonna work.// Penny: Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.// Leonard: A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.// Penny: Oh. Well, you do.// Leonard: Thank you.// Penny: Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs.// Leonard: Well, I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.// Penny: Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice.// Leonard: Oh. Done and done.// Howard: Okay, I think I’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.// Sheldon: Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore.// Howard: One toy at a time.// Sheldon: Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.// Raj: What’s the first one?// Howard: Suicide.// Sheldon: Wrong. Obesity.// Bernadette: I have the tool you wanted.// Howard: Thank you.// Raj: You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.// Howard: It’s not about the money. It’s about solving a problem. It’s why I became an engineer. It’s what I like to do, it’s what I’m trained to do. It’s who I am.// Sheldon: Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.// Bernadette: Why don’t you just call tech support?// Sheldon: Whoa.// Raj: Not cool.// Bernadette: What?// Howard: There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.// Bernadette: I call tech support all the time.// Howard: Ha-ha.// Sheldon: You call tech support.// Raj: What a baby.// Scene: Leonard’s old school.// Headmaster: And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.// Leonard (on screen): Members of the faculty, students, I’m excited to speak to you today. I can’t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.// (on screen)// Penny: Oh. Hello. I, I didn’t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don’t do drugs and stay in school.// Leonard: They’re graduating.// Penny: Okay, bye.// Howard: All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we’re back in business. Let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?// Sheldon: Check.// Howard: GPS?// Raj: Check.// Howard: Battery charged?// Bernadette: Four hours of our lives gone? Check.// Howard: All right. All systems go. In five…// Together: Four, three, two, one.// Sheldon: That’s what my train used to do.// Bernadette: Ready to call tech support?// Howard: Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual I have. (Raj’s phone rings)// (Raj’s phone rings)// Raj: It’s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.// Dr Koothrapalli: What did you say to your mother?// Raj: Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay.// Dr Koothrapalli: Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I’m some sort of playboy.// Raj: Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you.// Dr Koothrapalli: You think you take after me?// Raj: Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model. (Re-entering apartment) Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?// (Re-entering apartment)// Leonard (on screen): It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I’m boring myself. Sorry, I can’t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but I didn’t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don’t have any friends. And guess what? That’s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don’t know what they were doing ’cause I was never there.// Penny: I’ll, I’ll tell you later.// Leonard: My point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.// Tech Support Voice: Your call is important to us. All our technicians are busy helping other customers. Please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly.// Howard: What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.// Sheldon: It is awful, isn’t it? Listen to that noise.// Howard: Hang on, hang on. It’s working. I did it.// Raj: How’d you do that?// Howard: No idea, but I did it.// Bernadette: Maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside.// Howard: Well, I’m not flying it.// Sheldon: Then who is?// Howard: I don’t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.// Sheldon: Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera’s working. Oh, look, it’s me.// Tech Support Guy: Tech Support, can I help you?// Sheldon: Yes, it’s a robot uprising. Call the police.// Leonard: So you really think they liked it?// Penny: Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I…// Sheldon: Don’t worry, everyone in here is safe.Series 08 Episode 23 – The Maternal Combustion// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?// Leonard: I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning.// Penny: Don’t you want to know for sure?// Leonard: No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.// Amy: It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.// Sheldon: Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?// Penny: Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it.// Amy: Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.// Sheldon: You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.// Amy: He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.// Penny: You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.// Leonard: If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.// Penny: Really? It didn’t work for you.// Amy: Do you think the moms will get along?// Leonard: Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.// Sheldon: Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?// Credits sequence.// Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.// Sheldon: Oh, thank you, Mother.// Mrs Cooper: I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.// Sheldon: Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.// Mrs Cooper: Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.// Sheldon: What did they feed the lions, Mother?// Mrs Cooper: The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.// Sheldon: Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?// Mrs Cooper: Are you ashamed of me?// Sheldon: Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.// Mrs Cooper: Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.// Scene: The stairwell.// Dr Hofstadter: So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?// Leonard: No, we’re kind of taking it slow.// Dr Hofstadter: I see.// Leonard: What does that mean?// Dr Hofstadter: You’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there’s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?// Leonard: Yes, Mother.// Dr Hofstadter: Only satisfactory. I see.// Leonard: I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.// Dr Hofstadter: Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.// Leonard: See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?// Dr Hofstadter: Why? Are you attracted to her, too?// Leonard: Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.// Dr Hofstadter: Leonard, I’m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.// Leonard: Thank you.// Dr Hofstadter: Where is she from again?// Leonard: East Texas.// Dr Hofstadter: Ugh.// Leonard: Hey, look who’s here.// Sheldon: Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again.// Dr Hofstadter: Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.// Sheldon: Oh, thank you.// Leonard: We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?// Dr Hofstadter: Of course I did, but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval.// Leonard: That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.// Sheldon: Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.// Dr Hofstadter: : So nice to meet you.// Mrs Cooper: Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?// Dr Hofstadter: Very pleasant. And yours?// Mrs Cooper: Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.// Dr Hofstadter: You’re kidding, right?// Leonard: Subtle, mom, real subtle.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: Stuart.// Stuart: Morning.// Bernadette: We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.// Howard: Hey.// Mrs Cooper: You must be very proud of your son.// Dr Hofstadter: Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.// Mrs Cooper: He did?// Dr Hofstadter: Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he’s terrific.// Sheldon: Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?// Leonard: You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.// Dr Hofstadter: Calm down, dear. Mary, I’m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?// Sheldon: Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.// Mrs Cooper: Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.// Sheldon: Ooh, this is a good one.// Mrs Cooper: Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.// Sheldon: Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.// Sheldon: But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.// Mrs Cooper: No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.// Dr Hofstadter: Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, he was a handful.// Sheldon: I was a handful.// Leonard: You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.// Dr Hofstadter: All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.// Howard: I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.// Raj: We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.// Stuart: Clearly, you’ve never seen me try to talk to a woman.// Bernadette: Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.// Stuart: I put on pants.// Howard: Kiss-ass.// Bernadette: Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.// Raj: Hey, I don’t even live here.// Bernadette: Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?// Raj: I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible.// Sheldon: Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.// Dr Hofstadter: You don’t look very happy.// Sheldon: Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.// Mrs Cooper: Shelly does not like change.// Sheldon: Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.// Penny: Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.// Dr Hofstadter: Hello. Oh, okay.// Penny: Sorry, I forgot.// Sheldon: You remember my mother.// Penny: Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.// Mrs Cooper: Good to see you again, dear.// Penny: Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about.// Leonard: So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged.// Penny: Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.// Dr Hofstadter: Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.// Sheldon: Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.// Leonard: We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?// Sheldon: Oh, sure.// Leonard: It came from Tiffany’s.// Sheldon: You mean the box, right?// Leonard: Keep walking.// Penny: Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.// Sheldon: Did I misspeak about the ring?// Leonard: Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.// Sheldon: Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?// Leonard: Yes, you are a super weaner.// Sheldon: Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.// Leonard: Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.// Sheldon: Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.// Penny: We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.// Mrs Cooper: It doesn’t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.// Dr Hofstadter: Uch.// Mrs Cooper: Uch? The bible is uch to you?// Dr Hofstadter: No, I’m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people’s superstitions can be to them.// Mrs Cooper: You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?// Dr Hofstadter: His name is Sigmund Freud.// Penny: Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.// Mrs Cooper: Stay out of this.// Penny: Mm-hmm.// Mrs Cooper: At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.// Dr Hofstadter: It’s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?// Mrs Cooper: I know the answer. You’re not gonna like it.// Dr Hofstadter: Try me.// Mrs Cooper: When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?// Dr Hofstadter: : It means, I can’t believe we’re having this conversation.// Mrs Cooper: Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.// Penny: Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.// Sheldon: It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.// Leonard: Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.// Raj: How old is this Jell-O?// Stuart: Well, it’s carrots, so gonna say very.// Howard: Sorry we have to do this.// Stuart: Bernadette’s not wrong. She does work hard around here.// Raj: Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.// Howard: She doesn’t baby me.// Stuart: I saw her pull you home in a wagon.// Howard: For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.// Raj: Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.// Howard: You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.// Scene: A coffee shop.// Dr Hofstadter: I’m terribly sorry that I upset your mother.// Sheldon: Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.// Dr Hofstadter: I can’t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.// Sheldon: Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.// Dr Hofstadter: But look how well you turned out.// Sheldon: I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.// Dr Hofstadter: I suppose.// Sheldon: While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.// Dr Hofstadter: Do you suppose you would’ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?// Sheldon: Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?// Leonard: Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, I’m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.// Penny: Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love.// Penny: Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.// Leonard: That’s not what it is.// Penny: I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.// Mrs Cooper: When your mom gets back, I’m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.// Penny: Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.// Mrs Cooper: Doesn’t matter, a good Christian would’ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would’ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?// Leonard: Oh, me.// Penny: Yeah, me, too.// Mrs Cooper: Coming up.// Leonard: I don’t really feel I deserve it.// Howard: That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.// Raj: Looks good.// Stuart: Yeah.// Bernadette: Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.// Howard: Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.// Mrs Cooper: I’m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.// Dr Hofstadter: Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.// Mrs Cooper: And I will pray for you.// Leonard: Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.// Dr Hofstadter: One moment. There’s something I need to say to you.// Leonard: Oh, really? That’s too bad.// Dr Hofstadter: Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child.// Sheldon: I taught her that.// Dr Hofstadter: Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.// Leonard: Wow. When does that start?// Dr Hofstadter: So needy. Come to Mommy.// Penny: It’s okay, go ahead.// Dr Hofstadter: Oh, my son.// Leonard: Oh, my mother.// Penny: Oh, my God.// Stuart (singing): It’s a hard-knock life.// (singing):// Together (singing): It’s the hard-knock life for us, it’s the hard-knock life for us. ‘Stead of treated, we get tricked, ‘stead of kisses, we get kicked, it’s the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it’s the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets ‘stead of wool, empty bellies ‘stead of full, it’s a hard-knock life.// (singing)Series 08 Episode 24 – The Commitment Determination// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?// Sheldon: I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?// Amy: That’s what you’re thinking about?// Sheldon: Well, one of the things.// Amy: Are any of them me?// Sheldon: Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.// Amy: What are you doing?// Sheldon: You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood.// Amy: I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.// Sheldon: Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.// Amy: Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?// Sheldon: Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.// Amy: Oh, sure, I’d love to.// Sheldon: Whenever you’re ready.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The comic book store.// Stuart: I don’t want to rush you, but I’m closing a little early tonight.// Raj: Ooh. Hot date?// Stuart: Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don’t have to not ask me twice.// Emily: If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?// Raj: You’re kidding, right?// Emily: Oh. Is this freaking you out?// Raj: I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.// Emily: All right. Never mind.// Raj: No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you.// Stuart: Sold.// Emily: Raj, you don’t have to do that.// Stuart: Too late. No returns.// Scene: The stairwell.// Leonard: That was really intense.// Penny: Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.// Leonard: Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?// Sheldon: What happened?// Penny: Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.// Sheldon: Been there.// Penny: Mmm. So what do you need help with?// Sheldon: Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why.// Penny: Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?// Sheldon: Yes.// Penny: That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?// Sheldon: Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.// Penny: And that made her angry?// Sheldon: Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.// Penny: Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.// Sheldon: It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.// Penny: Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?// Leonard: I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.// Sheldon: Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.// Leonard: I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.// Sheldon: Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.// Penny: Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.// Sheldon: Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.// Penny: Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.// Sheldon: If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Raj: You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?// Bernadette: You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?// Raj: No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.// Howard: One more time?// Raj: She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.// Howard: Like, a random person or somebody she knew?// Raj: What difference does it make?// Howard: Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.// Bernadette: The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it.// Raj: Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?// Bernadette: Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.// Raj: I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.// Howard: Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?// Bernadette: I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.// Howard: How are you saying that with a straight face?// Bernadette: I don’t know.// Raj: You guys are being jerks.// Howard: Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life.// Raj: You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.// Howard: That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for.// Raj: Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.// Bernadette: That’s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.// Penny: Thanks for cooking.// Leonard: Mmm. My pleasure.// Penny: That carrot was delicious.// Leonard: Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.// Penny: Still haven’t heard from her?// Sheldon: No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.// Penny: Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.// Sheldon: Too slow?// Penny: Yeah, you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together.// Sheldon: That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.// Penny: Uh, hello.// Sheldon: Hello.// Penny: No. Sheldon, we’re getting married.// Sheldon: But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date.// Penny: Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush.// Sheldon: Okay.// Leonard: We’re gonna set a date.// Sheldon: Okay. If you say so.// Penny: Yeah, it’s just, things are good right now.// Leonard: Really good.// Penny: I’m focusing on my job.// Leonard: And we’ve been busy with our paper.// Penny: So busy.// Leonard: Yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date.// Penny: Yeah.// Penny: You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you.// Sheldon: Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.// Bernadette: Did you eat all my yoghurt?// Howard: You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?// Bernadette: You know which yoghurt I mean.// Howard: I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart.// Bernadette: Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.// Howard: We should have done it months ago.// Bernadette: I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.// Howard: Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that.// Bernadette: All right. Tonight’s the night.// Howard: Agreed. When he gets home, I’m dropping the hammer.// Bernadette: Ooh, I like when you take charge.// Howard: Oh, I’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer.// Leonard: So, why haven’t we picked a date?// Penny: You know why.// Leonard: Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?// Penny: Not in a rush, busy with work…// Sheldon: Things are good right now.// Penny: Really good.// Leonard: You still want to get married, right?// Penny: Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?// Leonard: I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?// Penny: Well, you want a date, pick a date.// Leonard: It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?// Sheldon: Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.// Penny: Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?// Leonard: Is your dad paying for it?// Penny: I doubt it.// Leonard: Okay, two friends each.// Penny: All right, well, I want it in a church.// Leonard: Fine. I want black-tie.// Penny: Fine. I want to release butterflies.// Sheldon: Seriously? Airborne worms?// Leonard: Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.// Penny: Sounds perfect.// Leonard: Great.// Sheldon: You still didn’t pick a date.// Penny: Stay out of it.// Leonard: Shut up.// Scene: A graveyard.// Emily: Mmm. It’s a beautiful night.// Raj: Oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.// Emily: Makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?// Raj: So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.// Emily: You aren’t scared, are you?// Raj: Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.// Sheldon: I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.// Penny: No, it’s okay.// Leonard: Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.// Sheldon: Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?// Penny: Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now.// Sheldon: Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?// Penny: Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.// Sheldon: So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?// Leonard: Sheldon, I’m not a whiner.// Sheldon: It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.// Leonard: Look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.// Penny: Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross.// Leonard: Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together.// Sheldon: My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.// Penny: Um, I’m free tonight.// Leonard: Are you saying you want to get married?// Penny: Vegas isn’t that far away.// Leonard: I’m in. Let’s do it.// Sheldon: After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.// Penny: Oh, thank you.// Leonard: Thanks.// Sheldon: Now get out of my spot.// Howard: Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.// Bernadette: Right.// Howard: Good luck.// Bernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.// Howard: Never should have told you my middle name.// Stuart: Hey, guys.// Howard: Hey, you got a minute?// Stuart: Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.// Bernadette: Don’t let that sway you.// Howard: It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.// Stuart: What’s up?// Bernadette: So, we need to talk.// Scene: The graveyard.// Emily: You okay?// Raj: I think we should talk.// Stuart: Is everything okay?// Bernadette: Well, you’ve been living here a while now.// Stuart: I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.// Bernadette: Yeah.// Howard: His middle name is David. Go.// Raj: Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.// Emily: Are you breaking up with me?// Raj: No, no, I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside.// Bernadette: So, anyway, what I’m trying to say is… (phone rings)// (phone rings)// Howard: You need to take that?// Stuart: It’s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I’ll call him back. You were saying?// Emily: Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don’t expect me to do it for you.// Raj: End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.// Howard and Bernadette (singing): Happy birthday to you.// (singing)// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Penny: Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.// Leonard: Doesn’t sound very romantic.// Penny: Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.// Leonard: I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.// Penny: Yeah. This is crazy.// Leonard: I know. You think people are gonna be mad?// Penny: Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.// Leonard: It is. It is about us.// Penny: And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.// Leonard: Right. No surprises.// Penny: And no regrets.// Leonard: Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you.// Penny: What?// Leonard: You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.// Leonard: Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?// Leonard: Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.// Penny: No, you told me.// Leonard: Okay, um, well, there was this girl.// Penny: What did you do?// Leonard: Nothing really. It was just kissing.// Penny: And then what?// Leonard: And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.// Penny: All right.// Leonard: Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?// Penny: Nope, never.// Leonard: Oh, that’s too bad.// Penny: You know, can I ask you a question?// Leonard: Hmm?// Penny: Why are you telling me this now?// Leonard: Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.// Penny: Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.// Leonard: Would you rather I didn’t tell you?// Penny: No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.// Leonard: See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?// Penny: Uh, keep your mouth off other women.// Leonard: I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.// Penny: Okay.// Leonard: Yeah?// Penny: Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.// Leonard: Right.// Penny: Just kissing.// Leonard: It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick.// Penny: Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking.// Leonard: So, we’re still getting married?// Penny: Yes.// Leonard: Because we love each other.// Leonard: And it’s the happiest day of our lives.// Penny: Ha-ha, don’t push it.// Amy (on skype): Hello.// (on skype)// Sheldon: Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…// Amy: I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years.// Sheldon: Strongly disagree. Go on.// Amy: Okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.// Sheldon: Oh.// Amy: I hope you understand.// Amy: Bye, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Well, Gollum, you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?"
9,"Series 09 Episode 01 – The Matrimonial Momentum// Following a “previously on” sequence.// Scene: A Wedding Chapel.// Penny: So, what package are you thinking?// Leonard: Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.// Penny: Why would we want that?// Leonard: ‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope.// Penny: Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.// Leonard: If you’re not into this, we can do it another time.// Penny: No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it.// Leonard: Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. (Phone) Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.// (Phone)// Sheldon: Leonard, have you gotten married yet?// Leonard: No. Why?// Sheldon: Good. Don’t do it.// Leonard: Why not?// Sheldon: Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.// Leonard: What happened now?// Sheldon: Amy has ended our relationship.// Leonard: Oh, no. Seriously?// Penny: What’s going on?// Leonard: Amy broke up with Sheldon.// Penny: She did?// Sheldon: Is Penny crying?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.// Leonard: Buddy, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?// Sheldon: Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.// Leonard: Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad.// Sheldon: Whatever.// Penny (on phone): Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?// (on phone)// Amy: Not really. Can you come over?// Penny: Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.// Amy: Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?// Penny: Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.// Amy: Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.// Penny: Amy, don’t be like that.// Sheldon: Why did I just hear Amy’s name?// Leonard: Penny’s on the phone with her.// Sheldon: Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care.// Penny: Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.// Sheldon: Amy’s upset? Is it about me?// Leonard: No, I think it’s because we’re eloping.// Sheldon: Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Outside Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: Hello.// Amy: Oh. What are you doing here?// Sheldon: When last we spoke, you said you needed time.// Amy: Well, it’s only been 11 hours.// Sheldon: The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.// Amy: Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know.// Sheldon: Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?// Amy: Sure.// Sheldon: Boy, I’m glad we’re going out again.// Amy: We’re not back together.// Sheldon: Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?// Amy: If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding.// Sheldon: And who’s this guy you’re taking?// Amy: There’s no guy.// Sheldon: Oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad.// Amy: I’m not gonna be alone. I’ll be with my friends.// Sheldon: Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?// Amy: Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.// Sheldon: We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing.// Scene: The Wedding Chapel.// Leonard: They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.// Penny: Okay.// Leonard: Hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.// Penny: Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.// Leonard: I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it’s not how I pictured it either, but I’m still glad we’re doing it.// Penny: Me, too.// Leonard: You sure?// Penny: Yes.// Leonard: And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?// Penny: Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?// Leonard: You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?// Penny: What if they call our names?// Leonard: Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.// Penny: Oh, and the fairy tale continues.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s House.// Amy: Thank you for doing this.// Bernadette: Our pleasure. You feeling okay?// Amy: We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling.// Howard: Well, that’s understandable. You forgot. It’s called happy.// Bernadette: Howard.// Howard: I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.// Stuart: I know what you’re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.// Amy: Oh. What was her name?// Stuart: Hey, it’s a true story. I don’t need the third degree.// Bernadette: For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?// Sheldon: I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom.// Bernadette: Howard, do something.// Howard: I’m on it.// Amy: Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.// Sheldon: I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?// Amy: They didn’t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.// Raj: Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?// Official: So, when you hear the music, that’s your cue. Any questions?// Leonard: Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.// Official: Where are the rose petals?!// Female Voice We’re out// Leonard: You know what? It’s fine.// Female Voice: We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!// Penny: Really, we’re good.// Leonard: Yup, just want to get married.// Penny: Yeah.// Official: Great. I’ll see you two up there.// Leonard: This is it.// Penny: I know.// Leonard: I love you.// Penny: I love you, too.// Female Voice: Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?// Penny: No, thank you.// Leonard: We’re good.// Sheldon: Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another.// Raj: Didn’t even crack the top ten.// Sheldon: Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.// Amy: I said I needed time to think.// Raj: I’m sure you guys will figure something out.// Sheldon: You hear that? Raj is devastated.// Bernadette: Sheldon, shh. The wedding’s starting.// Sheldon: I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team, I pick Howard.// Howard: I’m not taking sides.// Sheldon: Fine, I guess I’m stuck with Raj.// Raj: Really?// Stuart: At least you got picked.// Official: Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?// Leonard: Yes.// Penny: No. You wrote vows?// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny: Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad.// Leonard: It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.// Penny: No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this.// Leonard: Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.// Penny: Wow.// Official: Penny?// Penny: Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.// Official: Is that the song from Toy Story?// Penny: He loves that movie.// Leonard: I do.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: Aw, that was beautiful.// Howard: Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.// Bernadette: No, we totally won.// Sheldon: Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind.// Amy: It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.// Sheldon: Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.// Amy: You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up.// Bernadette: Amy.// Sheldon: Will someone take me home?// Raj: Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride.// Official (voice from computer) …symbolizes your eternal love. I now pronounce you husband and wife.// (voice from computer)// Penny: We did it.// Leonard: Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch.// Howard: We’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.// Scene: Hotel corridor.// Leonard: No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold.// Penny: Can you?// Leonard: Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?// Penny: Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?// Leonard: I’m okay.// Penny: Nicely done.// Leonard: Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me.// Penny: Well, the night is still young.// Leonard: Everything all right?// Penny: Yeah. I guess.// Leonard: Just tell me.// Penny: It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl.// Leonard: Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.// Penny: You’re right. Just forget it.// Leonard: Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.// Penny: Did you feel guilty?// Leonard: No, she had dental insurance.// Penny: Did you feel guilty after kissing her?// Leonard: Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.// Penny: What do you mean, every time you see her?// Leonard: What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie.// Penny: You still see her?// Leonard: Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.// Penny: You work with her? How could you not tell me that?// Leonard: I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking// Penny: Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?// Leonard: No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon (on phone): Hello, Mother.// Mrs Cooper: Shelly! How’s my baby doing?// Sheldon: I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, what’s going on?// Sheldon: She broke up with me.// Mrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly.// Sheldon: No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you.// Mrs Cooper: Well, let’s not be hasty. Are you sure it’s over for good?// Sheldon: It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.// Mrs Cooper: You want to tell me what happened?// Sheldon: Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?// Mrs Cooper: Good chance.// Sheldon: Then no, thank you.// Mrs Cooper: Well, honey, don’t send it back yet. Your sister’s married, and I’m not letting your brother give my grandmother’s ring to that whore he’s dating.// Sheldon: Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?// Mrs Cooper: When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.// Bernadette: I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better.// Amy: Yeah.// Howard: Everything’s gonna be okay.// Stuart: You’ve got so much to offer.// Amy: Thank you.// Stuart: Any man would be lucky to have you.// Bernadette: That’s true.// Amy: I just hope I did the right thing.// Stuart: I’m sure you did. Maybe that’s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it’s time to do the wrong thing.// Amy: Like you’re doing right now?// Stuart: Exactly.// Scene: The stairwell.// Leonard: I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?// Penny: I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m not.// Leonard: Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.// Sheldon: Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.// Leonard: I’m not glowing. I’m upset.// Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Sheldon (outside): Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?// (outside)// Penny: What’s this?// Sheldon: Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.// Penny: Oh. That’s so sweet of you.// Sheldon: Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.// Penny: I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.// Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.// Penny: You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.// Sheldon: He does? Who is it?// Penny: Some girl named Mandy.// Sheldon: Mandy Chao?// Sheldon: Oh, you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better// than Leonard.// Penny: That’s great.// Sheldon: Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I’m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.// Penny: That’s ridiculous.// Sheldon: Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard.// Penny: I’m with Leonard.// Sheldon: Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?// Penny: Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.// Sheldon: Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?// Penny: I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.// Sheldon: Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?// Penny: Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.// Sheldon: I see. Well, I think I’ll be going.// Penny: Sheldon.// Sheldon: No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?// Penny: Sure.// Sheldon: Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.// Howard (on phone): All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.// Bernadette: What happened? They just got married.// Howard: I don’t know. It’s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.// Bernadette: Think they’ll break up?// Howard: I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.// Stuart: Really?// Sheldon: Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?// Leonard: Sure, let’s make it an even hundred.// Sheldon: You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.// Leonard: I wouldn’t.// Sheldon: And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.// Leonard: Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.// Leonard: I figured that out.// Sheldon: You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.// Leonard: Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.// Sheldon: Really? I never imagined it any other way.//  Series 09 Episode 02 – The Separation Oscillation// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Why are you up?// Leonard: How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me.// Sheldon: Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.// Penny (entering): Hi.// (entering)// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: You couldn’t sleep either?// Leonard: Of course not.// Sheldon: Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.// Leonard: What are we gonna do?// Penny: I don’t know.// Leonard: Please, tell me how I can fix it.// Sheldon: Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.// Leonard: Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.// Penny: Actually, I think he’s onto something.// Leonard: You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?// Sheldon: I’m currently single.// Penny: That’s true. You are.// Leonard: What is happening?// Sheldon: I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.// Leonard (waking up): U-u-u-uh!// (waking up)// Credits sequence.// Amy (on skype): Sheldon, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.// (on skype)// Sheldon: Well, hello to you, too.// Amy: What do you want?// Sheldon: I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.// Amy: What baby?// Sheldon: A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.// Amy: I’m hanging up.// Sheldon: Great. See you in about half an hour.// Amy: Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.// Sheldon: Why not?// Amy: Because we’re broken up.// Sheldon: Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.// Amy: No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher.// Sheldon: You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.// Amy: Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it’s hard. It’s hard for me, too. But I’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.// Sheldon: Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.// Scene: The Comic Book Store.// Raj: I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.// Leonard: Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.// Raj: And you knew about this this whole time?// Howard: I did.// Raj: And you didn’t think to tell me?// Howard: Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.// Raj: Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.// Leonard: Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?// Raj: Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?// Howard: You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two.// Raj: I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.// Leonard: Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.// Raj: Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.// Scene: Amy’s apartment. Sheldon knocks three times.// Amy: What are you doing here?// Sheldon: I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.// Amy: And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.// Sheldon: On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.// Amy: Just give me the box.// Sheldon: Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?// Amy: Fine. My old scarf.// Sheldon: You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?// Amy: You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?// Sheldon: We made one heck of a team, huh?// Amy: Whose bra is this?// Sheldon: It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.// Amy: It’s Penny’s.// Sheldon: Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.// Amy: Good-bye.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: Ooh, brownies for girls’ night!// Bernadette: Hands off. I’m mad at you.// Howard: Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself.// Bernadette: What will pay for itself?// Howard: Doesn’t matter. What are you mad about?// Bernadette: I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.// Howard: And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don’t even look at it.// Bernadette: I mean, if Penny finds out I’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think I’m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.// Howard: And I wish Leonard never told me. He’s the bad guy here.// Bernadette: I guess that’s true.// Howard: And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?// Leonard (on phone): Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here.// (on phone)// Leonard: Call you back. Hey.// Penny: Can we talk?// Leonard: I would love that.// Penny: All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this, but I don’t know what to do.// Leonard: If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.// Sheldon (entering): Hello.// Leonard: Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?// Sheldon: Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.// Penny: Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more information.// Sheldon: Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.// Penny: Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?// Sheldon: Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution.// Leonard: Wake up, wake up, wake up.// Sheldon: Bring Penny to meet Mandy.// Leonard: What? Why?// Sheldon: Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.// Leonard: Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.// Sheldon: And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.// Leonard: Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.// Penny: Really? Why is that?// Leonard: What, you actually want to meet her?// Penny: No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe I should.// Leonard: I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?// Sheldon: Yes. And that’s coming from me.// Leonard: Fine, you want to meet her?// Penny: No, I just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on.// Leonard: How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.// Penny: Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.// Sheldon: In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.// Amy: Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.// Penny: What do you think?// Bernadette: I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.// Penny: You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met.// Amy: Come on, you know Leonard’s not like that.// Penny: I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?// Bernadette: Oh, I don’t know. This is all so new to me. I’m still processing.// Penny: You know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now.// Amy: That’s because you made him more confident.// Bernadette: You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice.// Penny: I never thought about it like that.// Bernadette: Oh, me neither, not until just now.// Sheldon: Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I’m holding a remote control. That’s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I’m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. We’re here to talk about flags. Tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Leonard: You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?// Howard: 250 dollars an hour. Why?// Raj: How do you know?// Howard: Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.// Raj: And I’m just hearing about this now?// Howard: Dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.// Raj: You don’t have to, you should want to.// Leonard: Oh, great, there’s Mandy.// Howard: Why are marine biologists always so cute?// Raj: I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.// Leonard: That’s not helpful.// Howard: Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.// Leonard: Are we done?// Raj: Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?// Leonard: I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.// Howard: Leonard, wait.// Leonard: What?// Howard: I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.// Raj: Now we are done.// Mandy: Oh, hi, Leonard. What’s up?// Leonard: Uh, do you mind if I sit?// Mandy: Sure.// Leonard: So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.// Mandy: What about it?// Leonard: You know, what we did, when we were drunk.// Mandy: Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?// Leonard: No, we just made out.// Mandy: Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?// Leonard: Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.// Mandy: Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?// Leonard: Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work.// Mandy: It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?// Leonard: Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.// Mandy: Is that really the reason?// Leonard: What else would it be?// Mandy: I don’t know. Sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship.// Leonard: No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.// Mandy: Okay, well, that’s something to think about.// Leonard: You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.// Mandy: Oh, you’re gonna think about that right here?// Leonard: I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.// Mandy: Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.// Leonard: Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me.// Mandy: Imagine that.// Leonard: I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.// Mandy: And your wife is worried about me?// Raj: Hey, Leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more.// Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is watching Fun With Flags.// Sheldon (on screen): And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.// (on screen)// Amy: I’m gonna kill him.// Sheldon: But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?// Penny: So, you said you had something to tell me.// Leonard: Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?// Penny: Uh-huh.// Leonard: I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.// Penny: I’m listening.// Leonard: Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you.// Penny: Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.// Leonard: You do?// Penny: Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.// Leonard: I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?// Penny: You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.// Leonard: Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?// Penny: That sounds nice.// Leonard: Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.// Penny: Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.// Leonard: Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.// Penny: It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.// Leonard: Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?// Penny: Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?// Leonard: Yes, please.// Penny: Okay.// Penny: Sheldon, I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift.// Sheldon: I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.// Leonard: What is this?// Sheldon: Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.// Penny: Oh.// Leonard: Wow.// Penny: That’s so great.// Sheldon: Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun.// Penny: We?// Sheldon: Is there a problem?// Penny: Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.// Amy (at door): How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?// (at door)// Sheldon: You saw through that one, did you?// Amy: I don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.// Sheldon: She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back.// Amy: I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.// Sheldon: She was listening through the door. She wants me.Series 09 Episode 03 – The Batchelor Party Corrosion// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Would you pass the mustard?// Leonard: Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?// Sheldon: Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.// Raj (entering with Howard): Hey, there.// (entering with Howard)// Leonard: Hey, you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour.// Howard: Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.// Leonard: What are you talking about?// Raj: Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.// Sheldon: Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?// Leonard: When do we leave?// Howard: Right now.// Raj: Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.// Howard: Wow, okay.// Sheldon: You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?// Raj: Oh, not just him, you’re coming, too.// Sheldon: Oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?// Scene: Outside, by a van.// Sheldon: Unhand me. This is ridiculous.// Howard: I told you to put tape on his mouth.// Raj: And I told you he bit me.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The van.// Sheldon: It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.// Howard: Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting.// Sheldon: It runs on syphilis?// Raj: This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.// Sheldon: No.// Howard: Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.// Leonard: This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool.// Raj: Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it.// Howard: I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.// Sheldon: Yeah, and talked about physics with them.// Leonard: So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?// Raj: Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.// Leonard: India.// Raj: We can drive there.// Leonard: Your house?// Howard: We are going to Me-hi-co.// Leonard: Fun, I’ve never been there.// Sheldon: Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.// Raj: What’s wrong with Mexico?// Sheldon: Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside.// Howard: Okay, calm down. There’s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.// Sheldon: Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?// Penny: Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower.// Amy (entering): Hi.// (entering)// Penny: Hey.// Amy: I know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.// Penny: You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.// Amy: Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.// Bernadette: Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.// Amy: I had extra dough.// Penny (reading text): Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the border.// (reading text)// Bernadette: I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico.// Penny: Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.// Amy: Boy, that was a long night for me.// Sheldon: Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.// Raj: We don’t have any of those.// Sheldon: How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.// Leonard: If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?// Sheldon: Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?// Howard: You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.// Sheldon: You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.// Amy: So, Penny, how’s married life?// Penny: Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.// Bernadette: You guys still aren’t living together?// Penny: We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.// Bernadette: Speaking of Sheldon, how’s single life treating you?// Amy: Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.// Penny: Yes.// Bernadette: Good for you.// Amy: But then I decided I don’t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.// Penny: You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.// Amy: Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.// Bernadette: Your sweater?// Penny: Your glasses?// Bernadette: Your hair?// Penny: Your shoes.// Amy: Piercing my ears.// Penny: Oh.// Bernadette: You really never had that done?// Amy: My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.// Penny: Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now.// Amy: I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a Klingon.// Bernadette: We’ll take you to the mall to get it done.// Penny: Why? I can do it right here.// Amy: Really? You have a piercing gun?// Penny: No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times.// Amy: Oh, I don’t know.// Penny: Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.// Bernadette: This party’s weird.// Leonard: Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.// Howard: Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.// Raj: Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?// Howard: I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?// Leonard: Sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool.// Sheldon: It is extraordinary.// Raj: Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.// Sheldon: I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.// Howard: Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.// Sheldon: What was that?// Howard: I think it’s a tyre.// Sheldon: What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?// Howard: It’s the tyre.// Sheldon: Leonard?// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: I am getting too old for this crud.// Bernadette: Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.// Amy: You’re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I’m no longer in a relationship.// Bernadette: Did you change yours to married yet?// Penny: Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally.// Amy: Who?// Penny: Oh, just my parents and my entire family.// Bernadette: What?// Amy: Why?// Penny: Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.// Bernadette: What about your sister’s wedding?// Penny: They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart.// Amy: How long do you think you can keep it from him?// Bernadette: Yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?// Penny: Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.// Scene: Mexico.// Raj: When did you learn how to change a tyre?// Howard: Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.// Sheldon: If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down.// Leonard: And there’s your damsel.// Howard: Wow, this one’s really stuck.// Raj: Are you turning it the right way?// Howard: No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I’m in a rut, let’s shake things up.// Raj: Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way.// Penny: There you go. You’re all done.// Amy: That wasn’t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet.// Bernadette: That’s a joke, right?// Amy: Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.// Penny: I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.// Bernadette: Bet she’d still tell her if she got married.// Penny: You’re not gonna let this go, are you?// Amy: Well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. I mean, they love Leonard.// Penny: Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?// Bernadette: It’s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.// Penny: Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?// Amy: Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven’t told her yet.// Penny: You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?// Amy: I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about.// Penny: Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother.// Amy: Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.// Penny: Hey, Daddy.// Penny’s Dad: Hey, slugger. How’s my girl?// Penny: Uh, good. Is Mom around?// Penny’s Dad: Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she’s gonna make him a little necklace.// Penny: Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.// Penny’s Dad: You did? When?// Penny: Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed.// Penny’s Dad: Are you happy?// Penny: Very. Leonard is so great.// Penny’s Dad: Well, then I’m happy for you.// Penny: Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.// Penny’s Dad: Well, I understand it’s hard to tell someone something if you think it’s gonna upset ’em.// Penny: It is. You’re the best dad ever.// Penny’s Dad: Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I’ve been sitting on a little news myself.// Penny: Well, what is it?// Penny’s Dad: You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?// Penny: No.// Penny’s Dad: Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.// Penny: Moondance?// Penny’s Dad: Yeah, he’s, uh, not dancing anymore.// Penny: You killed my pig?// Penny’s Dad: I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.// Penny: When?// Penny’s Dad: Oh, ten, twelve months ago.// Penny: You didn’t tell me for a year?// Penny’s Dad: Well, apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.// Bernadette: Okay, Amy, your turn.// Howard: What are you doing?// Raj: It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.// Howard: Great. He’s pushing with his uterus.// Raj: There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.// Leonard: Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.// Sheldon: Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.// Raj: Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.// Howard: Exactly. I’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.// Leonard: Let’s see, a lever, a lever.// Sheldon: Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.// Leonard: We’re gonna be here foreever.// Penny: Thanks a lot, guys.// Bernadette: What did we do?// Penny: Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.// Bernadette: Really? They didn’t eat him?// Penny: No. He was a beloved member of the family.// Bernadette: The breakfast meat family?// Penny: It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.// Amy: Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.// Penny: Phone, now.// Amy: Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.// Penny: Try dialing.// Amy: You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?// Penny: Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.// Leonard: I don’t think the lever’s working.// Howard: What makes you say that?// Leonard: There’s gotta be something else we could try.// Raj: If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.// Howard: No, it’s too broad of a beam. You’d need something more precise, like Superman’s heat vision.// Sheldon: Ooh, the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.// Raj: If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?// Sheldon: Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.// Leonard: Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?// Sheldon: Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up.// Caption: Scientific Principle: Percussive Shock.// Howard (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you.// (singing)// Howard and Raj (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you.// Sheldon (singing): Buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it’s a curse.// Caption: Scientific Principle: Thermal Expansion.// Raj: I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.// Leonard: They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands.// Sheldon: What if that burning food attracts animals?// Howard: We have plenty of food for the animals.// Sheldon: We do?// Howard: Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.// Sheldon: That’s not very nice.// Leonard: It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.// Caption: Scientific Principle: Accelerated Corrosion.// Sheldon: What is that awful smell?// Howard: It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.// Sheldon: What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit.// Howard: Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.// Caption: Scientific Principle: Exothermic Reaction.// Sheldon: All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.// Howard: Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.// Raj: Is that enough to melt the lug nut?// Leonard: Well, let’s start small. We can always add more.// Howard: You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match.// Scene: A moment later, next to the burning van.// Raj: Hey, look, the lug nut’s off.// Scene: The stairwell.// Penny: What? What are you doing back?// Leonard: We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.// Penny: Oh, I’m sorry.// Leonard: Thank you.// Penny: If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.// Sheldon: We blew up Feynman’s van.// Penny: My dad killed my pig with his tractor.// Leonard: I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.// Penny: You win.Series 09 Episode 04 – The 2003 Approximation// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: What a wonderful day, thank you.// Penny: Oh, we’re glad you had fun.// Sheldon: Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It’s like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.// Leonard: I still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You’re a young man.// Sheldon: Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I’m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?// Leonard: It’s just where I need them. You know, she doesn’t have a lot of closet space.// Sheldon: What’s wrong with your closet?// Penny: Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.// Sheldon: So that’s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?// Leonard: Come on, buddy.// Sheldon: No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might’ve said yes.// Penny: Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.// Sheldon: You know what they don’t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Sheldon: Thank you for letting me come speak with you.// Bernadette: Of course.// Sheldon: As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.// Bernadette: Aw. I’m honoured.// Sheldon: I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard’s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.// Bernadette: So, I’m your seventh choice.// Sheldon: Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.// Bernadette: How can I help you?// Sheldon: Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard’s moving in with Penny. It’s difficult not to feel abandoned.// Bernadette: Well, why don’t you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.// Sheldon: Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt’s all the rage right now. I wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.// Stuart: Hey.// Bernadette: Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?// Sheldon: Gandalf, but he’s a smoker.// Bernadette: Stuart. He’s been living with us for a while now. I’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair.// Stuart: Nope, couldn’t be happier.// Bernadette: Well, Sheldon’s looking for a roommate.// Stuart: Nope.// Bernadette: He’ll think about it.// Stuart: No I won’t.// Scene: The comic book store.// Raj: Have you seen this Archie comic? It’s actually Archie versus Predator.// Howard: How could Archie defeat Predator?// Raj: I don’t know. Maybe Jughead’s a Terminator.// Howard: Hey, Stuart.// Stuart: Do you guys know any musicians?// Howard: Why?// Stuart: I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe.// Howard: What kind of music are you thinking of?// Stuart: I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free.// Raj: Hey, we’ve always talked about playing together.// Howard: Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.// Raj: Oh, we could play filk music.// Stuart: What’s that?// Raj: It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.// Stuart: I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn’t be expected to pay for.// Raj: Dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name.// Howard: You know, I’ve actually had one I’ve been sitting on for years.// Raj: Really?// Howard: It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.// Raj: What is it?// Howard: Footprints on the Moon.// Raj: I just got chills.// Howard: So did I.// Stuart: Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Just a few more signatures, and we’ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I’d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.// Penny: I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well.// Sheldon: Well, it’s not like I’m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.// Leonard: Do I really have to do that now?// Sheldon: No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that’s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.// Penny: What’s the matter?// Leonard: It’s harder than I thought.// Sheldon: Let me help you. L. E. O. N.// Leonard: That helped.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj: So I have an idea for a filk song. It’s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.// Howard: Is it cold in here, ’cause, oh, my.// Raj: Okay, so it’s a, it’s a David and Goliath story. It’s about man against God. It’s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.// Howard: Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.// Raj: Okay, I don’t have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that’s no man, it’s a Norse god.// Howard: Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma.// Raj: That is, that is so good!// Howard: Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.// Raj: Okay, and here’s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.// Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.// Howard: Oh, man, that rocks.// Raj: Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?// Howard: Yeah?// Raj: That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.// Sheldon: I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.// Bespectacled Man: Sure.// Sheldon: It says here you’re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?// Bespectacled Man: Is that supposed to be a joke?// Sheldon: Looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.// Fade to another candidate.// Sheldon: In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?// Sheldon: I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?// Sheldon: You’re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I’ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the frontrunner.// Amy (on Skype): I’m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.// (on Skype)// Sheldon: But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.// Amy: I’m sure you’ll find somebody else.// Sheldon: I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I’d say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?// Amy: I don’t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.// Sheldon: They didn’t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.// Amy: I don’t think that was the point of the movie.// Sheldon: Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.// Amy: There you go.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: So, what are you thinking for dinner?// Leonard: Well, it’s Thai food night.// Penny: Well, honey, you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.// Leonard: You’re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?// Penny: How about Thai food?// Leonard: Oh, thank God.// Penny: Hey, we’re going to dinner. You want to come?// Sheldon: Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I’ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I’m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.// Leonard: You heard him, no.// Penny: Hang on. Wait, you actually think it’s 2003?// Sheldon: No, just because I’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean I’m delusional. And since it is 2003, I don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.// Scene: A Thai restaurant.// Penny: Are you doing okay?// Leonard: I guess. I’m just, you know, worried about Sheldon.// Penny: Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine.// Leonard: I hope so.// Penny: What else can you do? Move back in with him?// Leonard: No, of course not. I just feel bad.// Penny: Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?// Leonard: I did like that he had the weather on it.// Penny: Trust me, this is the right thing.// Leonard: I know. And it’s not like we’re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.// Scene: A bar.// Bernadette: I can’t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.// Amy: I can’t believe he ran my credit.// Bernadette: Hey, if you’re open to living with someone great, I’ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.// Amy: You really should’ve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.// Bernadette: I’m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.// Amy: Hey, I know Sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.// Sheldon: Hello, 2003.// Leonard: Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?// Sheldon: In my present, it’s in the future. In your present, it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.// Leonard: I know what you’re doing. You’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you, but it’s not happening.// Sheldon: No, what I’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.// Leonard: Will you knock it off? We’re across the hall.// Sheldon: As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.// Penny: They’re not saying that.// Sheldon: They are in 2003.// Penny: No, no, they’re really not.// Raj (singing): Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?// (singing)// Emily: Wow.// Raj: Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder.// Emily: Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.// Raj: Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?// Emily: I think it’s very cute.// Raj: Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.// Emily: Okay, fine, it’s not cute.// Raj: Just be honest. You don’t like it.// Emily: I didn’t say that. I, I just like music you can dance to.// Raj: You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.// Raj: I’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it.// Howard: Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.// Raj: You can do both, like Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. While you’re dancing you’re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?// Howard: Where’s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.// Raj: I still love it. I just think there’s room for improvement.// Howard: You played it for Emily, didn’t you?// Raj: Yeah, so what?// Howard: You are such a wimp. She didn’t like it, now you don’t like it.// Raj: No, no. I’m just evolving as a musician. You’re the one who’s stuck in the past.// Howard: The past was lunch. You know what’s really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.// Raj: She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.// Howard: Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to sleep with you.// Raj: That is so not true.// Howard: Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?// Raj: That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.// Howard: I don’t need this. I’m quitting the band.// Raj: Fine, I quit, too.// Howard: Then get out of my house.// Raj: With pleasure.// Howard: Raj, wait.// Raj: What took you so long?// Leonard: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it’s not.// Sheldon: How can you say that? Amy’s gone, and you two are married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone, too.// Penny: Okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen.// Sheldon: No, I do. Eventually you’ll want more space, and you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding, where she’s marrying someone better than me.// Penny: Okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here.// Sheldon: But mostly here.// Penny: Sure.// Leonard: Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?// Penny: Well, it’s not forever. It’s just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he’s our dog.// Sheldon: You can. I’m happy when you come home. And I’m scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we’re all sleeping here.// Leonard: Fine.// Sheldon: All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I’ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we’re good.// Howard (singing): Indy’ whip snapped, Thor’s hammer missed.// // Raj (singing): It was Avenger versus archeologist.// Howard: Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.// Raj: Thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.// Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.// Stuart: Play something we can dance to.Series 09 Episode 05 – The Perspiration Implementation// Scene: Howard’s workshop.// Leonard: Hey, ready for lunch?// Howard: Oh, one sec.// Sheldon: Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?// Howard: No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising.// Leonard: That’ll teach her to care about your health.// Howard: Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.// Raj: When was the last actual exercise you got?// Howard: The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.// Sheldon: According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.// Raj: Are you?// Sheldon: Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.// Leonard: It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.// Howard: You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.// Sheldon: Had me at flag, lost me at football.// Penny: Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?// Leonard: What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?// Penny: Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.// Leonard: I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.// Sheldon: Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.// Leonard: It’s indoors, so no sunscreen.// Sheldon: No throwing, no catching, no running.// Leonard: No gym shorts that can be yanked down.// Sheldon: Or worse, up.// Leonard: Preach.// Sheldon: And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.// Leonard: What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?// Sheldon: Ah, touché.// Scene: The comic book store.// Stuart: Thanks for coming by.// Bernadette: Sure. So how can we help?// Stuart: Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can’t get ’em in here.// Penny: All right, well, what have you tried so far?// Stuart: Uh, I’ve, I’ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.// Penny: Really? In a comic book store?// Stuart: Oh, don’t worry. I, I’ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?// Amy: Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog.// Stuart: Well, you don’t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.// Scene: The gym.// Raj: I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.// Leonard: I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.// Sheldon: Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have.// Raj: We can still be swashers.// Howard: Well said, Puss.// Barry: Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn’t a joke. I hope you’re not here because you think it’s going to be wike Star Wars.// Leonard: That’s not why we’re here.// Raj: Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.// Howard: And maybe a little Princess Bride.// Raj: Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.// Barry: Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you’re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.// Sheldon: We’re not afraid of physical activity.// Howard: Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.// Barry: Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.// Sheldon: Oh, dear.// Barry: What’s wong, Cooper?// Sheldon: Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.// Howard: When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?// Sheldon: Right. Always right.// Howard: He’s a righty.// Barry: Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.// Howard: Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.// Barry: The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.// Leonard: This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.// Barry: Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.// Sheldon: Excuse me, Barry?// Barry: Yes.// Sheldon: When can I stab one of my friends?// Barry: In fencing, we don’t call it a stab. We call it a touch.// Sheldon: Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources.// Barry: Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. (Phone rings) Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I’m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.// (Phone rings)// Amy: Have you thought about advertising directly to females?// Stuart: Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don’t be afraid.// Penny: Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?// Stuart: Eh, the Internet’s so negative. I try to avoid it.// Penny: All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.// Stuart: See? Negative.// Barry: With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.// Raj: Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.// Sheldon: En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.// Howard: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.// Raj: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.// Howard: I thought you were Puss in Boots.// Raj: Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.// Sheldon: I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.// Leonard: When was your honour insulted?// Sheldon: My last physical.// Leonard: Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.// Raj: My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.// Howard: My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.// Sheldon: Ah, this is fun.// Leonard: Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy.// Barry: What’s going on with Amy?// Sheldon: Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.// Barry: Weawwy? Good to know.// Sheldon: Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?// Leonard: Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.// Sheldon: Well, that’s unacceptable.// Leonard: Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you.// Sheldon: Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb.// Leonard: Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.// Sheldon: You really think so?// Leonard: Of course. She deserves to be happy.// Sheldon: How dare you.// Scene: Later.// Leonard: Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.// Sheldon: Barry, a word?// Leonard: And now the crazy version of what I just said.// Sheldon: If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.// Barry: And how are you gonna do that?// Sheldon: By challenging you to a duel.// Barry: You’ve had one wesson. I’ll destwoy you.// Sheldon: That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.// Leonard: Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.// Stuart: All right, I’m not saying it’s true, but let’s, let’s consider for a moment that possibly I’m the problem.// Penny: Yeah.// Bernadette: You are.// Amy: You can say it.// Stuart: Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.// Penny: Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.// Stuart: Well, that’s ’cause I’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.// Amy: Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?// Stuart: It was a joke.// Bernadette: Was it?// Stuart: No, I’m still doing it.// Penny: Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?// Stuart: I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself.// Bernadette: That really happened?// Stuart: I mean, I can’t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I’m alone, the more desperate I get.// Amy: Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.// Stuart: Okay, we’re all feeling it. Yes, I’ll go out with you.// Amy: Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.// Scene: A sports bar.// Leonard: I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.// Leonard: If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.// Howard: Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.// Sheldon: That’s ridiculous.// Raj: Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.// Sheldon: True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.// Leonard: Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?// Sheldon: There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.// Raj: Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.// Sheldon: You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.// Raj: How many sips of that beer did he have?// Leonard: Three.// Howard: Oh, boy.// Sheldon: Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.// Woman: What?// Sheldon: It’s a Pokémon reference.// Woman: I don’t know what that means.// Sheldon: Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?// Older woman: I’m married, and I’m her grandmother.// Sheldon: Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: Stuart took that rejection like a pro.// Penny: Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.// Amy: I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.// Bernadette: Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.// Penny: And sometimes we marry them anyway.// Amy (Phone text sound): Huh. Well, this is weird.// (Phone text sound)// Penny: What?// Amy: Barry Kripke just asked me out.// Bernadette: Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.// Penny: I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.// Bernadette: What did he say?// Amy: Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime.// Penny: Well, what are you gonna do?// Amy: I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.// Bernadette: What can it hurt?// Amy: Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.// Bernadette: You mean, not a scientist?// Penny: I think she means not a weirdo.// Bernadette: Are you attracted to him?// Amy: I don’t know.// Penny: All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?// Amy: Oh, I don’t have to imagine it.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: I smell funny. I taste salty.// Leonard: You’re just sweaty from exercise.// Sheldon: And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.// Leonard: I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.// Amy: Hello.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: We should let you guys talk.// Bernadette: Yeah.// Sheldon: You don’t have to leave.// Leonard: Look at me go.// Amy: Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride.// Bernadette: Walk.// Amy: How have you been?// Sheldon: I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.// Amy: How’d that go?// Sheldon: It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.// Amy: Well, actually, he, he already did.// Sheldon: Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man.// Amy: I said no.// Sheldon: Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.// Amy: I didn’t know you were interested in dating.// Sheldon: I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.// Amy: Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good.// Sheldon: Thanks. And I taste good too.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Bernadette: Howie?// Howard: What’s up?// Bernadette: Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?Series 09 Episode 06 – The Helium Insufficiency// Scene: Leonard’s lab.// Sheldon: Leonard, I’ve got terrible news.// Leonard: What’s going on?// Sheldon: Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical.// Leonard: Just tell me.// Sheldon: A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.// Leonard: Oh, well, that kind of stinks.// Sheldon: That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.// Leonard: What are we going to do?// Sheldon: Perform the experiment immediately.// Leonard: I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month.// Sheldon: A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.// Leonard: That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.// Sheldon: Thank you. Aren’t you sweet.// Leonard: Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.// Sheldon: Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?// Scene: Barry Kripke’s office.// Leonard: Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?// Barry: Sowwy, there’s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.// Sheldon: But you won’t need much for that.// Barry: Twue, but if it’s successful, I’m having a pawty with bawwoons.// Leonard: Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?// Barry: Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: Not a chance.// Leonard: What are you doing?// Sheldon: He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So, what do you say?// Barry: Hell no.// Sheldon: He could’ve softened the blow.// Credits sequence.// Raj: Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?// Leonard: We’d have to go to every Party City in California.// Howard: Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.// Raj: Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.// Sheldon: Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.// Howard: If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions.// Leonard: Who is he?// Sheldon: Where does he work?// Leonard: How does he get the helium?// Sheldon: How many questions are too many questions?// Howard: Maybe he’s not for you.// Sheldon: Four questions. There answer’s four.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.// Penny: Oh, good for him.// Bernadette: I thought so, too.// Penny: So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?// Bernadette: He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.// Penny: Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.// Bernadette: I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.// Penny: Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.// Stuart: What’s up?// Bernadette: Can you show us that dating app?// Stuart: Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.// Penny: Wow. So how many girls have you met?// Stuart: Two. I probably don’t need to mention there’s an entire number between that and zero.// Penny: Well, so how does it work?// Stuart: Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don’t, thumbs down.// Bernadette: Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?// Stuart: First time it happens I will let you know.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.// Sheldon: What’s he say?// Leonard: He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.// Sheldon: Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?// Leonard: The man restocking the cereal shelves.// Sheldon: That’s right. And what did he do?// Leonard: He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.// Sheldon: It’s like it was yesterday.// Leonard: Do you want liquid helium or not?// Sheldon: Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us.// Leonard: Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.// Sheldon: Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.// Leonard: We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.// Sheldon: Was she helping him with his research?// Leonard: Sure. So, are we doing this?// Sheldon: Well, but where does he get the helium?// Leonard: Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?// Sheldon: Uh, but this is violating university code.// Leonard: A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.// Sheldon: Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in.// Leonard: Done.// Sheldon: I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?// Leonard: Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.// Sheldon: Aren’t you just made of sugar.// Amy: I’m not sure how I feel about this.// Penny: Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.// Bernadette: Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.// Stuart: One of which would’ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.// Penny: Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute.// Bernadette: Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?// Penny: And he’s sad about it.// Howard: Hey.// Raj: Hello.// Penny: Hey.// Bernadette: Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?// Howard: If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money.// Raj: What are you guys up to?// Bernadette: We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there.// Raj: Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.// Howard: What was wrong with that guy?// Raj: Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.// Howard: Hey, I want to try.// Amy: Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?// Howard: Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?// Scene: A parking garage.// Leonard: That must be him.// Sheldon: Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.// Leonard: Hey.// Man: What’s up?// Leonard: Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…// Sheldon: I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.// Man: Great. You got the cash?// Leonard: Uh, yeah, uh, right here.// Sheldon: Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?// Leonard: What ya doing, Skippy?// Sheldon: Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.// Man: Oh, how do I know you’re not gonna drive away without paying me?// Sheldon: Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.// Leonard: Look, you can trust us. We’re respected scientists.// Sheldon: Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage.// Man: Yeah, well, from my perspective, that’s how you two appear to me.// Sheldon: Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?// Leonard: My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.// Man: Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we’re at a, uh, stalemate.// Sheldon: Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination.// Man: Huh. All these years I’ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.// Leonard: I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?// Man: Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.// Sheldon: Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.// Man: Hmm, I don’t follow.// Sheldon: Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.// Man: Is that a threat?// Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it.// Man: Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I’ll report you, then I’ll pound your asses into the ground.// Sheldon: Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?// Leonard: Afraid so, Skippy.// Sheldon: I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.// Leonard: All right, let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.// Man: No, I don’t like this. I’m out.// Leonard: No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year.// Man: Really? What’s the hypothesis?// Sheldon: Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.// Man: Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.// Leonard: Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.// Sheldon: And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.// Leonard: Here’s the money. Can we do this?// Man: Okay. It’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.// Leonard: It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.// Man: Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there’s, uh, plenty we could do about it.// Sheldon: Did you hear that, Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?// Penny: Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?// Raj: You know he won’t be looking at other girls.// Howard: Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.// Penny: Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.// Bernadette: Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.// Penny: Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.// Howard: I love you, Amy. (Dolphin noises)// (Dolphin noises)// Amy: Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?// Raj: That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.// Penny: Look, it’s Stuart.// Raj: You may want to leave the room.// Sheldon: Right this way, Uncle Harvey.// Leonard: Will you stop with that already?// Sheldon: I’m trying not to attract attention.// Leonard: And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?// Sheldon: She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?// Leonard: Let’s just start the experiment.// Sheldon: Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.// Leonard: We’re not getting caught.// Sheldon: Well, you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?// Leonard: The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.// Sheldon: Uh-oh.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: Well, did you see this sticker?// Leonard: What is it?// Sheldon: It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.// Leonard: It’s probably USC or UCLA.// Sheldon: Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime.// Leonard: Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.// Sheldon: That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.// Leonard: Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.// Scene: A university corridor.// Leonard: Ma’am.// Penny: Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull.// Raj: I have that same underwear.// Penny: Chug.// Penny: Amy, you’re getting a text.// Amy: Oh, um, give me that.// Raj: I had a great time last night.// Amy: No, no, stop reading that.// Howard: Who’s Dave?// Penny: You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?// Amy: No, it, it’s not like that.// Bernadette: And I’d love to take you out again”?// All: Amy/What?/Can’t believe it/Oh, my God.// Amy: Okay, it’s like that.// Scene: The parking garage.// Leonard: Thank you for coming back.// Man: Yeah, well, normally I wouldn’t, but my daughter’s having a sleepover, and there’s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.// Sheldon: Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way.// Man: Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?// Leonard: No, nothing. We just changed our mind.// Sheldon: He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.// Man: Yeah, I hear you. Well, you’re good guys, so I’ll, uh, I’ll take the helium off your hands.// Leonard: Thank you.// Man: But you ain’t getting your money back.// Sheldon: You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.// Man: Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.// Leonard: You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.// Man: No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.// Sheldon: I don’t understand.// Leonard: He wants more money.// Sheldon: Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me.// Man: That’s exactly how much it is.// Sheldon: Finally, something breaks our way.// Penny: I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.// Bernadette: Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?// Amy: Because it’s new and weird and I’m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.// Stuart: A few people?// Bernadette: What?// Penny: Amy.// Stuart: So, are we allowed to ask how it’s going?// Amy: It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.// Raj: What? I thought we were all… never mind.// Bernadette: I, I thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people.// Amy: Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.// Penny: Well, good for you.// Amy: Thank you.// Bernadette: And how many guys have you gone out with?// Stuart: Please be less than two.// Amy: Three.// Stuart: Damn it.// Sheldon: Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison.// Leonard: Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?// Sheldon: It scared me straight, Leonard.// Barry: Hey, I’ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.// Leonard: Thank you, Barry.// Barry: But you have to add my name to your paper.// Sheldon: That’s preposterous.// Barry: I don’t know, seems fair. You can’t do it without me.// Leonard: Can you give us a minute?// Barry: Take your time. I’ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.// Sheldon: I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.// Leonard: Me neither, but what other choice do we have?// Leonard: I promise this is the last time.// Leonard: It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.// Sheldon: How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?// Helium Man: They should’ve used among, right?// Sheldon: Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.// Helium Man: All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?// Sheldon: Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.// Helium Man: I am open to change.Series 09 Episode 07 – The Spock Resonance// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?// Raj: Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.// Penny: In school?// Raj: Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.// Penny: Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?// Leonard: You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.// Sheldon: Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.// Leonard: Why is he writing to you?// Sheldon: Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it.// Raj: Oh. Hey, high five.// Sheldon: Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?// Penny: Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.// Sheldon: This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: Hey. You got a minute?// Howard: Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.// Bernadette: Pause the game, Howard.// Howard: Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?// Bernadette: We need to talk about redecorating this place.// Howard: Oh, no, not this again.// Bernadette: Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.// Howard: Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?// Bernadette: All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.// Howard: May I say something?// Bernadette: Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?// Howard: Never mind.// Sheldon (on phone): Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I’m no longer in your life.// (on phone)// Leonard: I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.// Penny: And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.// Sheldon (answering door): Hello.// (answering door):// Wil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.// Adam: Nice to meet you.// Sheldon: Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum.// Wil: I told you. This guy is gold.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Bernadette: Whatcha doing?// Howard: Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.// Bernadette: Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.// Howard: I’m listening.// Bernadette: Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.// Howard: That is reasonable. But what room?// Bernadette: How ’bout this one?// Howard: No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.// Bernadette: Then how ’bout the bathroom?// Howard: I want to change my answer.// Bernadette: Fine. Then the dining room.// Howard: I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…// Bernadette: Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.// Adam: All right, we’re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera’s not here.// Sheldon: All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.// Leonard: How long have you known Adam?// Wil: A few years.// Leonard: And what are you getting him back for?// Adam: Let’s start with your name and occupation.// Sheldon: Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.// Adam: And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?// Sheldon: The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine.// Adam: What was it about Spock that appealed to you?// Sheldon: I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.// Penny: Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.// Leonard: My brother was mean to me, too.// Penny: Yeah, you probably had it coming.// Adam: Do you have any Spock collectibles?// Sheldon: I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.// Penny: Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.// Adam: Can we see the napkin?// Sheldon: Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.// Leonard: When did we get a wall safe?// Sheldon: When there was no more room in the floor safe.// Leonard: When did we get a floor safe?// Sheldon: When we got the security camera.// Leonard: There’s a security camera?// Sheldon: Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.// Penny: Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.// Sheldon: Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.// Raj: So, your father-in-law is in there right now?// Howard: Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.// Raj: Oh, okay. Got it.// Howard: Hey. What’s going on?// Raj: Hey.// Bernadette: Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.// Raj: You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.// Mr Rostenkowski: What’s so great about it?// Raj: I’m sorry. I did what I could.// Bernadette: Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?// Howard: Your dad’s on your side.// Bernadette: He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.// Raj: That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.// Howard: Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing.// Raj: Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.// Howard: When is your visa up?// Sheldon: Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.// Wil: Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?// Sheldon: No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.// Penny: Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?// Sheldon: Wouldn’t you like to know?// Penny: I would.// Sheldon: All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.// Leonard: You have a will?// Sheldon: Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.// Leonard: Will Wil want it?// Wil: Wil won’t.// Penny: Oh, what’s that ring box?// Sheldon: Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.// Penny: What?// Leonard: You bought her a ring?// Sheldon: No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.// Wil: Sheldon, that’s awful.// Sheldon: No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.// Penny: Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?// Sheldon: No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.// Leonard: Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.// Sheldon: No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.// Penny: I know. It just…// Sheldon (shouting): I said I’m fine! (Long pause) We’ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?// (shouting)// (Long pause)// Adam: Did you find that helpful?// Sheldon: Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.// Penny: I knew I could smell ’em.// Adam: What about from when you were a kid?// Sheldon: Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.// Adam: Did it work?// Sheldon: Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.// Adam: That must have been very upsetting for you.// Sheldon: Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.// Penny: Oh pfft.// Sheldon: Excuse me?// Penny: I’m sorry. I’m not here.// Sheldon: No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?// Penny: Um.// Leonard: You did go pfft.// Penny: All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.// Leonard: Just like you.// Penny: I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.// Sheldon: Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.// Penny: Sweetie, you’re yelling.// Sheldon: Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.// Wil: This documentary is gonna be awesome.// Scene: The crawlspace under Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Mr Rostenkowski: You gonna be okay down here?// Howard: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.// Mr Rostenkowski: Yeah, that’s a rat skull.// Howard: Oh.// Mr Rostenkowski: Relax. There’s enough droppings down here without you making more.// Howard: Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?// Mr Rostenkowski: Yeah. I think that’s the den.// Howard: Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.// Mr Rostenkowski: Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.// Howard: Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?// Mr Rostenkowski: ‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids.// Howard: That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.// Mr Rostenkowski: Huh.// Howard: I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…// Bernadette (above): Earthquake.// (above)// Howard: Oh, my God, we’re gonna die.// Bernadette: Aftershock.// Penny: I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.// Leonard: I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.// Penny: Yeah.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: Hey, buddy. How you doing?// Sheldon: Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?// Leonard: Oh, yeah.// Penny: Definitely.// Sheldon: Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.// Penny: Do you know what that means?// Leonard: No.// Penny: Are you telling the truth?// Leonard: Nirsh.// Sheldon: Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.// Penny: What are you gonna do?// Sheldon: I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.// Leonard: He didn’t meant that.// Bernadette: So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.// Howard: That would be nice.// Bernadette: I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.// Howard: But you were okay throwing me under the bus?// Bernadette: Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it.// Mr Rostenkowski: Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.// Bernadette: Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?// Mr Rostenkowski: This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.// Raj: It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.// Howard: Why are you still here?// Raj: Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.// Howard: All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.// Bernadette: Why?// Howard: Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there.// Bernadette: Okay, I’ll think about it.// Howard: And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?// Bernadette: It’s an actual I’ll think about it.// Howard: I really believe I’d be a great dad.// Bernadette: I know you would.// Howard: Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?// Scene: The street. Sheldon sees Amy with another man. He leaves.// Kirk (on screen): Dr. Dana feels he isn’t that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?// (on screen)// Spock (on screen): Because she feels. I don’t. All I know is logic.// Sheldon: Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?// Leonard: Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.// Sheldon: Those are very wise words.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.Series 09 Episode 08 – The Mystery Date Observation// After a “previously on” sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.// Leonard: Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.// Penny: Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?// Leonard: Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.// Penny: Oh, I don’t want credit for that.// Sheldon: Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.// Leonard: You’re in a good mood.// Sheldon: Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.// Penny: Oh. Good for you.// Leonard: What brought this on?// Sheldon: I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.// Penny: And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.// Sheldon: No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.// Leonard: Hey, I made French toast sticks.// Sheldon: On oatmeal day?// Leonard: Ah, I also made oatmeal.// Sheldon: Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like.// Penny: Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.// Credits sequence.// Sheldon: Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.// Howard: No problem.// Raj: So what’s up?// Sheldon: Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.// Howard: You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you.// Sheldon: Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.// Raj: You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.// Howard: Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy.// Raj: Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.// Sheldon: Gentlemen.// Raj: Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.// Howard: But what are you looking for?// Sheldon: All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.// Howard: Isn’t that a little unreasonable?// Sheldon: All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Come on, Amy, show us the dress.// Amy: Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.// Penny: Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.// Bernadette: Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.// Amy: Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.// Penny: No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.// Amy: Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall.// Penny: Ooh.// Bernadette: Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.// Penny: Yeah, come on, tell us more.// Amy: Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?// Bernadette: Did you kiss him yet?// Amy: Just a little peck on the lips.// Penny: Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.// Amy: Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one.// Penny: All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?// Bernadette: Tea and basketball?// Amy: To that new Italian place on Walnut.// Bernadette: Oh, nice.// Amy: I’m gonna go look for other shoes.// Penny: Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.// Bernadette: Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?// Penny: We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.// Bernadette: I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and check the reservation.// Penny: Damn, you’re sneaky.// Bernadette: Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable.// Howard: I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.// Sheldon: Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.// Raj: And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?// Sheldon: Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.// Howard: If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?// Sheldon: Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.// Howard: You seriously think women would fight for you?// Sheldon: People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?// Howard: He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes.// Raj: Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.// Howard: Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist.// Sheldon: And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.// Raj: I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.// Howard: I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.// Sheldon: Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.// Raj: Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.// Howard: Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.// Raj: I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.// Howard: Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize.// Scene: The stairwell.// Leonard: I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.// Penny: Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.// Leonard: What? I don’t want to do that.// Penny: What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?// Leonard: This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.// Penny: No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.// Leonard: So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?// Penny: You’re not curious who she’s out with?// Leonard: Not really.// Penny: But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.// Sheldon: That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.// Howard: Congratulations.// Raj: This is exciting.// Sheldon: Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.// Howard: Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.// Sheldon: And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.// Raj: I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.// Howard: Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.// Sheldon: Golly, she sounds too good to be true.// Scene: A restaurant.// Tall British Dave: This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my divorce.// Amy: Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?// Dave: Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.// Amy: Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry.// Dave: No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.// (in the car outside)// Penny: Hey. So, where are they?// Bernadette: Across the street, in the left window.// Penny: Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.// Bernadette: Right here.// Leonard: You just happen to have those in the car?// Bernadette: Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.// Leonard: By stalking them?// Bernadette: No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.// Penny: Oh, there he is.// Bernadette: He’s cute, right?// Penny: Yeah.// Leonard: Can I see?// Penny: What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.// Leonard: I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.// Penny: Fine.// Leonard: Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.// Bernadette: Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone.// Penny: Your what?// Bernadette: Nothing. Not important.// Dave: So you’ve never been married?// Amy: No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship.// Dave: Oh. What happened with that?// Amy: That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.// Dave: Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?// Amy: No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.// Dave: I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What’s his focus?// Amy: Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you.// Dave: Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?// Amy: I’m trying not to. Do you know him?// Dave: No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?// Penny: He really seems into her.// Bernadette: I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.// Leonard: Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?// Bernadette: Why’d you bring him?// Penny: I had to; we’re married now.// Bernadette: Ugh, I hear that.// Dave: I’m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.// Amy: Sure, why not?// Dave: It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?// Amy: Um about an hour and half.// Dave: Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?// Amy: Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.// Dave: Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he’s a genius, and I wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.// Amy: What was the rest of your question?// Dave: Do you think you could introduce me to him?// Amy: Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?// Dave: You’re right, it’s, it’s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I’d be too nervous. Oh, I don’t know what to do.// Leonard: Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.// Raj: 37 minutes left until the deadline.// Sheldon: Someone will show.// Howard: And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.// Raj: Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.// Raj: Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.// Sheldon: Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.// Scene: The restaurant.// Dave: You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.// Amy: I have a DVD of that lecture.// Dave: Really? Wasn’t it great?// Amy: Not as a Valentine’s present, no.// Dave: Well, the next time you watch it, I’m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.// Amy: That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?// Dave: Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot.// Amy: No, you’re not.// Dave: Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won’t mention.// Amy: Thank you.// Dave: That you said you might introduce me to, I’m free on Thursday.// Bernadette: Hey, hey, they’re leaving.// Penny: What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they’re coming right towards us.// Bernadette: We got to get out of here.// Penny: Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?// Bernadette: He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. (Reverses into car behind)// (Reverses into car behind)// Penny: Oh, no.// Dave: She just hit my car.// Amy: What are you guys doing here?// Bernadette: Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?// Leonard: What happened?// Dave: O-M-G. Aren’t you Leonard Hofstadter?// Leonard: Yeah.// Dave: I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It’s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.// Amy: No. Pinch me.// Dave: It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?// Leonard: I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.// Dave: Amy, I’m never washing this hand again.// Leonard: You really should.// Raj: Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.// Sheldon: One minute is a long time.// Howard: I’ve been telling women that for 20 years.// Raj: Forty-five.// Sheldon: 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.// Raj: Thirty seconds.// Sheldon: Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?// Howard: What?// Sheldon: Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.// Howard: You thought she was great in X-Men.// Sheldon: Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.// Raj: Guys, fifteen seconds.// Howard: Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.// Sheldon: Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.// Raj: Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad.// Howard: Maybe we did make the test too difficult.// Raj: I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because… (knock on door) we are the dreamers of dreams.// (knock on door)// Howard: It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty.// Raj: Answer it.// Sheldon: All right. Can I help you?// Girl: Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?// Sheldon: Yes.// Girl: Hi. I’m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I’ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.// Sheldon: Careful, it’s addictive.// Vanessa: Chija”e’vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.// Sheldon: And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.// Vanessa: Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don’t need to tell you, there aren’t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.// Sheldon: I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.// Raj: How could you send her away?// Sheldon: She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Dave: Uh, thanks for driving me home.// Amy: No problem. I’m really sorry about your car.// Dave: Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love to take you out again.// Amy: Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out.// Dave: Oh. Okay.// Amy: I’m, I’m really sorry.// Dave: No, it’s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.// Amy: There you go.// Dave: If I ever do meet him, we’ll have that in common.// Amy: Sure. Heh.// Dave: And, he’s kissed you and I’ve kissed you, so if you think about it…// Amy: Okay, get out.Series 09 Episode 09 – The Platonic Permutation// Scene: The apartment.// Raj: Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?// Howard: No. How does it work?// Raj: You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?// Siri: The time is 6:37 p.m.// Howard: So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.// Raj: Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.// Howard: Oh. Cool. (In thick Indian accent) Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.// (In thick Indian accent)// Raj: I don’t sound like that.// Siri: Here are some images of naked grandma butts.// Sheldon: Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won’t be going alone, I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?// Leonard: Well, we’re having everyone over.// Penny: Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.// Leonard: Otherwise we’d love to.// Penny: But we can’t.// Leonard: Yeah, poor us.// Penny: Mm-hmm.// Bernadette: And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.// Sheldon: Well, Howard, what about you?// Howard: Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too.// Bernadette: You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.// Howard: If you can’t support me when I’m lying, why are we married?// Credits sequence.// Amy (on skype): Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?// (on skype)// Sheldon: Well, I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.// Amy: No one can go with you?// Sheldon: No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like.// Amy: Oh. Okay. Thank you.// Sheldon: And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.// Amy: Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.// Sheldon: You don’t think that will be awkward?// Amy: Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it’ll be fine.// Sheldon: Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.// Amy: See you then.// Sheldon: Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.// Amy: Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?// Sheldon: And there goes my list.// Scene: Outside the soup kitchen.// Emily: So, how does this work?// Bernadette: The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.// Howard: Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long.// Raj: Do you ever do anything for anyone else?// Howard: I happen to be a giving and generous lover.// Emily: Are you and I close enough for me to say that’s creepy?// Bernadette: We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.// Soup Kitchen Manager: Uh, can I help you?// Bernadette: Hi. We’d like to volunteer.// Soup Kitchen Manager: Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.// Bernadette: Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.// Howard: Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.// Emily: Are you and I close enough for me to say…// Bernadette: That he’s an ass? He beat you to it.// Soup Kitchen Manager: I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.// Bernadette: Oh, great. We’d love to help.// Howard: Wipe that smug smile off your face.// Bernadette: I can’t.// Penny: Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.// Leonard: I know. I feel so grown up.// Penny: Sweetie, you are grown up.// Leonard: Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?// Penny: Yep. What’s the code?// Leonard: My birthday.// Penny: It’s not working.// Leonard: It’s just the four digits, month and day.// Penny: Nope.// Leonard: Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?// Penny: Uh.// Leonard: You don’t know my birthday, do you?// Penny: Yes, I do.// Leonard: Well, what is it?// Penny: May.// Leonard: May what?// Penny: I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.// Leonard: You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.// Penny: Well, you don’t know everything about me.// Leonard: Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.// Penny: Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Sheldon: Hello.// Amy: Hi. Ready for the aquarium?// Sheldon: I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.// Amy: If that makes you more comfortable.// Sheldon: If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?// Amy: No. You?// Sheldon: No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?// Amy: I might go visit my aunt next week.// Sheldon: Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?// Amy: No, the one in Bakersfield.// Sheldon: Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?// Scene: The soup kitchen.// Soup Kitchen Manager: We’re gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I’ll be around.// Howard: So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?// Bernadette: What difference does it make?// Howard: I don’t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.// Raj: You’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!// Howard: It’s not like I’m expecting them to sing.// Sheldon: and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.// Amy: Are we done discussing the weather?// Sheldon: I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.// Amy: Sheldon. We’ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.// Sheldon: All right. Well, what should we talk about?// Amy: I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.// Sheldon: Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?// Amy: Man, I walked right into that one.// Leonard: Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.// Penny: Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?// Leonard: Baby.// Penny: Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?// Leonard: Justin.// Penny: Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?// Leonard: Nice try. NSYNC forever.// Penny: Damn it.// Leonard: Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…// Penny: Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?// Leonard: Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.// Penny: Interesting. I never told you that.// Leonard: Sure you did.// Penny: No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.// Leonard: What? I didn’t know you had a journal.// Penny: I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.// Leonard: No, it doesn’t.// Raj: You know, this reminds me of high school.// Emily: You worked in a restaurant?// Raj: No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.// Howard: All right, I think I’m getting into a groove here. This isn’t so bad.// Emly: Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.// Howard: We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?// Raj: You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.// Howard: Just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.// Raj: No, seriously. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It’s about, it’s about simply being.// Howard: Huh. Okay, I’ll try it.// Soup Kitchen Manager: I need three people out front.// Bernadette: I’ll do it.// Raj: Me.// Emily: Right here!// Howard: No fair, I was meditating.// Leonard: Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.// Penny: How can reading my journal be an accident?// Leonard: I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.// Penny: Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?// Leonard: You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm.// Penny: All right. Let’s just finish cooking.// Leonard: Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.// Penny: Okay, really, I’m fine.// Leonard: Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.// Penny: Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.// Leonard: Fine. Mmm, Penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”// Penny: Does it really say that?// Leonard: Why would I lie?// Penny: OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?// Leonard: Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.// Sheldon: I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.// Amy: No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.// Sheldon: All right.// Amy: So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.// Sheldon: Just a few.// Amy: Go ahead.// Sheldon: How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.// Amy: Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.// Sheldon: Is that regular or honey nut?// Amy: I mixed them.// Sheldon: You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?// Amy: Just one. Are you doing okay?// Sheldon: I am.// Amy: Good. I want you to be happy.// Sheldon: I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.// Man: Here you go.// Howard: Thanks. You got to be kidding me.// Man: Sorry?// Howard: Y, you’re Elon Musk.// Elon: I am.// Howard: Wh, what are you doing here?// Elon: I’m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.// Howard: Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I’m, I’m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.// Elon: Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?// Howard: Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer.// Elon: And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.// Howard: Sorry. It’s just, you’re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.// Elon: Well, you’re here on Thanksgiving, so you’re probably a good person.// Howard: Oh. I made my wife come down, too.// Elon: You think you might ever get back out to space?// Howard: Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on.// Elon: Well, we’re not quite there yet, but we’re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.// Howard: Thank you.// Elon: Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?// Howard: A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.// Scene: The aquarium.// Sheldon: You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.// Amy: You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.// Sheldon: They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.// Amy: Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.// Sheldon: Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?// Amy: Sure. What is it?// Sheldon: It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.// Amy: So it’s like Kiss, Marry, Kill.// Sheldon: What is that?// Amy: It’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill.// Sheldon: Well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.// Amy: Let’s just play.// Sheldon: I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.// Amy: Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.// Sheldon: Very well done.// Amy: Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.// Sheldon: Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?// Amy: But you can pal around with a hagfish?// Sheldon: Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish.// Amy: Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.// Sheldon: I know. It makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down.// Amy: I miss this.// Sheldon: How can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?// Amy: I guess sometimes I’m silly.// Penny: Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done.// Leonard: Be right there. Hi, lover.// Penny: What are you doing?// Leonard: I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.// Penny: I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.// Leonard: Don’t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?// Penny: Oh.// Leonard: Huh? Some of this? And, since it’s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?// Bernadette: Happy Thanks… Yikes.// Leonard: I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.// Sheldon: Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.// Penny: Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.// Sheldon: Oh, I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. (Phone rings) Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello.// (Phone rings)// Amy: Hi, Sheldon. I’m just driving home from my mother’s.// Sheldon: Did you have a nice time?// Amy: I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.// Sheldon: Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.// Amy: It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again.// Sheldon: Oh. I thought we were just friends.// Amy: We are. But I was hoping, maybe…// Sheldon: Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.// Amy: Okay. I understand.// Sheldon: Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.// Amy: Okay. Sure.Series 09 Episode 10 – The Earworm Reverberation// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.// Scene: The apartment. 2 days earlier.// Leonard: Since when do you hum songs?// Sheldon: What are you talking about?// Leonard: You were just humming.// Sheldon: Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.// Leonard: How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?// Sheldon: Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?// Leonard: Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?// Sheldon (singing): Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.// (singing)// Leonard: Whatever. Can we just get back to this?// Sheldon: I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put my finger on it. (Singing) My country, ’tis of thee. No.// (Singing)// Leonard: It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.// Sheldon: Okay. (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.// Leonard: Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?// Sheldon (singing): I’m surprised you have to ask.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon (on phone): Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.// (on phone)// Leonard: Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.// Penny: Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.// Sheldon: Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me.// Penny: I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself.// Sheldon: I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.// Penny: Public nudity?// Leonard: Eh, that just means going barefoot.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Dave (voice on phone): Hello?// (voice on phone)// Amy: Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy.// Dave: Oh. How are you?// Amy: I’m fine. How are you?// Dave: Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.// Amy: Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.// Dave: So, to what do I owe the pleasure?// Amy: Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime.// Dave: Yes, please.// Amy: Great.// Dave: Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.// Amy: How ’bout Saturday?// Dave: Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers’ market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.// Scene: Howard’s workshop.// Raj: Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?// Howard: Really? Why?// Raj: They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.// Howard: Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?// Raj: Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…// Howard: Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?// Raj: It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.// Howard: That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.// Raj: But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.// Howard: All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together.// Raj: So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.// Howard: We did raise the roof that night.// Raj: Yeah, we totally did.// Howard: Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?// Sheldon (singing): Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.// Leonard: Put on some headphones.// Sheldon (singing): No they make my earlobes sweat.// Penny: Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?// Sheldon: There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.// Penny: Okay, great. What is it?// Sheldon: I’ll show you. (Into phone camera) Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn’t listen. Oh, wait. (Singing) Everyody cut footloose. Nope.// (Into phone camera)// Penny: I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.// Sheldon: This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.// Bernadette: So, you’re really going out with Dave again?// Amy: Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy.// Bernadette: But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.// Amy: That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again.// Bernadette: Okay. So where’s he taking you?// Amy: Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner.// Bernadette: Oh. That’s a big step.// Amy: It is?// Bernadette: Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live.// Amy: You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.// Bernadette: You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?// Amy: Why not?// Bernadette: ‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.// Raj: Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.// Howard: What should we write?// Raj: How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.// Howard: Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.// Raj: Well what do you want to write?// Howard: Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’.// Raj: Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now.// Howard: I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that.// Raj: Okay. I posted it.// Howard: So, who is this guy?// Raj: Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.// Howard: Cool name.// Raj: Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too.// Howard: Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.// Raj: He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon is playing his tune on a keyboard in the background.// Penny: Oh, my God, he won’t stop.// Leonard: How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?// Penny: Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?// Leonard: Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.// Penny: Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?// Leonard: What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.// Penny: Fine.// Leonard: I love you.// Penny: Who cares?// Sheldon (off): What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s mine. Why are you so strong?// (off)// Penny: Problem solved.// Leonard: Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.// Sheldon: Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.// Leonard: Hey, can we please get back to work?// Sheldon: This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.// Leonard: All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.// Sheldon: Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: Oh, no, he’s drinking it.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Howard: Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.// Raj: That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.// Bernadette: Who’s Trent?// Howard: Oh, he’s our fan.// Bernadette: Fan of what?// Howard: Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band.// Bernadette: You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?// Howard: And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.// Raj: Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.// Howard: Really? You want to go down there and meet him?// Bernadette: Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.// Raj: It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.// Howard: After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.// Raj: From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.// Howard: So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy.// Bernadette: Maybe I should marry Trent.// Raj: Yeah, like she could get Trent.// Dave: This is delicious.// Amy: Thank you.// Dave: Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.// Amy: When you were married, did your wife cook?// Dave: Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.// Amy: So, a little silver lining.// Dave: I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?// Amy: Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know.// Dave: I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.// Amy: Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.// Dave: Had to or got to? Sorry.// Amy: My fault. I brought him up.// Dave: Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?// Sheldon: Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?// Leonard: That’s a trick question, right?// Sheldon: Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.// Penny: Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems.// Leonard: Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.// Sheldon: Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.// Penny: Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.// Sheldon: The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride.// (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys)// Leonard: There goes our shot at him living on the roof.// Scene: A coffee shop.// Raj: So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?// Howard: No. Let him spot us.// Raj: I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.// Howard: Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.// Raj: And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!// Howard: I can’t watch.// Raj: It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done.// Howard: Why is he looking at it?// Raj: Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?// Howard: Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah.// Raj: Ooh!// Howard: Let’s just go.// Trent: Hey, aren’t you the guys?// Howard: Nope.// Raj: No, never heard of ’em!// Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is listening to Darlin’// Sheldon: I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.// Leonard: I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.// Penny: Do you even like the Beach Boys?// Sheldon: They have beach right in the name. What do you think?// Leonard: Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?// Sheldon: Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.// Penny: Why?// Sheldon: It’s about Amy.// Penny: Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.// Sheldon: It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”// Penny: She did soften your life, didn’t she?// Sheldon: Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.// Leonard: Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?// Penny: Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.// Leonard: Aw.// Amy: That’s an interesting tie clip.// Dave: Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.// Amy: No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.// Dave: Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.// Amy: No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous.// Dave: Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.// Amy: You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Amy: That’s Sheldon.// Dave: You’re kidding. How’s my hair?// Amy: Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time.// Sheldon: I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.// Amy: What?// Dave: If I may, I believe what he’s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don’t mind me.// Sheldon: I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.// Amy: No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?// Sheldon: Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.// Amy: I really want that, too.// Sheldon: Good. Because I love you.// Amy: I love you, too.// Dave: Kiss her, you brilliant fool.// Sheldon: Well, I’ll let you get back to your date.// Amy: Get back here.// Dave: Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.Series 09 Episode 11 – The Opening Night Excitation// Caption: A short time ago in an apartment in Pasadena….// Caption: THE BIG BANG THEORY// Caption: EPISODE 194// Caption: THE OPENING NIGHT EXCITATION// Caption: It is a period of great tension. Our heroes, Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Koothrappali know that tickets to the new Star Wars movie are about to be available for pre-sale.// Caption: If they fail in their mission and can’t see it on opening night Sheldon has sworn that they will never hear the end of it for the rest of their lives…// Caption: They believe him.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Guys, tickets already went on sale.// Sheldon: What?// Howard: They’re not supposed to be available yet.// Leonard: I don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale.// Raj: Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?// Leonard: No, it’s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.// Sheldon: The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in.// Leonard: Yeah, me, too.// Howard: Same here!// Raj: Guys, they’re gonna sell out.// Howard: What are we gonna do?!// Sheldon: All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist.// Howard: Got ’em.// Sheldon: And I will continue to do so!// Credits sequence.// Penny: I’m really happy you and Amy are back together.// Sheldon: Oh, thank you.// Leonard: I’m also really happy, but I can’t pretend it’s for you. New Star Wars in three days.// Sheldon: Hey, Thursday can’t get here soon enough. I’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.// Penny: Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday.// Sheldon: And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed.// Penny: You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.// Leonard: I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.// Sheldon: But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise, she’s even older. Who saw that coming?// Penny: Aw, that’s nice. Put that on her cake.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Arthur: Oh, great. This again.// Sheldon: Arthur, what brings you back?// Arthur: Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn’t a, a sex dream.// Sheldon: In the past, you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma.// Arthur: And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What’s, what’s troubling you?// Sheldon: Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.// Arthur: Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?// Sheldon: Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.// Arthur: And they, they, they don’t wear underwear.// Sheldon: So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?// Arthur: Uh, do, do you love this girl?// Sheldon: Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.// Arthur: Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.// Sheldon: By seeing the movie she’d want me to see?// Arthur: Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.// Sheldon: You’re right.// Arthur: Great.// Sheldon: Where are you going?// Arthur: I don’t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.// Scene: Amy’s bedroom.// Amy (answering phone): Sheldon, what’s wrong?// (answering phone)// Sheldon: I wanted to let you know I’ll be spending your birthday with you.// Amy: Okay.// Sheldon: See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.// Amy: Obi-what?// Sheldon: I’ll, I’ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.// Amy: Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?// Sheldon: It’s late. Got to go. Bye.// Raj: Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.// Leonard: I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.// Howard: Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together. (all laugh)// (all laugh)// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?// Sheldon: No, I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy.// Leonard: You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.// Sheldon (to Howard): This is my ticket to Star Wars….// (to Howard)// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Bernadette: What happens if I say, come in?// Penny: Well, find out.// Bernadette: Come in.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.// Penny: Come in.// Sheldon: Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.// Bernadette: Just come in.// Sheldon: For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I’ll stream it on Netflix.// Penny: We’re sorry. What do you need?// Sheldon: Well, as you know, I’ll be celebrating Amy’s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.// Bernadette: Sure.// Sheldon: Well, so far, I’ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.// Penny: Wow. You can really arrange that?// Sheldon: Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it’s your birthday at Bennigan’s, they make a fuss. I don’t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.// Bernadette: How about something a little more realistic?// Sheldon: Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.// Penny: Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.// Bernadette: Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.// Sheldon: No, no, no, no. She’d be going alone. Well, if you think I’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.// Penny: Okay, well, what’s the third option?// Sheldon: That I have coitus with her.// Scene: The comic book store.// Leonard: What do you think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart?// Raj: I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?// Howard: It’s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.// Leonard: He’s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?// Stuart: My, uh, my doctor’s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?// Leonard: Well…// Wil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.// Howard: Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?// Wil: Absolutely.// Stuart: Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.// Penny: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s, let’s just recap our options. All right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing.// Bernadette: Wild thang.// Sheldon: Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left.// Penny: Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.// Bernadette: Yeah, are you ready for this?// Sheldon: Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.// Penny: Sheldon, that’s so beautiful.// Sheldon: Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.// Scene: The stairwell.// Amy: Thanks for taking me out.// Penny: Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?// Bernadette: So where do you want to go?// Amy: I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.// Penny: Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.// Amy: Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?// Penny: Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought.// Amy: I think I’ll just stick to Mexican.// Bernadette: Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.// Amy: Okay, what is going on?// Penny: Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.// Amy: What surprises?// Bernadette: We don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he’s ready to be physical.// Amy: You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?// Penny: Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.// Amy: I, I can’t believe it. I, I don’t know what to say.// Bernadette: Well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…// Amy: I do know what to say. Let’s get me waxed.// Arthur: Why isn’t it ever Angie Dickinson’s bedroom?// Sheldon: You’re back.// Arthur: It, it doesn’t seem like it’s up to me.// Sheldon: I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I’ve never done that before.// Arthur: Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.// Sheldon: So, can you help me?// Arthur: Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…// Sheldon: Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.// Arthur: Oh, good, good. ‘Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.// Sheldon: I think they say junk.// Arthur: What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?// Sheldon: This is an important night for us, and I’m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.// Arthur: Sheldon, if, if you’re with the right person, it, it’ll be okay.// Sheldon: Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.// Arthur: Well, that’s, that’s very nice of you to say, but I think I’m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.// Sheldon: Oh, sure. Well, you’re fun to look at.// Raj: Tonight’s the night.// Leonard: Yeah, the wait is finally over.// Penny: I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it.// Howard: Ready to go?// Raj: Let’s do this.// Penny: Have fun, guys.// Leonard: We will.// Raj: I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.// Howard: I know.// Leonard: We’re gonna have so much more fun than him.// Bernadette: No, they’re not.// Penny: Knowing them, they will.// Scene: The cinema.// Howard: T minus 15 minutes.// Raj: Oh, did you hear from Wil?// Leonard: Yeah, he’s on his way. Time for bladder check.// Raj: Check.// Leonard: Check.// Howard: Check. Wait. Screw it. I’m holding it.// Raj: What is everyone booing at?// Wil: Hey, guys. What’s up?// Leonard: Um, hey, Wil. What you doin’?// Wil: I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.// Man: Star Trek stinks!// Wil: Yeah? Live long and suck it.// Scene: Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl.// Amy: Come in.// Sheldon: Oh.// Amy: Hi, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Hello. Sorry I’m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.// Amy: That’s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I’ll, I’m gonna go put these in water.// Sheldon: Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.// Amy: Do you like it?// Sheldon: It’s kind of spooky.// Amy: I can change it back.// Sheldon: No, no, no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I’ll be fine.// Amy: So, what’d you have in mind for tonight?// Sheldon: I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.// Amy: Um, that sounds nice, but I’m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.// Sheldon: Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.// Amy: You mean before you give it to me?// Sheldon: Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?// Amy: Of course.// Sheldon: Why are we saying give it to you like that?// Amy: Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.// Sheldon: I see. Is that all right? I’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I’m gonna need verbal consent.// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.// Leonard: So, if you don’t like Star Wars, why are you here?// Wil: Oh, I’m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie’s bad, it’s gonna ruin their lives.// Raj: Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me.// Wil: See? That’s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn’t gonna change at all.// Howard: He’s right.// Leonard: Yeah. No matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.// Bernadette: Do you think Sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?// Penny: I don’t know. He said he’s ready.// Bernadette: Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.// Penny: Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.// Amy: Hi.// Amy: So, um, should I get under the covers with you?// Sheldon: All right. Hello.// Sheldon: Why are you shaking? Are you cold?// Amy: I’m just, um, really nervous.// Sheldon: Why?// Amy: Well, I’ve been waiting for this for so long, I’ve just built it up in my head. I don’t know what to expect.// Sheldon: Neither do I. But we can find out together.// Leonard: I’m really nervous.// Howard: I know. We’ve been waiting so long for this.// Raj: And we’ve built it up in our heads so much.// Wil: Guys, it’s just a movie.// Leonard: That’s true.// Raj: It is.// Wil: Although, we all remember Jar Jar.// Raj: Leonard, I, I’m scared again.// Caption: A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away….// Sheldon: Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.// Amy: Me, too.// Sheldon: I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.// Amy: That works for me.// Wil: I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.// Raj: I don’t think I can walk right now.// Arthur: Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?// Sheldon: Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don’t think I need any more advice.// Arthur: I, I was just curious. How, how’d it go?// Sheldon: Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.// Arthur: But, uh, what, what about Amy?// Sheldon: Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn’t have the history with the franchise I do.// Arthur: Okay. Good, good talk.Series 09 Episode 12 – The Sales Call Sublimation// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: I’m glad to see you made it safely. How’s your hotel?// Amy (on Skype): It’s not the best Best Western I’ve been to, but I’d say it’s the third best Best Western I’ve been to.// (on Skype)// Sheldon: I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.// Amy: What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?// Sheldon: Mm, that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle.// Amy: Okay, well, I should unpack.// Sheldon: All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.// Amy: I will. I wish you were here.// Sheldon: At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.// Amy: Okay, I’m glad you’re not here?// Sheldon: Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.// Amy: Good-bye, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means I’m available to be entertained, hmm. As today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?// Howard: Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.// Sheldon: That sounds awful. Raj?// Raj: Uh, I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me.// Sheldon: That’s the one to beat. Leonard?// Leonard: Oh, if anything, I’m trying to get my Sheld-off.// Sheldon: Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.// Raj: Well, I should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.// Sheldon: Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.// Credits sequence.// Penny: Hey.// Leonard: Hey.// Raj: Hello.// Howard: Hi.// Leonard: How was your day?// Penny: Oh, not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr. Gallo.// Sheldon: A doctor? Well, I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes.// Penny: I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to get in for months.// Leonard: Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?// Penny: Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know.// Howard: What kind of doctor is she?// Penny: Um, a psychiatrist. Why?// Howard: Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you’ll get to talk to her.// Penny: Yeah, they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.// Raj: Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?// Penny: That’s interesting.// Leonard: I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?// Raj: Low self-esteem.// Howard: Social anxiety.// Sheldon: Sexual insecurity.// Leonard: None of that is true.// Penny: Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.// Leonard: That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?// Penny: I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug.// Leonard: What if I get caught?// Howard: Fear of failure.// Raj: Lack of confidence.// Sheldon: Kind of a wuss.// Leonard: Fine, I’ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.// Penny: Thank you.// Raj: Pushover.// Howard: Spineless.// Sheldon: Still hasn’t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Howard: That was incredible.// Bernadette: It was. I just wish Stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.// Howard: I know. It’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.// Stuart (knocking): You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?// (knocking): Y// Howard: What is it, Stuart?// Stuart: Can I come in?// Howard: Hang on. Should I send him away?// Bernadette: No, it’s okay.// Stuart: Thanks, Bernie.// Howard: What’s up?// Stuart: Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I’d make it easy on you guys and find my own place.// Howard: Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.// Bernadette: So, when are you thinking of moving?// Stuart: Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.// Bernadette: Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?// Stuart: Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.// Bernadette: : You’re very welcome.// Stuart: Hmm.// Howard: What?// Stuart: Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you’re awake.// Scene: The telescope room.// Sheldon: What are you doing?// Raj: Uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.// Sheldon: Hmm. What are you doing now?// Raj: Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.// Sheldon: Oh, I see. How about now?// Raj: Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.// Sheldon: Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.// Raj: Fine, you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.// Sheldon: Yep, I’m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.// Raj: Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.// Sheldon: Found one.// Raj: No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.// Sheldon: But, look, an optical transient.// Raj: Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?// Sheldon: It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?// Raj: No.// Sheldon: Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.// Scene: Dr Gallo’s office.// Leonard: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.// Dr Gallo: Ah, it’s my pleasure. I’m curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?// Leonard: Uh, she’s my mother. You know her?// Dr Gallo: No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.// Leonard: Well, then you know her better than I do.// Dr Gallo: Well, I’m not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.// Leonard: Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?// Dr Gallo: Well, I didn’t want to say it.// Leonard: No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.// Dr Gallo: Sounds like you’re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.// Leonard: Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now.// Dr Gallo: Mm. Good for you.// Leonard: Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?// Dr Gallo: That’s heartbreaking.// Leonard: Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Howard: You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.// Bernadette: Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.// Stuart: Boy, who would’ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I’d still be here two years later?// Howard: No one.// Bernadette: Nobody thought that.// Stuart: Well, that’s it.// Bernadette: I guess so.// Stuart: This is weird.// Howard: Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.// Bernadette: Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is.// Stuart: It’s okay. I know he loves me.// Bernadette: Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in.// Stuart: I will. And I really can’t thank you guys enough.// Bernadette: Our pleasure.// Stuart: Bye.// Bernadette: Goodbye.// Howard: He’s gone. Let’s start in the garage.// Raj: Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found.// Sheldon: Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation.// Raj: It could be a trans-Neptunian object.// Sheldon: Maybe it’s a new planet.// Raj: Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.// Sheldon: Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I’ll be happy.// Raj: Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…// Sheldon: Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.// Raj: A medium-sized asteroid.// Sheldon: That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.// Raj: I kind of like chicken fingers.// Sheldon: Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.// Raj: Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.// Sheldon: I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.// Raj: You dream different than me.// Sheldon: It is kind of cute.// Raj: Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.// Sheldon: We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours.// Leonard: Hi.// Penny: Hey, how’d it go?// Leonard: Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…// Penny: Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?// Leonard: Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.// Penny: You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.// Leonard: All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you.// Penny: Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.// Leonard: So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?// Penny: I guess.// Leonard: Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.// Scene: Stuarts former bedroom in Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?// Howard: No kidding. Oh, okay, I’m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?// Bernadette: Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?// Howard: Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.// Bernadette: Why can’t it be a woman cave?// Howard: As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.// Bernadette: I’m being serious.// Howard: Well, what do you think we should do?// Bernadette: I don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.// Howard: Oh. He was so excited.// Bernadette: Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.// Howard: I’ll give it to him next time I see him.// Bernadette: Have you heard from him since he left?// Howard: No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.// Bernadette: Hmm. Maybe he’s busy.// Howard: Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?// Bernadette: No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?// Howard: Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.// Bernadette: And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.// Howard: That was pretty cute.// Bernadette: Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!// Raj: So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.// Sheldon: That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.// Raj: How is that both our names?// Sheldon: Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.// Raj: Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?// Sheldon: Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb.// Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.// Leonard: Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself.// Sheldon: Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.// Leonard: Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.// Raj: I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.// Sheldon: Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.// Raj: Wait, what happened to us?// Sheldon: Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid.// Leonard: Well, what are you thinking of naming it?// Sheldon: I haven’t settled on anything yet.// Raj: We haven’t settled on anything yet.// Sheldon: All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.// Leonard: You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.// Raj: That is a great idea.// Sheldon: It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever.// Raj: So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?// Sheldon: I like it. Yeah, we’ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.// Raj: That’s just Amy.// Sheldon: Exactly. See how well we work together?// Scene Dr Gallo’s office.// Penny: And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.// Dr Gallo: Got it.// Penny: Uh, do you have any questions?// Dr Gallo: Just one.// Penny: Mm-hmm?// Dr Gallo: When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?// Penny: I just meant a question about the drug.// Dr Gallo: Yeah, I know what you meant. Let’s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.// Penny: I don’t wanna.// Dr Gallo: Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he’s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?// Penny: You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.// Amy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?// Sheldon: Good news. You’re an asteroid.// Amy: Uh, please tell me what to say next.// Sheldon: Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.// Amy: Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?// Sheldon: Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.// Amy: All of them?// Sheldon: Even the girls.// Amy: Okay, I think I know what to say now.// Penny: How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?// Dr Gallo: I went to college in the ’70s. It was a hairier time. I’m gonna say yes.// Penny: You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.// Dr Gallo: Hmm.// Penny: And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.// Dr Gallo: Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn’t sure if he was real.// Penny: Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.// Dr Gallo: Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.// Penny: I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping.// Dr Gallo: Oh, I’m glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.// Penny: Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.// Amy (on Skype): I miss you.// Sheldon: I miss you as well.// Howard: I can’t believe I miss Stuart.// Penny: I guess I just miss when life was simpler.// Scene: A street. Leonard is skipping ropes with some young girls.// Girls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!// Leonard: Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.// Girls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are asleep.// Stuart: I really miss this.//  Series 09 Episode 13 – The Empathy Optimisation// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?// Bernadette: Maybe he uses Kryptonite.// Emily: Well, Batman’s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.// Penny: No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man.// Leonard: What is happening?// Howard: I don’t know.// Raj: But it’s beautiful.// Penny: And now Ben Affleck is Batman?// Emily: Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.// Penny: Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night.// Bernadette: We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.// Penny: Oh, I love me some Leo.// Leonard: And it’s gone.// Sheldon: Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better.// Leonard: Good for you.// Sheldon: My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.// Howard: Glad to hear it.// Sheldon: I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.// Raj: Yay.// Sheldon: Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.// Penny: You really don’t know why?// Sheldon: No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.// Leonard: Let me refresh your memory.// Flashback// Sheldon: Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.// Penny: Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.// Sheldon: Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.// Bernadette: I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.// Sheldon: I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke.// Howard: Hey, she came all the way here…// Bernadette: You’re gonna want to take these with food.// Raj: Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.// Sheldon: She’s a dermatologist.// Emily: I went to medical school.// Sheldon: Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.// Leonard: All right, here you go.// Sheldon: Leonard, I’m dying.// Leonard: You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.// Sheldon: I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.// Back to the present.// Sheldon: I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Amy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon.// (on Skype)// Sheldon: Hello.// Amy: Are you feeling any better?// Sheldon: Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason.// Amy: Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong.// Sheldon: You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?// Amy: Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.// Sheldon: I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?// Amy: Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended.// Sheldon: You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?// Amy: No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting.// Sheldon: You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.// Amy: Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I’m gonna go take pictures. Bye.// Scene: The comic book store.// Raj: Hey, Stuart.// Stuart: Hey. Where’s Sheldon? Still sick?// Leonard: No, he’s fine. We just needed a little break.// Stuart: Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.// Howard: He was being a jerk to everyone. Don’t take it personally.// Stuart: Oh, I’m on so many antidepressants, I couldn’t if I wanted to.// Raj: I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.// Leonard: I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.// Howard: You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.// Raj: Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, I’m in.// Howard: We should all take a trip or something.// Leonard: Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.// Howard: Bernie would love that.// Raj: Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.// Leonard: That sounds really fun.// Raj: Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.// Leonard: No.// Howard: No.// Leonard: So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.// Penny: Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?// Leonard: Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay.// Penny: Well, I’m in. When are we going?// Leonard: This weekend.// Sheldon: Oh, where are we going?// Leonard: Well, Vegas, but…// Sheldon: Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.// Leonard: That’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited.// Sheldon: Well, now, well, that’s hurtful.// Penny: Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there.// Sheldon: I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.// Leonard: Not this time.// Sheldon: Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz.// Leonard: He’s coming, too.// Sheldon: Well, then Raj and I will…// Leonard: Nope.// Sheldon: Very well. Stuart.// Leonard: Oh, great. Do that.// Sheldon: Ugh. Stuart.// Amy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon. What’s new?// Sheldon: Our friends are jerks, and I’m mad at all of them.// Amy: I said what’s new, but sure.// Sheldon: Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?// Amy: Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?// Sheldon: You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.// Amy: Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.// Sheldon: I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.// Amy: Who else’s side could you have been on?// Sheldon: I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?// Amy: Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.// Sheldon: Fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.// Amy: Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It’s called empathy. It’s something you could work on.// Sheldon: I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.// Amy: Great. Now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.// Sheldon: Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.// Amy: Glad I could help.// Sheldon: Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.// Amy: I feel so, so bad.// Sheldon: Hey, we’re both great at this.// Sheldon: Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it.// Leonard: Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen, you spoil it in advance.// Sheldon: Hey, if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry.// Leonard: Thank you. I appreciate that.// Sheldon: I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.// Leonard: Appreciate that, too.// Sheldon: Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?// Leonard: You’re still not coming.// Sheldon: What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong.// Leonard: Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come.// Sheldon: Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?// Leonard: Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come.// Sheldon: Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.// Leonard: Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.// Sheldon: My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?// Scene: Howard and Berndette’s house.// Sheldon: Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry.// Howard: Wow. I’m impressed.// Sheldon: No, no, no, wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute.// Howard: Apology accepted.// Bernadette: Forgiven, forgiven.// Sheldon: All right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.// Howard: Sheldon Cooper apologized to me// Bernadette: And he made it all better.// Scene: The apartment bathroom.// Sheldon: All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.// Penny: Can this wait?// Sheldon: I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.// Penny: Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.// Sheldon: Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?// Penny: Leonard.// Sheldon: You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry.// Stuart: Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.// Sheldon: And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.// Stuart: What trip to Las Vegas?// Sheldon: The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.// Stuart: Of course, I wasn’t invited.// Sheldon: That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Sheldon: Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.// Raj: Of course I do.// Sheldon: And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that.// Emily: Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?// Sheldon: Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…// Raj: Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.// Emily: Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.// Raj: Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it.// Emily: Why are you defending him?// Sheldon: I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.// Emily: Well, I don’t accept your apology.// Raj: What are you doing?// Emily: It’s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.// Raj: Fine, how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you’d stop.// Emily: Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.// Raj: No, come on, please don’t leave.// Sheldon: Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…// Emily: Don’t worry, you’re good.// Sheldon: I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more.// Penny: So, was the fight really bad?// Sheldon: No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.// Leonard: You think they’ll still go on the trip?// Sheldon: All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…// Leonard: They’re not going on the trip.// Penny: No.// Raj: What is wrong with you?// Sheldon: Look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.// Raj: You went to Emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.// Sheldon: That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.// All: No.// Penny: Is she okay?// Raj: Yeah, I calmed her down, but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going.// Howard: Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option.// Sheldon: Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.// Raj: That’s very mature of you.// Sheldon: Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth.// Penny: And there’s your next T-shirt.// Scene: The party bus.// Howard: Ooh, check out the stripper pole.// Bernadette: You know what that means.// Leonard: That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?// Raj: You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.// Bernadette: This is so cool.// Penny: Here’s some champagne.// Leonard: Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…// Sheldon: Aha.// Leonard: What are you doing?// Sheldon: My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.// Penny: You couldn’t give us just one weekend?// Stuart: I told him this was a bad idea.// Leonard: What do we do, kick them off?// Penny: If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.// Sheldon: Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.// Raj: Oh, God.// Sheldon: Emily, as I’m sure you know, I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.// Raj: You know, Sheldon…// Emily: Shh, let him finish.// Sheldon: So, for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future, I’m sorry.// Emily: Thank you.// Sheldon: Good. Then I’ll be leaving now.// Emily: Oh, it’s okay, Sheldon. Come with us.// Sheldon: Oh, that’s very kind of you. But I’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. Let’s go, Stuart.// Stuart: But I want to stay.// Sheldon: Stuart, now.// Emily: You know, I know he’s a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.// Penny: And now you see the problem.// Leonard: Come on, you pain in the ass.// Sheldon: That’s me. Bye, Stuart.// Stuart: Wait. I’m a pain in the ass, too.// Scene: Later on the party bus.// Sheldon: Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?// Emily: At the moment? No, not really.// Penny: Shake it, baby.// Bernadette: Ooh, work that thing.Series 09 Episode 14 – The Meemaw Materialisation// Scene: The foyer.// Sheldon: Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that’s the FBI.// Leonard: If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb.// Penny: Yeah.// Sheldon: Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.// Penny: What is that?// Sheldon: Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder.// Penny: Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.// Leonard: That someone has a name.// Sheldon: Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.// Leonard: Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.// Penny: I park fine.// Sheldon: Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!// Leonard: Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her.// Sheldon: Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The airport arrivals area.// Sheldon: That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.// Leonard: Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?// Sheldon: And that’s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is.// Leonard: Oh, that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology.// Sheldon: Oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.// Leonard: Same as when we lost you at the zoo.// Sheldon: Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart.// Leonard: Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.// Meemaw: Moon Pie.// Sheldon: Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.// Meemaw: I’m so happy to see you, too.// Sheldon: Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.// Leonard: Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.// Meemaw: Thank you.// Sheldon: No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four.// Meemaw: Is that nice to say to your friend?// Sheldon: It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.// Leonard: Can you please live with us forever?// Scene: The comic book store.// Howard: That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?// Raj: I’m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?// Howard: I’m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.// Raj: She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.// Girl: Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?// Raj: Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.// Girl: Which is probably why that movie sucks.// Howard: Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.// Raj: I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?// Girl: I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.// Howard: Oh, that’s what I said an hour ago.// Girl: Wow. You’ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?// Howard: You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.// Raj: It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Are you comfortable?// Meemaw: Very. It’s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.// Sheldon: You were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.// Amy: Hi. Nice to meet you.// Meemaw: Nice to meet you, too.// Amy: How was your trip?// Meemaw: Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.// Amy: That’s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon’s spot. You know, I don’t even get to sit there.// Sheldon: Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.// Amy: Can I have a tissue?// Meemaw: Of course.// Sheldon: Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man.// Meemaw: He’s been saying that since he was little. I still don’t know what it means.// Sheldon: Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready.// Meemaw: Oh, now don’t you go looking through my suitcase for presents.// Sheldon: If I did, would I find any?// Meemaw: Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.// Sheldon: That’s a risk I’m willing to take.// Amy: Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…// Meemaw: Okay, now let’s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.// Amy: S, s, si, size me up?// Meemaw: Sheldon’s mother may be okay with you, but I’m not so easy.// Amy: Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me.// Meemaw: Oh, you better hope so.// Sheldon: A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.// Meemaw: Oh, you’re welcome, Moon Pie.// Sheldon: Amy, why don’t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.// Raj: Oh, I see you’re reading Saga.// Girl: Yeah, I hear it’s pretty good.// Raj: It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.// Girl: I’ll take your word for it.// Howard: You should. He’s really looked.// Raj: I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.// Howard: Hi.// Girl: Claire.// Raj: Well, I’ve never seen you here before, Claire.// Claire: It’s my first time. I’m looking for inspiration for this movie I’m writing.// Howard: You’re a screenwriter?// Claire: Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.// Raj: Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.// Claire: You’re really a scientist?// Raj: Well, astrophysicist.// Claire: That’s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It’s animated sci-fi for kids.// Raj: Sure. I love animated movies.// Howard: He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.// Raj: Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.// Claire: Here’s my number. Give me a call, we’ll get together.// Raj: Yeah, great.// Claire: See ya.// Raj: Yeah, bye.// Howard: What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.// Raj: So?// Howard: So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?// Raj: I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.// Howard: Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?// Raj: I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.// Penny: Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?// Meemaw: Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey.// Sheldon: Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.// Meemaw: Thank you, Moon Pie.// Amy: I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?// Meemaw: ‘Cause he’s so nummy-nummy.// Leonard and Penny: She could just eat him up.// Sheldon: And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.// Meemaw: It’s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don’t.// Amy: Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar.// Sheldon: How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.// Amy: Well, now I know.// Sheldon: Yeah.// Meemaw: So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.// Penny: Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.// Meemaw: Oh. It’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.// Amy: I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.// Meemaw: That doesn’t bode well.// Amy: Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work.// Meemaw: Well, Leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard’s work is more of a hobby.// Leonard: That’s my best friend.// Amy: Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.// Meemaw: I appreciate your honesty, dear.// Amy: Thank you.// Meemaw: And here’s some more honesty. I don’t like you very much.// Amy: Well, maybe I don’t like you either.// Sheldon: Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s.// Amy: I think I should leave.// Sheldon: But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time.// Amy: The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this.// Meemaw: Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.// Amy: What ring?// Leonard: Maybe we should give them some privacy.// Penny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.// Amy: You have an engagement ring?// Sheldon: Yes.// Amy: Penny, did you know about this?// Penny: All right, let’s go.// Amy: When did you get an engagement ring?// Sheldon: My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.// Meemaw: Well, thank goodness for that.// Amy: Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?// Sheldon: Oh, I don’t think I could do that.// Meemaw: Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.// Sheldon: I’m gonna opt out of that one, too.// Amy: Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs.// Sheldon: All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?// Meemaw: You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.// Amy: Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.// Sheldon: Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Bernadette: Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her.// Raj: Just to help her with her screenplay.// Bernadette: Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad.// Howard: You weren’t there. He was really flirting.// Raj: Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.// Bernadette: I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.// Howard: Really? So it’s okay if I fl…// Bernadette: Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?// Raj: Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?// Howard: No. Never.// Bernadette: Absolutely.// Howard: What?// Bernadette: Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.// Howard: Fine. I had reservations about you, too.// Bernadette: No, you didn’t.// Howard: No, I didn’t.// Bernadette: Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out.// Howard: Me, too. And I think you’re even more beautiful than this rose.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.// Leonard: Did it?// Penny: Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Penny: Come in.// Leonard: Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?// Sheldon: No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.// Penny: Uh-oh.// Sheldon: Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?// Raj: All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship.// Howard: Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily.// Bernadette: Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.// Howard: And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.// Raj: I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.// Bernadette: You’re right. It could totally happen.// Claire (voice): Hello?// (voice)// Raj: Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.// Claire: Hey, what’s up? Figure out what time you’re free?// Raj: Actually, that’s why I’m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.// Claire: Okay. Good for you.// Raj: Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.// Claire: I didn’t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.// Raj: Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?// Claire: Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.// Raj: Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.// Claire: Sure, we had a vibe.// Raj: I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?// Bernadette: You still have a girlfriend.// Raj: Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.// Claire: Hang on. We’re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.// Raj: Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding.// Claire: Look, it’s just coffee. I’ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.// Raj: Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.// Claire: Great. I’ll text you.// Raj: Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.// Bernadette: Are you gonna tell Emily?// Raj: Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.// Howard: When are you gonna tell Emily?// Raj: He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.// Amy: Look, I know you think I’m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I’m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.// Meemaw: I know more than you think I do.// Amy: Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?// Meemaw: Young lady, if you think I don’t know what it’s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you’re wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband.// Amy: Really?// Meemaw: There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.// Amy: Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?// Meemaw: Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don’t want to see that happen again.// Penny: Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.// Sheldon: No, I wouldn’t.// Leonard: Just get in here.// Sheldon: Hello.// Penny: Go ahead.// Sheldon: Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.// Amy: Oh, Sheldon, thank you.// Sheldon: Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.// Meemaw: I did.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.// Leonard: He never disappoints, does he?// Amy: I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?// Sheldon: Well…// Penny: Say yes.// Meemaw: Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won’t stand in your way.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Amy: So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?// Meemaw: I suppose.// Sheldon: I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.// Raj: Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.// Claire: This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn’t too scary for children.// Fantasy seqeunce.// Raj: And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met.// Claire: Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?// Raj: I will.Series 09 Episode 15 – The Valentino Submergence// Scene: The cafeteria.// Sheldon: Gentlemen.// Leonard: Hey.// Raj: Hey.// Howard: Hello.// Sheldon: If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day, Amy and I’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags.

I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.// Howard: Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?// Raj: You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?// Howard: You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?// Leonard: Yeah, just get it over with.// Raj: Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?// Howard: No.// Leonard: Not really.// Sheldon: You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: So, you really gonna break up with her?// Raj: Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?// Penny: Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?// Leonard: I stopped counting at four.// Penny: All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.// Raj: Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.// Leonard: She meant Emily.// Penny: No, I, I really didn’t.// Scene: Emily’s apartment.// Emily: You’re seriously breaking up with me?// Raj: Yeah.// Emily: And you thought right before Valentine’s Day was a good time to do it?// Raj: You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj (on phone): Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?// (on phone)// Claire: Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.// Raj: But I just broke up with my girlfriend.// Claire: Right before Valentine’s Day? What an ass.// Raj: Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.// Raj: I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.// Leonard: Well, you were right, tears.// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.// Sheldon: I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.// Amy: People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around.// Sheldon: Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight.// Amy: What do you mean?// Sheldon: Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.// Amy: Oh. That is so sweet.// Sheldon: So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags.// Amy: Catchy.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Howard: I’m gonna check the temp on the tub.// Bernadette: Don’t make it too hot.// Howard: Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.// Bernadette: Look at that, you shaved it all.// Howard: You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?// Bernadette: Ew, really? Get it out.// Howard: How?// Bernadette: Uh, wish we had a skimmer.// Howard: Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen.// Bernadette: I don’t know how to turn off the jets.// Howard: Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer.// Scene: A restaurant.// Leonard: Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour.// Penny: An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.// Leonard: I know.// Penny: So what did you say?// Leonard: Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.// Penny: All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?// Leonard: Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?// Penny: Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?// Leonard: A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.// Penny: Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?// Leonard: I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?// Maitre d’: I’m afraid so.// Leonard: Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?// Maitre d’: Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?// Man: I did.// Leonard: Oh, I took care of it.// Amy: Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live.// Sheldon: Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…// Amy: And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…// Together: Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun With Flags.// Amy: Consider tonight’s episode a Valentine’s Day gift for you, our viewers.// Sheldon: It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else.// Amy: Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.// Sheldon: Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.// Amy: No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?// Raj (voice): What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?// (voice)// Amy: Rajesh?// Raj: Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?// Amy: I, I think it starts with good communication.// Sheldon: You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller.// Howard: I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much.// Bernadette: I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive.// Howard: Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?// Bernadette: No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it.// Howard: Well, how do we do that?// Bernadette: Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel.// Howard: Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check.// Bernadette: Anything else?// Howard: To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.// Scene: The restaurant.// Penny: This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’.// Leonard: What are you gonna say?// Penny: I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him.// Leonard: I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.// Penny: I’m still sleeping with you tonight.// Leonard: See if you can get a table by the window.// Penny: Hi there. What’s your name?// Maitre d’: Glen.// Penny: Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?// Maitre d’: Well, you know, Valentine’s Day.// Penny: Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…// Maitre d’: With all due respect, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do.// Penny: You don’t have to call me ma’am.// Maitre d’: Okay.// Penny: I mean, we’re basically the same age.// Penny: How old are you?// Maitre d’: I’m 21. How old are you?// Penny: Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here.// Leonard: What? Why?// Penny: Because I’m young. Let’s go.// Amy: Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.// Raj (voice): You really think so?// Sheldon: Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you.// Amy: Your friend is hurting.// Raj: No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.// Sheldon: I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.// Amy: Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.// Barry (voice): Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.// Raj: Kripke? Is that you?// Barry: Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.// Sheldon: Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.// Barry: Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?// Sheldon: I don’t see why not.// Bernadette: He’s eating. That’s a good sign.// Howard: You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.// Bernadette: He’s pretty cute.// Howard: He is. Should we name him?// Bernadette: It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?// Howard: Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.// Bernadette: Are you okay?// Howard: No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.// Bernadette: Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?// Howard: Poor judgement, obviously.// Bernadette: He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine.// Howard: How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Leonard: It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?// Penny: It is freaking amazing.// Leonard: Well, glad you’re feeling better.// Penny: I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.// Leonard: Is that a big deal?// Penny: Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?// Leonard: Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…// Penny: Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?// Leonard: Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.// Penny: Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.// Leonard: No, they’re not.// Penny: You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.// Leonard: Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.// Penny: Won’t make us any younger.// Leonard: Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.// Penny: Okay, like what?// Leonard: I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.// Amy: Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.// Sheldon: Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.// Raj: But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?// Amy: Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away.// Sheldon: And actually, it was three different men.// Barry: Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?// Amy: Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.// Barry: No, actuawwy, I’m stiw here.// Amy: Now?// Barry: Yup.// Amy: Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.// Raj: Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again.// Sheldon: Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.// Amy: I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…// Raj: Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents.// Amy: …spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.// Barry: Hey, I think I got cut off.// Amy: Hello, Kripke.// Barry: I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?// Leonard: Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.// Leonard: Are you actually gonna dance?// Leonard: Of course.// Penny: Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?// Leonard: No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.// Penny: Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.// Leonard: That sounds fun. When’s it start?// Penny: Midnight.// Leonard: Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.// Penny: Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.// Leonard: Oh, thank God.// Penny: Yes.// Howard: It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.// Bernadette: Oh, terrific.// Howard: It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me.// Bernadette: If you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested.// Howard: Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.// Bernadette: Oh, cut off his head? That’s where his little nose is.// Howard: He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.// Bernadette: Howie, this is just your hypochondria.// Howard: No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.// Bernadette: We’ll find another time to tell him I’m pregnant.// Raj (voice): I mean, this is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much.// Amy: It really can.// Sheldon: All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.// Raj: I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.// Amy: No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you’re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.// Sheldon: Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us.// Barry: Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.// Amy: I’m just gonna push all the buttons.// Sheldon: Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it.// Amy: Really?// Sheldon: Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.// Amy: So do I.// Sheldon: When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…// Leonard and Penny: Happy Valentine’s Day!// Leonard: We are young and fun.// Sheldon: I stand corrected. Fun.// Sheldon: Congratulations on a successful live show.// Amy: And a lovely Valentine’s Day.// Penny: Cleaning up is not young and fun.// Leonard: It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.// Sheldon: Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?// Amy: Interesting, and when would you use the singular?// Sheldon: I’m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.Series 09 Episode 16 – The Positive Negative Reaction// Following a “previously on” sequence.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: Morning.// Bernadette: Morning.// Howard: We? What is this?// Bernadette: I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.// Howard: Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.// Bernadette: What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?// Howard: Are you serious?// Bernadette: Yeah.// Howard: Are you sure?// Bernadette: Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…// Howard: Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents? We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall.// Bernadette: I know, it’s crazy.// Howard: It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before.// Bernadette: Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out.// Howard: But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid.// Bernadette: I don’t know, Howie.// Howard: Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.// Bernadette: Calm down, it’s gonna be okay.// Howard: How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?// Sheldon: Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?// Raj: Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.// Sheldon: Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Raj: Hey, bud.// Leonard: Ready to play when you are.// Howard: Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.// Raj: If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you’re the first one.// Leonard: What’s going on?// Howard: I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.// Leonard: What? Congratulations.// Raj: That’s so amazing.// Sheldon: Oh, no.// Leonard: Why oh, no?// Sheldon: Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?// Leonard: Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group.// Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?// Leonard: You’re the other baby.// Sheldon: Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?// Leonard: Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?// Sheldon: I guess we’ll call this a draw.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s patio.// Bernadette: So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…// Penny (reading text): Leonard says you’re pregnant.// (reading text)// Amy: What?// Penny: Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?// Bernadette: I’m pregnant.// Penny: Oh, my God, I can’t believe it.// Amy: This is so exciting.// Bernadette: Yeah, it’s all real exciting.// Penny: Are, are you not happy about this?// Bernadette: I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat.// Penny: No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.// Bernadette: Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.// Penny: Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.// Amy: I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.// Penny: Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.// Bernadette: You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.// Howard: I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own vegetables.// Leonard: Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.// Howard: And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?// Sheldon: Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much.// Raj: Well, he could bring the baby here.// Sheldon: Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.// Howard: Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?// Raj: I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.// Howard: A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now.// Raj: I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.// Howard: This isn’t a joke.// Raj: I wasn’t joking.// Leonard: It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.// Raj: Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.// Howard: You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now.// Leonard: Hey, you know what we should do?// Sheldon: All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?// Leonard: Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.// Amy: Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this.// Penny: Yeah, yeah, we should go out.// Bernadette: Where?// Penny: Uh, I don’t know, a bar?// Bernadette: Can’t drink.// Penny: We can, but all right.// Amy: Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?// Bernadette: Doctor said I can’t have sushi.// Penny: Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.// Bernadette: Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub.// Amy: Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t laugh either?// Scene: A bar.// Raj: I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…// Leonard: And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.// All: Cheers.// Howard: Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.// Sheldon: And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.// Howard: If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.// Leonard: There’s no reason you can’t.// Howard: That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.// Leonard: That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it.// Sheldon: Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.// Leonard: Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.// Sheldon: Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.// Scene: The same, later.// Howard: Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.// Leonard: How is that a new invention?// Howard: I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.// Raj: It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.// Sheldon: This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?// Leonard: The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.// Sheldon: That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?// Raj: Uh, it’s in the corner.// Sheldon: Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?// Raj: I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.// Leonard: Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.// Howard: Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.// Raj: They have that. It’s called Uber.// Howard: Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?// Leonard: Yeah. Why?// Howard: Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?// Leonard: Wow. I’ve never thought about that.// Howard: And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.// Raj: Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.// Leonard: You may have actually just come up with something.// Howard: You think so?// Leonard: I really do.// Sheldon: You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it.// Amy: Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.// Penny: Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.// Bernadette: I kind of already do that for Howie.// Penny: And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.// Amy: Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?// Bernadette: Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.// Penny: Oh, tell us.// Amy: Yeah, tell us.// Bernadette: No, I’m embarrassed.// Penny: Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.// Amy: Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it.// Bernadette: Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.// Amy: Oh, that sounds juicy.// Bernadette: Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…// Penny: Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?// Bernadette: Kind of on Sheldon’s bed.// Penny: No.// Bernadette: I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here.// Amy: How could you do that?// Bernadette: I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another.// Amy: I do know what that’s like. I really do.// Scene: The bar.// Leonard: I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.// Howard: I’m not finding anything either.// Raj: It’s a good sign.// Sheldon: Oh, wait, I found something.// Howard: Damn. What is it?// Sheldon: This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.// Leonard: Can you focus on what we’re talking about?// Sheldon: All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.// Raj: Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us.// Sheldon: And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?// Leonard: I’d enjoy that.// Sheldon: Nah, she’s a good kid.// Howard: If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.// Raj: Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.// Leonard: I’m telling you, you got this.// Howard: Maybe you’re right.// Sheldon: Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.// Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.// Sheldon: You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s hot tub.// Bernadette: You guys can go in if you want.// Penny: No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in.// Amy: Then why are we drinking?// Penny: Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right? (Checking text) Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.// (Checking text)// Bernadette: That sounds fun.// Amy: Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me.// Penny: What’s it say?// Amy: Would you like to sing karaoke with us.// Bernadette: How is that a drunk text?// Amy: He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted.// Raj (rapping): Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.// (rapping)// Leonard (singing): You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it// (singing)// Raj: Just bust a move,// Leonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it// Penny: Hey, guys. Congratulations.// Howard: Thank you.// Amy: Hi. How are you doing?// Sheldon: Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.// Howard: I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?// Bernadette: Sure.// Penny: So, you gonna get up there later?// Sheldon: A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.// Howard: I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I’m done being scared.// Bernadette: It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too.// Howard: Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also really excited. I mean it.// Bernadette: Me, too.// Howard: I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.// Penny (singing): Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’.// Amy (singing): We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?// Penny (singing): Say there’s another and look right in my eyes.// Amy (singing): My first love broke my heart for the first time.// Together: And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you’d always be mine.// Howard (singing): Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’.// Raj (singing): Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.// Leonard (singing): Ah, push it.// Bernadette: I appreciate this, but you really…// Leonard (singing): Push it real good.// Sheldon (singing): Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.// Howard: I’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. (Singing) Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me.// (Singing)// Sheldon: You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?// Howard: Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.// Penny: That was such a fun night.// Leonard: Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.// Penny: Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.// Leonard: Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.// Penny: Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.// Leonard: Me, too. So, you ever think about it?// Penny: Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?// Leonard: I think we’d make amazing parents.// Sheldon: Will you guys keep it down?// Penny: On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.Series 09 Episode 17 – The Celebration Experimentation// Scene: The stairwell// Amy: So Sheldon, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk about but I know it’s kind of a touchy subject.// Leonard: Way to narrow it down to everything.// Sheldon: What is it?// Amy: Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.// Sheldon: Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.// Amy: Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?// Penny: W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?// Leonard: Well, where’s that information been this whole time?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Well, where is he?// Amy: Sheldon?// Leonard: I’ll check his room.// Sheldon: Surprise.// Penny: Oh, my God.// Sheldon: Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.// Amy: I’m sorry I brought it up.// Penny: Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?// Sheldon: Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink.// Amy: But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.// Leonard: One day. Right.// Amy: Can you please just tell me why?// Sheldon: Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.// Amy: I’m sorry.// Sheldon: Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.// Penny: Oh, poor thing.// Sheldon: When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.// Amy: You realize none of those things would happen now?// Sheldon: I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?// Amy: Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.// Penny: You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.// Leonard: And we live here, so we have no choice.// Penny: Yeah.// Sheldon: Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.// Scene: The comic book store.// Howard: You have any idea what you’re getting Sheldon for his birthday?// Raj: He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.// Leonard: Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.// Howard: That’s funny. Let’s do that.// Leonard: Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.// Raj: You mean, some guy in a lame suit?// Leonard: Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?// Stuart: Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he’d get paid. And I wouldn’t tell him.// Leonard: Can I get his contact info?// Stuart: Sure, uh, but just so you know, he’s kind of a diva.// Leonard: He is?// Stuart: Oh, yeah. Won’t take the bus. He won’t pack his own lunch. Won’t let you spend the night on his couch.// Amy: Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?// Sheldon: Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.// Penny: All right, what about music?// Sheldon: I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.// Penny: No music it is.// Bernadette: What kind of cake do you like?// Sheldon: Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Raj: Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?// Leonard: Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.// Raj: You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.// Howard: Don’t say that to him.// Raj: What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.// Leonard: Don’t say that to anyone.// Penny: Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.// Stuart: Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don’t always feel like I’m part of the group.// Penny: Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?// Barry: Hewwo, I hope I’m not too earwy.// Bernadette: No, no, no. Come on in.// Barry: And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?// Bernadette: Doing great.// Stuart: You, you’re pregnant?// Bernadette: Yeah.// Stuart: Sounds like something a member of the group might know.// Penny: Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.// Leonard: Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?// Adam West: Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale’s overrated.// Raj: Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.// Adam: Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.// Howard: Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman.// Adam: I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar’s bungalow.// Leonard: I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale.// Adam: There’s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.// Howard: Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?// Leonard: Sure.// Raj: Yeah, of course.// Adam: What’s an Affleck?// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Sheldon: Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?// Amy: Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.// Sheldon: But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?// Amy: Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.// Sheldon: Oh. Thank you.// Amy: Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.// Sheldon: But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.// Leonard: So, Mother, I’m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday.// Beverley: Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.// Leonard: Oh. You had a party for your 60th?// Beverley: Oh, I wouldn’t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.// Penny: You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her.// Beverley: And I never did thank you for that, dear.// Amy: Oh. Penny says everyone’s there. Are you ready?// Sheldon: I am. Oh. Wait.// Amy: Are you all right?// Sheldon: No, I just, I got a little light-headed.// Amy: Oh, do you need a minute?// Sheldon: No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.// All: Happy birthday!// Leonard: Speech! Speech!// Raj: Come on, Sheldon, say something.// Sheldon: Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.// Leonard: Batman finally came to your party.// Adam: Happy birthday, Sherman.// Sheldon: Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.// Adam: I still get paid, don’t I?// Scene: A little later.// Leonard: Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him.// Amy: Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?// Leonard: No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time.// Amy: Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on.// Leonard: Again, no offence, but so have I.// Amy: Well, he’s seen me without pants on.// Leonard: Again, no…// Penny: Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come in?// (Knocking)// Sheldon: How do you know I’m not using the facilities?// Penny: Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what’s going on?// Sheldon: I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.// Penny: I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.// Sheldon: I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.// Penny: Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.// Sheldon: I don’t think I can go back out there.// Penny: That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.// Sheldon: Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it.// Penny: My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you.// Sheldon: Well, everyone will think I’m weird.// Penny: Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re all still here because they care about you so much.// Barry (knocking): Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard’s mother.// (knocking):// Scene: Later.// Leslie Winkle: Leonard.// Leonard: Hey.// Leslie: It’s been a while.// Leonard: Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.// Leslie: Has it?// Leonard: Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.// Leslie: Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you’d be living with Sheldon forever.// Leonard: Yeah, well, don’t be a stranger.// Penny: Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?// Barry: What are you wooking at me for? I’m a saint. But a sinner in the sack.// Sheldon: Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.// Amy: If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.// General cheers.// Sheldon: Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.// Howard: Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…// Sheldon: Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.// Howard: Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.// Sheldon: Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.// Wil: Sheldon, I know that we’ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.// Sheldon: That’s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s famous and you’re not.// Beverley: Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can’t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.// Barry: Someone caw Animal Contwol. There’s a cougar on the woose.// Beverley: Barry, stop.// Leonard: Seriously, Barry, stop.// Raj: And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.// Sheldon: And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.// Leslie: Uh, in the past, I would’ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I’m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it’s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.// Leslie: Happy birthday, dumbass.// Adam: Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I’m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…// Bernadette: I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.// Howard: What? You gotta be kidding me?// Leonard: Sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Leonard: Happy birthday, buddy.// Sheldon: Thank you. That, that was wonderful.// Penny: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.// Stuart: Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I’ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone…// Amy: Hey, everybody, listen up.// Penny: You nailed it.// Amy: We’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.// Stephen Hawking (on Skype): Hello, Sheldon.// (on Skype)// Sheldon: Professor Hawking.// Stephen: Happy birthday to you.// Sheldon: Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…// Sheldon: Oh, you’re singing. Well, I’m sorry.// Stephen: Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.// Leonard: Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.// Stephen: I was crushing it, but all right.// Penny: Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.// Sheldon: You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating.// Leonard: Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.// Stephen: And a one, and a two…// All: Happy birthday to you,// Happy birthday to you,// Happy birthday, dear Sheldon,// Happy birthday to you.// Adam: So, who’s taking me home?Series 09 Episode 18 – The Application Deterioration// Following a “previously on” sequence.// Scene: Outside the University legal office.// Howard: Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?// Sheldon: I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.// Howard: Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?// Sheldon: Yeah, well, you’re an engineer. End of joke, burn.// Attorney: Come on in, fellas.// Howard: See, he’s not wearing a tie.// Leonard: Well, he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.// Attorney: So, I’ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we’ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.// Sheldon: That’s great.// Howard: Excellent.// Leonard: So what happens next?// Attorney: Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.// Howard: Oh, I don’t think there will be.// Leonard: Yeah, we did our own search.// Attorney: That’s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.// Sheldon: Get a load of this guy.// Howard: Can you imagine if we make money with this?// Leonard: If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.// Howard: That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.// Attorney: Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.// Howard: Seventy-five percent?// Sheldon: That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?// Attorney: It’s university policy.// Sheldon: I know when I’m beat.// Leonard: Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?// Attorney: Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?// Leonard: Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.// Attorney: And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I’m afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you’re not entitled to an ownership share.// Howard: Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?// Attorney: Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.// Sheldon: Well, that’s not fair. We should all get plaques.// Leonard: Sorry, but we can’t sign this.// Howard: Come on, let’s go.// Leonard: Thank you for your time.// Sheldon: Couple of questions about the plaque.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Amy: So, have you been having any morning sickness?// Bernadette: A little. And it doesn’t help that I’ve got this heightened sense of smell.// Penny: Is that a pregnancy thing?// Bernadette: Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.// Penny: But now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.// Raj: Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do.// Penny: Oh, sure. Let me see it.// Amy: See what?// Raj: I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.// Penny: Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily.// Bernadette: That’s nice.// Penny: Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?// Raj: I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?// Amy: Why wouldn’t you open it?// Raj: Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.// Bernadette: You don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?// Penny: I know one way to find out. Sniff this.// Amy: She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound.// Bernadette: Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it’s metal.// Penny: Come on, just open it.// Raj: You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.// Penny: Well, never hurts to have a spare.// Bernadette: What is that?// Raj: Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.// Amy: What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.// Raj: I know, she’s so thoughtful.// Penny: See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.// Raj: You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.// Amy: You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?// Howard: We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.// Sheldon: Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.// Leonard: Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all.// Howard: Either way, I get nothing.// Leonard: Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.// Sheldon: To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.// Howard: I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?// Leonard: Of course, we can split any profits three ways.// Sheldon: I’m fine with that.// Howard: Okay, great.// Sheldon: It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.// Leonard: Sure, we could write something up.// Sheldon: But which one of us should be the party who…// Howard: You can do it, Sheldon.// Sheldon: So stipulated.// Leonard: Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.// Bernadette: I wonder how much she spent on this.// Amy: Ooh, let’s find out.// Raj: It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.// Penny: Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?// Raj: Seriously, guys, I don’t want to know.// Amy: Oh, my.// Raj: Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me.// Amy: These things go for five hundred dollars and up.// Bernadette: Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.// Penny: Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?// Raj: Maybe you’re right.// Bernadette: Or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.// Raj: Maybe you’re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. (Phone rings) Oh, guys, it’s Emily. What should I do?// (Phone rings)// Penny: Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.// Raj: Hello?// Emily (voice): Hey, it’s Emily. Is this a good time?// (voice)// Raj: Yeah, yeah. Sure. What’s up?// Emily: Was it okay I left that gift? I’m really hoping we can be friends.// Raj: Maybe, maybe.// Emily: Um, you think you’d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?// Raj: I’m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.// Emily: I just, I miss hanging out with you. It’s not like I lost a friend, it’s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you’d want to come over?// Raj: I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea.// Emily: Okay. I’m just, I’m having a really hard time, but that’s not your problem, that’s mine. I, I won’t bother you again, but please know that you’ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You’re a good guy.// Raj: Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.// Penny: I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of you.// Raj: Well, anyway, I’ll leave you to your girls’ night.// Amy: Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?// Raj: No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.// Bernadette: Well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here.// Raj: Thank you.// Penny: Say hi to Emily for us.// Raj: Will do.// Howard: This contract looks good to me.// Sheldon: I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.// Leonard: I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.// Bernadette: I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?// Howard: Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.// Bernadette: What is it?// Howard: Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.// Penny: Sheldon, did you draft the contract?// Sheldon: You bet I did.// Penny: Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.// Bernadette: So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?// Sheldon: Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now.// Bernadette: I know, but…// Howard: Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.// Bernadette: Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.// Amy: Well, to be fair, Howard’s idea was based on Sheldon’s math.// Leonard: Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard’s invention, Sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now.// Penny: What?// Howard: Honey, this is fine.// Bernadette: If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.// Howard: Can I talk to you in the hall?// Bernadette: Sure.// Howard: Excuse us.// Sheldon: Hey, Leonard.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd.// Leonard: Good one.// Sheldon: Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.// Howard: What are you doing?// Bernadette: I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.// Howard: What’s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.// Bernadette: Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.// Howard: All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.// Bernadette: I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.// Howard: Here we go with the ironclad logic again.// Bernadette: You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?// Howard: Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that’s cheating.// Scene: Raj’s car.// Raj (answering phone): Hello?// (answering phone)// Claire: Hey, Raj. It’s Claire. How are you?// Raj: Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.// Claire: Really?// Raj: I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?// Claire: Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn’t work out.// Raj: Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.// Claire: So if you were still interested.// Raj: Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?// Claire: Uh, I’m almost off work. What are you doing now?// Raj: Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything.// Claire: Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn’t have her best friend to talk to any more?// Raj: That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?// Claire: I’m a girl. It’s, like, page one out of the playbook.// Raj: Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?// Leonard: They’ve been out there a while.// Amy: I hope everything’s okay.// Sheldon: I wonder what they’re talking about.// Penny: If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.// Howard: Hey.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: You guys all right?// Howard: Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.// Sheldon: Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.// Howard: Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It’s, it’s with how you treat me.// Sheldon: Well, I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.// Bernadette: Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?// Sheldon: No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.// Howard: See? This is what happens every time we work together.// Penny: You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?// Leonard: What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?// Penny: No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.// Bernadette: How would you enforce it?// Sheldon: Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.// Amy: And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.// Sheldon: Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow’s on my spot.// Leonard: Howard, what do you think?// Howard: I’m on board.// Sheldon: I’ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it’s addendum time.// Emily (voice): Hello?// Raj: Hey, Emily, listen, I’ve been thinking, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over.// Emily: Oh. Okay. I understand.// Raj: No, no. Please don’t cry.// Emily: Okay, I’ll stop.// fade// Claire: Hello?// Raj: Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…// Claire: Fine. Do what you want, but she’s playing you.// Raj: I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset.// Claire: You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I’m having such a rough day.// Raj: Emily, listen, I’m sorry, but I can’t come by.// Emily: Why not?// Raj: I think we both know if I come over, we’re gonna get back together and…// Emily: I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?// Raj: Call you right back.// Sheldon: The, the revisions I made start on page four.// Penny: Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.// Amy: You should see the Valentine’s Day card he gave me.// Howard: Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.// Leonard: Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.// Sheldon: Do you still like cilantro?// Leonard: Yeah.// Sheldon: You’re tying my hands here.// Howard: All right, let’s sign this.// Penny: Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?// Amy: Sheldon, what did you do?// Howard: I should’ve known.// Bernadette: 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that’s so nice.// Leonard: That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.// Howard: That’s very generous, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh, I’ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I’ve been of your contributions.// Howard: I appreciate that.// Sheldon: And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: What? I didn’t sign it yet.// Raj: I hear what you’re saying, but I’ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.// Claire: All right, it’s your life. But you know how this is gonna end.// Raj: As a matter of fact, I do. I’m gonna comfort her, because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.// Scene: Emily’s bed.// Raj: Good talk.Series 09 Episode 19 – The Solder Excursion Diversion// Scene: The apartment.// Amy (on Skype): I didn’t understand your e-mail.// (on Skype)// Sheldon: Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.// Amy: I didn’t understand your e-mail.// Sheldon: Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.// Amy: Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?// Sheldon: So, is that a yes?// Amy: Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that one’s out-of-date.// Sheldon: Oh, but I like this computer.// Amy: The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.// Sheldon: I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.// Sheldon: The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.// Amy: Get a new computer.// Sheldon: What?// Sheldon: What? (Answering phone) Hello?// (Answering phone)// Amy (on phone) Get a new computer.// (on phone)// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard’s workshop.// Leonard: This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?// Howard: Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.// Leonard: If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set.// Penny: Hey, guys.// Leonard: Hey. What are you doing here?// Bernadette: We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.// Penny: Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em.// Leonard: Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.// Penny: So, how’s it goin’?// Leonard: Good. Slow.// Howard: There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.// Penny: Is there anything we can do to help?// Leonard: You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could.// Penny: Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.// Bernadette: Can we really help?// Howard: While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.// Leonard: I’ll show you how to do one.// Penny: Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny.// Amy: I got here as quickly as I could.// Sheldon: You’re too late.// Amy: Sheldon, this is silly.// Sheldon: You got emotional when that lab monkey died.// Amy: That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.// Sheldon: Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.// Amy: Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.// Sheldon: How could you do that?// Amy: Do what?// Sheldon: Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I lost enough today?// Amy: Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.// Sheldon: Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?// Sheldon: Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?// Sheldon: Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.// Leonard: After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.// Penny: Like this?// Leonard: Yeah, perfect.// Penny: Oh.// Leonard: And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard.// Howard: I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.// Leonard: We had a full spool yesterday.// Howard: What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.// Bernadette: Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It’s like a beer commercial.// Leonard: Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.// Penny: How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?// Leonard: Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…// Penny: Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.// Howard: You want to come with us?// Bernadette: I’m kind of getting into the groove here.// Penny: Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.// Leonard: Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.// Penny: Okay, so what is solder?// Sheldon: I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?// Amy: Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.// Sheldon: You wouldn’t.// Amy: Whatch me.// Sheldon: Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.// Amy: I thought you might like it.// Sheldon: Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs.// Amy: Or you could just look into my eyes.// Sheldon: But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.// Amy: Well, you know, as long as you’re happy.// Sheldon: Oh. I am.// Amy: And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.// Sheldon: Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.// Amy: Oh, but he said you can get store credit.// Sheldon: Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit.// Amy: But why wouldn’t…// Sheldon: Can we please change the subject?// Amy: Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?// Sheldon: I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain.// Amy: Sheldon, just tell me.// Sheldon: It might be easier to show you.// Amy: Okay.// Sheldon: We’d have to take your car.// Amy: All right.// Sheldon: And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.// Amy: Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?// Scene: A street.// Leonard: Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.// Howard: Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?// Leonard: I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.// Man: Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?// Leonard: Oh. Sorry, we can’t.// Howard: Well, hang on. What movie is it?// Man: Oh, I can’t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.// Howard: Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out.// Leonard: What about the girls?// Howard: Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?// Leonard: Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.// Penny: I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.// Bernadette: It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.// Raj: Hey. Where are the guys?// Penny: Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.// Bernadette: Since when do you work on weekends?// Raj: I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.// Penny: You were home alone and had no one to play with?// Raj: Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?// Bernadette: Not with Lightning McQueen here.// Penny: I think we’re good.// Raj: Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So, see ya.// Bernadette: I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?// Raj (from outside): Yes.// (from outside)// Scene: Amy’s car.// Amy: Will you please tell me where we’re going?// Sheldon: Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis.// Amy: I’m driving the car. I need to know.// Sheldon: Right.// Amy: So where are we going?// Sheldon: No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.// Scene: The cinema.// Leonard: What are we gonna tell the girls?// Howard: It’s not a problem.// Leonard: I mean without lying.// Howard: And now you’ve made it a problem.// Leonard: Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.// Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text): Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.// (at Howard’s workshop, reading text)// Leonard: They bought it.// Howard: But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.// Leonard: Oh, you’re good at this.// Howard: Well, I lie a lot.// Man: Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You’re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.// Leonard: Hey, you were right.// Howard: Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.// Man: Uh, we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.// Leonard: Who are you texting?// Howard: Raj. He really wants to see this movie.// Leonard: He’ll never make it in time.// Howard: I know. I want to make him feel bad.// Leonard: Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend.// Raj (at the workshop): Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?// (at the workshop)// Penny: Why?// Raj: I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.// Bernadette: What’s going on?// Raj: Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.// Penny: Un-freakin’ believable.// Bernadette: Son of a bitch.// Raj: Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.// Penny: No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.// Bernadette: Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.// Penny: Mm-hmm.// Raj: Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.// Scene: A storage facility.// Amy: Why do you have a storage unit?// Sheldon: Just wait.// Amy: How long have you had it?// Amy: Do you want me to hold that computer?// Sheldon: Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.// Amy: I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?// Sheldon: It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.// Amy: All of it?// Sheldon: I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.// Amy: Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute.// Penny: All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?// Raj: I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.// Penny: Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?// Raj: No, ma’am.// Bernadette: Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.// Penny: Yeah, that’s pretty good.// Raj: I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either.// Scene: The storage unit.// Sheldon: In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.// Amy: You have sporting equipment?// Sheldon: Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.// Amy: Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?// Sheldon: I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.// Amy: So, why do you feel you need to save these things?// Sheldon: I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…// Amy: Okay. I get it. I get it.// Sheldon: It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me.// Amy: I don’t.// Sheldon: Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.// Amy: Why?// Sheldon: Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?// Amy: It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too.// Sheldon: Like what?// Amy: Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?// Sheldon: I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.// Amy: It’s not a contest.// Penny: Okay, here they come.// Bernadette: Go hide.// Raj: Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.// Leonard: Hey.// Howard: Hi.// Penny: Hey, what’s this?// Leonard: Listen, we did a stupid thing.// Howard: We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.// Leonard: So, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner.// Howard: Yeah. Anywhere you want.// Bernadette: Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.// Penny: Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.// Raj (inside cupboard): Don’t forgive them. Stay mad at them.// (inside cupboard)// Howard: What is he doing in there?// Raj: Busting you.// Bernadette: It’s okay. They apologized.// Penny: Yeah, it’s fine.// Raj: Well this is kind of anti-climactic.// Howard: You know what wasn’t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.// Raj: No spoilers. No spoilers.// Penny: And he’s back in the closet.// Howard: Ready for dinner?// Penny: Yeah.// Bernadette: Should we invite Raj?// Raj (in cupboard): Yes.// (in cupboard)// Amy: So, no one else knows about this?// Sheldon: Only you.// Amy: Thank you for trusting me.// Sheldon: What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?// Amy: That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for you.// Sheldon: Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.// Amy: Baby steps, I guess.// Sheldon: I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.// Amy: Oh. Okay.// Sheldon: I will always have the dent to remember it by.// Amy: You did it. Do you feel okay?// Sheldon: Actually, yes. I do.// Amy: Well, I’m proud of you.// Sheldon: Thanks.// Sheldon: I’m glad I told you about the storage unit.// Amy: Well, I feel closer to you now.// Sheldon: Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime.// Amy: What did you have in mind?// Scene: The same, shortly afterwards.// Sheldon: You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.// Amy (on Skype): I really had to go home for this?// Sheldon: Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room.// Amy: And yet, I’m not.// Sheldon: But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.// Amy: And yet, you can’t.// Sheldon: I know.Series 09 Episode 20 – The Big Bear Precipitation// Scene: The apartment (initially inside a virtual reality device)// Sheldon: It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!// Leonard: Whatcha doing?// Sheldon: I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.// Penny: What am I smelling?// Sheldon: Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.// Penny: That’s not what the forest smells like.// Sheldon: Well, how would I know?// Leonard: Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.// Sheldon: Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.// Leonard: Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.// Sheldon: Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.// Penny: Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?// Sheldon: You may need this more than I do.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Amy: Here’s your tea.// Sheldon: Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.// Amy: You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?// Sheldon: Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…// Penny: You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.// Leonard: Because he’s hitting on you?// Penny: She.// Leonard: Oh, good.// Penny: But I could get her.// Amy: We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun.// Sheldon: Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.// Leonard: You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.// Penny: Sure.// Amy: Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them.// Sheldon: I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.// Penny: I’ll see if it’s available.// Amy: You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.// Sheldon: Are you trying to manipulate me?// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: Well done, it worked, we’re going.// Amy: Yay.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: Come on, Raj, give me a bag.// Raj: No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.// Howard: Hey, where you been?// Bernadette: Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.// Howard: Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?// Bernadette: Yes and yes.// Howard: I didn’t know you needed help running errands today.// Bernadette: I didn’t, but Raj volunteered.// Howard: Really?// Bernadette: Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me.// Howard: Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet.// Raj: Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think.// Howard: And it just got weird.// Penny: Hey. Amy’s downstairs.// Leonard: Okay, one sec.// Penny: Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?// Leonard: I bought a baseball cap.// Penny: I can see that. What team did you get?// Leonard: Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.// Penny: Well, we’ll be in the woods.// Sheldon: I’m ready to go.// Leonard: Anything you’d like to say to him?// Penny: Nice hat, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Thanks.// Leonard: Why are you so mean to me?// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen. Screams are emanating from Bernadette’s tablet.// Howard: What the hell are you watching?// Bernadette: Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.// Howard: Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?// Bernadette: I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.// Howard: All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?// Bernadette: Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat.// Howard: Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?// Bernadette: Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.// Howard: So he can be part of the experience?// Bernadette: Yeah.// Howard: I’m surprised he let us conceive without him.// Bernadette: It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Penny: It’s so cute and rustic up here.// Leonard: I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.// Sheldon: Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time.// Amy: Have you ever been off the grid before?// Sheldon: Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.// Leonard: I was afraid he was gonna eat me.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.// Howard: Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.// Bernadette: Leave it alone. He means well.// Howard: So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?// Bernadette: No, not really.// Howard: And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?// Bernadette: He’s just trying to be supportive.// Howard: Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?// Bernadette: No.// Raj: Hello.// Bernadette: You saw him carrying that.// Howard: Astronauts saw him carrying that.// Scene: The cabin.// Penny: This place is great.// Leonard: So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.// Penny: Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.// Sheldon: Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?// Amy: Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?// Amy: On the other hand, safety first.// Scene: The same, later.// Amy: Wow, it’s really coming down.// Penny: This sucks.// Leonard: And there goes our hike.// Sheldon: Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.// Penny: You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us.// Leonard: Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?// Penny: No.// Leonard: You’ll wish it would kill you.// Amy: So what do we do now?// Leonard: They have some board games.// Sheldon: Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.// Penny: Hey, let’s light a fire.// Amy: Ooh, that sounds cozy.// Leonard: I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.// Sheldon: Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out.// Leonard: I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.// Sheldon: That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.// Leonard: Right. So all we need is to…// Penny: Got it.// Leonard: A scientist made that.// Howard: Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.// Raj: Please, my pleasure.// Bernadette: And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.// Howard: But we have to set some boundaries.// Raj: I don’t understand.// Howard: The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us.// Howard: Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off.// Howard: Thanks for understanding.// Raj: Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.// Howard: You need some help?// Raj: No, I got it.// Bernadette: Raj, Raj, wait.// Raj: Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.// Penny: Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?// Sheldon: Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.// Penny: Not the drinking game, a drinking game.// Leonard: To be fair, good at both.// Amy: What’s the game?// Penny: All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.// Leonard: I’ve never played that before.// Sheldon: Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?// Penny: Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…// Amy: She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.// Penny: Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back.// Leonard: Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.// Sheldon: So I drink.// Amy: No, it’s only if you’ve done it.// Sheldon: Got it.// Amy: I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.// Sheldon: I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.// Penny: Sheldon, what did you do?// Sheldon: Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.// Leonard: Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.// Amy: I’m surprised you would do that.// Sheldon: No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.// Penny: What, he arrested you for that?// Sheldon: No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.// Penny: And then you got arrested.// Sheldon: Oh, and how.// Howard: I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.// Howard: But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.// Howard: What? Are you gonna cry?// Howard: Is it baby hormones or actually sad?// Bernadette: I can’t tell anymore.// Howard: I’ll go get him.// Bernadette: And bring back the bear.// Leonard: This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.// Penny: How?// Leonard: Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.// Penny: Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.// Leonard: Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.// Amy: Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.// Sheldon: Amy.// Amy: You know the rules. Drink.// Penny: Yeah, go ahead.// Leonard: That’s right.// Sheldon: All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.// Penny: I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?// Leonard: I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.// Penny: We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.// Leonard: What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?// Sheldon: I’m calling it. I won.// Raj: I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.// Howard: No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.// Bernadette: I hear that.// Raj: Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?// Howard: Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat.// Raj: Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?// Bernadette: Of course.// Raj: Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?// Howard: Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.// Leonard: Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.// Penny: How long have you had this secret account?// Leonard: A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.// Penny: Well, how much you got in there?// Leonard: Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.// Penny: My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?// Leonard: No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.// Penny: What good is it if you don’t use it?// Leonard: Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.// Penny: Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.// Leonard: Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.// Penny: I hate my job.// Leonard: Really? Why?// Penny: Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.// Leonard: Why didn’t you tell me?// Penny: Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.// Leonard: That’s not true.// Penny: Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?// Leonard: If that’s what you want to do, yes.// Penny: Well, it’s not what I want to do.// Leonard: Oh, yes.// Penny: Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.// Leonard: Well, that is the grown-up thing.// Penny: I guess.// Leonard: I love you.// Penny: I love you, too.// Leonard: You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.// Penny: Well, guess I gotta drink.// Howard: All right, here we go.// Bernadette: I’m not hearing anything.// Howard: Well, give me a second.// Raj: Are you sure you can do this?// Howard: Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?// Raj: I buried it there, so we could go home.// Bernadette: Wait, that’s it.// Raj: Wow.// Bernadette: Isn’t that the best?// Raj: You guys made a person.// Howard: We did.// Raj: And I like to think I helped.// Howard: You didn’t.// Sheldon: Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.// Amy: Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.// Sheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.// Amy: Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.// Sheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.// Amy: Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.// Sheldon: Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.// Amy: Well, we all have a past.Series 09 Episode 21 – The Viewing Party Combustion// Scene: The comic book store.// Sheldon: I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?// Leonard: No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat.// Raj: But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?// Howard: But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man.// Sheldon: Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?// Leonard: But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?// Raj: Well, that’s just Batman.// Leonard: No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man.// Howard: So does that answer your question?// Sheldon: Oh, I haven’t asked it yet.// Raj (checking text on phone): Oh, that’s Claire. Got to run.// (checking text on phone)// Leonard: I thought you were back with Emily.// Raj: Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them.// Leonard: You mean like through their window from behind a bush?// Raj: No, I’m actually dating two women. Later.// Leonard: Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?// Howard: I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.// Leonard: Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: What, why did you get a party sub?// Leonard: People are coming over, it looked fun.// Sheldon: Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.// Leonard: Your attendance implies it’s not.// Sheldon: I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.// Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.// Sheldon: Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow.// Leonard: Oh, you know what? I’m not going.// Sheldon: Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.// Leonard: This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.// Sheldon: You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.// Leonard: You’re the only one who eats them.// Sheldon: And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?// Leonard: I’m not going, you can’t make me.// Sheldon: Well, we’ll just see about that.// Penny: What is the problem?// Sheldon: He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.// Penny: Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?// Leonard: You have fun. I will not be attending.// Sheldon: Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.// Leonard: You’re being ridiculous.// Sheldon: There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.// Leonard: Can you please talk to him?// Penny: Well, why are you fighting him on this?// Leonard: Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.// Penny: Well, I will still come to your meeting.// Sheldon: Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.// Leonard: Why are you taking his side?// Penny: Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.// Sheldon: You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Raj: Man, I’m worn out.// Howard: I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.// Raj: No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting.// Howard: You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.// Raj: But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.// Howard: I guess I am lucky.// Raj: You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?// Bernadette: Hey, Raj.// Raj: Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?// Bernadette: Good. A little tired.// Raj: I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.// Howard: You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?// Bernadette: You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.// Raj: Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.// Sheldon: Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?// Penny: Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.// Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.// Penny: Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting.// Leonard: Leave me alone.// Penny: If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.// Leonard: Not funny.// Penny: You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?// Leonard: Oh, of course, because I’m the only adult around here.// Penny: Really? The only adult?// Leonard: Yeah, that’s right.// Sheldon: Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.// Penny: All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.// Leonard: And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.// Sheldon: All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.// Leonard: I don’t want to.// Sheldon: Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting.// Leonard: Stop saying meeting.// Sheldon: Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.// Amy: I brought my famous spinach dip.// Sheldon: Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.// Scene: Howard’s car.// Howard: I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are.// Raj: Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.// Howard: There you go again.// Raj: I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?// Howard: Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.// Raj: How could you say that?// Howard: Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.// Raj: I never said that.// Howard: Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?// Raj: Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.// Amy: What’s going on with him?// Penny: Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.// Sheldon: Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.// Penny: Don’t worry, he’ll come around.// Amy: Well, I get why he’s annoyed.// Sheldon: Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.// Leonard: You love The Simpsons.// Sheldon: I love Lisa Simpson.// Amy: Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.// Sheldon: Wait. You were pretending?// Amy: Sorry.// Sheldon: No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.// Amy: Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.// Sheldon: Hmm, what do you think?// Penny: You don’t know?// Scene: The stairwell.// Raj: Hey, did I say something to upset you?// Howard: No, I’m fine.// Raj: Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.// Howard: Just drop it.// Raj: Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.// Howard: Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?// Raj: It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with.// Penny: Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.// Sheldon: Gladly.// Leonard: Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character.// Sheldon: It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.// Howard: Wait, what is going on?// Penny: Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.// Amy: Do you guys want to watch with us?// Howard: As long as I don’t have to watch with him.// Raj: Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.// Howard: Why do you get to pick?// Raj: Okay, then you go there.// Howard: Don’t tell me where to go.// Leonard: Howard, just come in here.// Penny: Yeah, come on, Raj.// Raj: Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?// Sheldon: She did.// Howard: And I’m gonna eat it all.// Howard: So what the hell happened?// Leonard: Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.// Howard: Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.// Amy: You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.// Howard: Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period.// Leonard: If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly. (Knock on door) Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize.// (Knock on door)// Stuart: Hey, Leonard.// Leonard: Stuart.// Stuart: Uh, is this not a dress-up party?// Leonard: No.// Stuart: Was it ever a dress-up party?// Stuart: Howard, didn’t you tell me it was a dress-up party?// Howard: Yeah.// Scene: Penny’s apartment. Knock on door.// Stuart: I was told this is where to go if I’m mad at Howard.// Penny: May I take your cloak?// Stuart: Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.// Sheldon: Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.// Stuart: So what happened with you and Howard?// Raj: Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.// Stuart: I’m jealous. Closest I’ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.// Leonard: I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.// Howard: Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.// Leonard: Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.// Amy: Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less.// Leonard: Sorry?// Amy: Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.// Leonard: Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close.// Amy: Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?// Leonard: Penny, but…// Amy: Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?// Leonard: I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.// Amy: Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?// Leonard: Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?// Howard: I don’t know. I like the pain of others.// Leonard: Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.// Howard: No, she doesn’t.// Leonard: She defends him all the time.// Howard: She does not.// Amy: Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?// Howard: Well, she did. And human resources.// Leonard: Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?// Howard: Son of a bitch.// Leonard: You’re, you’re right, it feels good.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Raj: All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?// Stuart: Two women, huh?// Sheldon (at knock on door): Oh, perhaps it’s Amy coming to her senses.// (at knock on door)// Penny: What’s up?// Leonard: You know, you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.// Penny: Where’d you get that from?// Leonard: From Amy.// Penny: Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?// Amy: Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.// Penny: I don’t always defend Sheldon.// Leonard: Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.// Penny: What about your weird relationship with him?// Leonard: That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.// Howard: Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?// Leonard: I don’t think so. Why?// Howard: Well just a feeling.// Scene: A hospital waiting room.// Leonard: It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.// Sheldon: Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.// Bernadette: He’s gonna be okay.// Sheldon: Now it’s a fun fact.// Stuart: Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.// Bernadette: Why are you dressed like that?// Stuart: Oh, uh, Howard thought it’d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.// Bernadette: That wasn’t nice.// Stuart: No, but he almost died, so we’re cool.// Raj: You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.// Amy: How?// Raj: Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.// Penny: Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.// Raj: Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.// Sheldon: Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.// Raj: Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch, and they don’t have sex.// Penny: There you go.// Leonard: That’s true.// Sheldon: Fair enough.// Howard: Hey.// Leonard: Hey.// Bernadette: You all right?// Howard: I’m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.// Leonard: Let’s get out of here.// Amy: That was scary.// Sheldon: Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.// Scene: The street.// Raj (shouting from upstairs window): Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?// (shouting from upstairs window)// Stuart: How come your head has your face on it?// Sheldon: They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.// Stuart: Don’t you guys have anything better to do?// Leonard: Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.// Stuart: That’s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid… aaargh!// Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: I never got to ask my question about Batman.// Leonard: What is it?// Sheldon: If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?// Penny: Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?// Sheldon: I’ll be back.Series 09 Episode 22 – The Fermentation Bifurcation// Scene: The apartment// Penny: Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.// Leonard: That sounds fun.// Penny: Mm-hmm.// Leonard: How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?// Howard: ‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.// Sheldon: Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.// Amy: But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.// Sheldon: I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember.// Penny: All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.// Raj: I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.// Leonard: I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.// Amy: Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.// Sheldon: Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.// Amy: Well, I’m going. You couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now.// Sheldon: I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.// Amy: And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.// Penny: The little choo-choo for toddlers?// Amy: And now you know why I needed the massage.// Howard: Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.// Bernadette: It’s okay, you should go.// Howard: You sure?// Bernadette: Of course.// Penny: Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.// Sheldon: Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me.// Bernadette: Me? How? Why?// Sheldon: Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.// Bernadette: Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know.// Sheldon: Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to.// Leonard: The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.// Bernadette: I guess we could give it a try.// Sheldon: Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.// Howard: I bet you’d like a drink right now.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard’s workshop// Raj: Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?// Leonard: Sure. I’d like to meet her.// Raj: Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.// Sheldon: Oh, but I won’t be there.// Raj: Funny how that worked out.// Leonard: Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?// Raj: No, I’m still dating her.// Leonard: Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?// Raj: They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions.// Sheldon: You know, it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.// Leonard: Who’s Frank and Alicia?// Sheldon: You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?// Howard: Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready.// Sheldon: I am going to record this for posterity.// Leonard: All right, here goes nothing.// Sheldon: Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?// Leonard: Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.// Sheldon: Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.// Raj: It’s, it’s beautiful.// Howard: Actually, it’s making me dizzy.// Leonard: Good, it’s not just me.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Claire (on phone): Hello.// (on phone)// Raj: Hey, Claire.// Claire: Hey, what’s up?// Raj: Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.// Claire: Sure, I guess. If you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step.// Raj: Why would it be too big a step?// Claire: I don’t know. I just don’t want things to get weird.// Raj: Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.// Claire: Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don’t like me? What if they like me and I don’t like them?// Raj: Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Hey, you ready to go?// Leonard: Hang on.// Penny: What are you doing?// Leonard: Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.// Penny: You actually smell the wine?// Leonard: I mostly just smell my nasal spray.// Penny: Are your sinuses acting up?// Leonard: Since my preschool got a bunny.// Penny: Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?// Sheldon: Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.// Penny: Oh, good for you.// Sheldon: Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.// Penny: No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.// Sheldon: Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.// Leonard: Okay, have fun.// Sheldon: Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.// Leonard: We’re leaving now!// Sheldon: Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.// Penny: Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.// Sheldon: Boy, do I love restrictions.// Scene: The wine tasting.// Howard: Hey. Where is everybody?// Amy: Oh, we’re the first ones here.// Howard: Oh. Cool.// Amy: Yeah. Cool.// Howard: You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.// Amy: Oh, I do. It was three years ago.// Howard: Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.// Amy: So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.// Howard: I know. What are they gonna talk about?// Amy: I don’t know. I really don’t know.// Leonard: Hey.// Howard: Oh, good.// Amy: Oh, thank God.// Penny: You guys been here long?// Howard: No, two minutes.// Amy: But yes.// Howard: Where’s Claire?// Raj: Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.// Leonard: Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?// Raj: Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma.// Amy: Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?// Penny: Oh, yeah.// Amy: Are you gonna say hi to him?// Penny: Uh, I don’t know.// Raj: Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.// Bernadette: I brought sparkling cider.// Sheldon: Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.// Bernadette: So what do you want to do tonight?// Sheldon: Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.// Bernadette: There’s more than one?// Sheldon: You’ve heard of French toast?// Bernadette: Yeah.// Sheldon: Cinnamon toast?// Sheldon: Melba toast?// Sheldon: You get where I’m going here?// Amy: I’m getting an earthy note.// Penny: Ah, there’s definitely some oak.// Raj: Also, uh, cherries?// Leonard: I smell nothing.// Howard: Really? Nothing?// Leonard: Just a whole lot of Afrin.// Zack: Penny?// Penny: Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.// Howard: Yeah, hey, buddy.// Amy: Hello.// Raj: Hey.// Zack: Hey, did you two get married?// Penny: We did.// Leonard: Yeah, mm-hmm.// Zack: To each other?// Penny: Yes.// Zack: Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.// Leonard: Thanks.// Zack: So how’s the science world? What are you guys up to?// Howard: We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.// Leonard: But we won’t bore you with the details.// Zack: Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.// Amy: Mike deGrasse Tyson?// Howard: Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.// Zack: So what’s your invention?// Howard: Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.// Leonard: What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.// Zack: Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.// Howard: You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever.// Zack: Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?// Howard: Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons.// Leonard: And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.// Zack: Is it better than the one they use now?// Howard: A lot.// Leonard: Way better.// Zack: Huh. You sure you guys are smart?// Sheldon: H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220.// Bernadette: I’m sorry, I have to ask.// Sheldon: When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.// Bernadette: What is it about trains that you like so much?// Sheldon: What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.// Bernadette: That’s lovely, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.// Leonard: I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.// Howard: Me, too.// Leonard: Why didn’t you say something?// Howard: Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.// Raj: You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.// Amy: It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.// Penny: E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.// Amy: How do you know that?// Penny: Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.// Claire: Hey, Raj.// Raj: Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it.// Leonard: Would you like a glass of wine?// Raj: I said no questions.// Sheldon: And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons.// Bernadette: Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.// Sheldon: You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.// Bernadette: Okay, but just for a little bit.// Sheldon: Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.// Bernadette: All right.// Sheldon: Ready?// Bernadette: You bet.// Sheldon: Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall.// Bernadette: Oh. I like the idea of being tall.// Sheldon: I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.// Bernadette: This is getting fun. What’s next?// Sheldon: You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.// Bernadette: Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months.// Sheldon: What do you do?// Bernadette: I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.// Sheldon: He wants to see I.D.// Amy: So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you.// Claire: Really? Like what?// Amy: Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them.// Zack: Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.// Raj: Zack, this is my friend Claire.// Zack: You’re hot. You seeing anybody?// Raj: Uh, she’s seeing me.// Zack: Why’d you say she’s your friend?// Raj: We’re just keeping it casual.// Zack: Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.// Claire: I don’t know. Ask him.// Zack: Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.// Scene: The toilets.// Leonard: Maybe we should take a step back.// Howard: Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.// Leonard: No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.// Howard: But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.// Leonard: What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?// Howard: Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.// Leonard: How?// Howard: Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.// Leonard: Very funny.// Howard: You got something better?// Leonard: Well, not really.// Howard: Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?// Leonard: Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.// Sheldon: The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?// Bernadette: Does it have eyes?// Sheldon: Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.// Bernadette: I stab it in the middle eye.// Sheldon: Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.// Bernadette: Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.// Sheldon: Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.// Bernadette: Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.// Sheldon: Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.// Bernadette: Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I’m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.// Sheldon: I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius.// Bernadette: Well, thanks again.// Sheldon: You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.// Bernadette: I might just take you up on that.// Sheldon: Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.// Raj: Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire.// Zack: What are you talking about?// Raj: I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me.// Zack: Oh, man, I didn’t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.// Raj: Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.// Zack: Anything for you, my little foreign friend.// Claire: So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?// Penny: Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.// Leonard: I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.// Howard: Yeah. He still has an AOL address.// Zack: I see what you’re saying. She’s not so great.// Raj: Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.// Zack: Polo.// Raj: So, uh, what are you guys talking about?// Claire: Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating.// Raj: Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.// Penny: We didn’t.// Amy: You just did.// Zack: Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.// Leonard: Morning.// Sheldon: Morning.// Leonard: Ugh. Too much wine.// Sheldon: Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.// Leonard: Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?// Sheldon: Of course.// Leonard: Does it bother you?// Sheldon: No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.// Leonard: Who are these people?// Sheldon: Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink.Series 09 Episode 23 – The Line Substitution Solution// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Helium.// Sheldon: Yes.// Penny: Yes.// Sheldon: Taylor Swift.// Penny: Yes. Pi.// Sheldon: Yes. Kardashian.// Penny: More specific.// Sheldon: Khloe?// Sheldon: See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe.// Penny: Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?// Leonard: What are you guys doing?// Sheldon: Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.// Leonard: Oh, let me try.// Penny: Okay.// Leonard: Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.// Sheldon: I’m sorry, who is Mike Drop?// Leonard: Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?// Penny: Sure.// Leonard: Thanks.// Penny: No problem.// Leonard: Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?// Sheldon: Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?// Leonard: Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.// Sheldon: She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.// Penny: You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?// Leonard: Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.// Penny: Or a way for you to avoid her?// Leonard: I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.// Penny: Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.// Leonard: Seriously?// Penny: Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d like for us to have a good relationship.// Leonard: That is very mature of you, so I’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah.// Sheldon: All right, back to learning.// Sheldon: Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.// Penny: Or as I know him?// Sheldon: Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.// Penny: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The comic book store.// Raj: Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.// Sheldon: Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.// Leonard: When’s the screening?// Raj: Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.// Howard: Let’s do it.// Leonard: Penny’s busy with my mother, so I’m in.// Sheldon: Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.// Leonard: You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?// Howard: In fact, that’s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?// Raj: Uh, I’d say by three.// Sheldon: You’re really going without me?// Leonard: It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you.// Sheldon: You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting.// Leonard: People do it all the time.// Sheldon: You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.// Howard: If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.// Stuart: People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.// Howard: Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.// Stuart: And now I feel worse again.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Beverly: I’m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He’s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?// Penny: Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?// Beverly: Dear, I’m a psychiatrist. You don’t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.// Penny: Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs.// Beverly: Very well. What’s the last book you read?// Penny: Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?// Beverly: Penny, it’s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?// Penny: Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?// Beverly: And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?// Penny: Uncomfortable.// Beverly: That was a joke, dear.// Penny: Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?// Beverly: So just the two of us?// Penny: Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Stuart: Hey.// Amy: What are you doing here? You’re not Sheldon.// Stuart: I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.// Amy: Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?// Stuart: No, it’s not like that. There’s a long line he’d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.// Amy: We’re not going shopping together.// Stuart: You sure? I’m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.// Amy: Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?// Stuart: Look, lady, I just work here.// Scene: The cinema line.// Howard: We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?// Sheldon: Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?// Raj: Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.// Leonard: Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.// Sheldon: Stuart, what are you doing here?// Stuart: Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?// Sheldon: I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?// Stuart: Oh, I’m not upset with you, but Amy’s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.// Sheldon: Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.// Stuart: You’re darn right it’s fair play, you selfish jerk.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Amy: You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?// Beverly: Maybe he couldn’t get a word in edgewise.// Amy: I’m sorry, I’ve been going on and on.// Beverly: Oh, it’s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.// Amy: I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.// Beverly: Well, I do admire your resolve. You’re an extraordinary woman.// Amy: Thank you.// Penny: You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?// Bernadette: Amy’s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You’re with her son, who she doesn’t.// Amy: Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?// Beverly: Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.// Amy: Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.// Penny: You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.// Beverly: Yes. Well, what can you do?// Amy (knock on door): Maybe it’s Sheldon, here to say he’s sorry.// (knock on door)// Stuart: Sheldon says he’s sorry.// Amy: Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door.// Stuart: I would have done it for three.// Raj: Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.// Howard: Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.// Raj: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.// Sheldon: Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?// Stuart: Uh, no, she’s still pretty mad.// Sheldon: Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?// Stuart: I said, Sheldon says he’s sorry.// Sheldon: Oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick.// Leonard: You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?// Sheldon: I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I’ll lose my spot.// Stuart: I’m happy to hold your place till you get back.// Sheldon: You would do that?// Stuart: Consider it my way of getting more of your money.// Sheldon: You’re a good man.// Bernadette: So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?// Beverly: Oh, I didn’t realize you two work together.// Bernadette: Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team.// Beverly: Oh, what are you currently developing?// Bernadette: Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.// Beverly: That’s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.// Amy: Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.// Beverly: It was.// Bernadette: Well, let’s get back to Penny. Hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?// Penny: Um, it has seat warmers.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Amy: Come in.// Sheldon: Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.// Amy: Fine.// Sheldon: Oh, thanks, you’re a peach. Beverly, we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.// Penny: How long have I had spinach in my teeth?// Beverly: Since the airport, dear.// Howard: You look like you come with a kickstand.// Raj: You can’t make me feel bad.// Howard: Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?// Leonard: So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?// Sheldon: I’m back.// Leonard: Hey, how’d it go?// Sheldon: It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.// Stuart: Anyone else need anything before I go?// Howard: I’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.// Stuart: That’s mean.// Howard: Five.// Stuart: You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.// Howard: Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.// Man: Hey, guys.// Woman: You made it.// Sheldon: Did you see that? He just cut the line.// Leonard: He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.// Sheldon: No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.// Howard: We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way.// Sheldon: What if every person in front of us let someone cut?// Leonard: We’d still get in.// Sheldon: What if each of those people let someone cut?// Leonard: Still get in.// Sheldon: But then each of those people let someone cut?// Leonard: We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair.// Sheldon: Excuse me.// Leonard: Oh, please don’t.// Sheldon: Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line.// Man: Oh, uh, I’m with my friends. It’s cool.// Sheldon: Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: You need to go to the back of the line.// Man: Uh, who made you line monitor?// Sheldon: Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.// Man: Is this guy for real?// Leonard: Boy, I wish I could say no.// Beverly: That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.// Amy: Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.// Beverly: Your relationship with him is fascinating. I’m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.// Amy: Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut.// Beverly: Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?// Bernadette: Do I think he’d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.// Beverly: Wonderful. I’ll give you my contact information.// Bernadette: Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.// Beverly: About what?// Penny: Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I’m getting nowhere.// Beverly: Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?// Penny: What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to my face.// Beverly: My intention was never to insult you.// Penny: You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?// Beverly: Well, it’s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.// Penny: Okay, good example.// Sheldon: What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?// Man: The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.// Sheldon: They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?// Man: As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.// Raj: He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.// Sheldon: Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?// Man: Told you.// Sheldon: Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you.// Howard: I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair.// Sheldon: You know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.// Leonard: Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here.// Sheldon: Now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…// Woman: Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.// Sheldon: I most certainly did not.// Woman: I saw you.// Man: If you’re feeling dizzy, it’s because the tables have turned.// Sheldon: Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in.// Leonard: Buddy, let it go.// Sheldon: No, I can’t. This isn’t right.// Leonard: You did everything you could.// Sheldon: No, I could’ve done more.// Leonard: Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask.// Penny: To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.// Beverly: I’m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore.// Amy: I know how you feel. She didn’t invite any of us.// Penny: It was spur of the moment.// Bernadette: But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.// Beverly: I could’ve watched it on the Internet?// Penny: Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?// Beverly: No, I would’ve said you’re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would’ve been nice.// Penny: You really think we made a mistake?// Beverly: At the time I did. But I’ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.// Penny: Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested.// Beverly: I would find that perfectly acceptable.// Penny: She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Bernadette: Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while.// Howard (through bathroom door): I’m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that’s a good question, Jim. Don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.// (through bathroom door)Series 09 Episode 24 – The Convergence Convergence// Scene: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: Hi, how was the screening?// Leonard: Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.// Penny: Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.// Leonard: How’d it go with my mother?// Penny: Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.// Leonard: Wow. Well done.// Penny: Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.// Leonard: Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her.// Penny: No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.// Leonard: Wait, we’re gonna get married again?// Penny: Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.// Leonard: Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.// Penny: Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one.// Leonard: Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her.// Penny: Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?// Leonard: I just said why, we don’t like her.// Penny: Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.// Leonard: Is your brother out of prison?// Penny: Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.// Leonard: I’d love it if my dad could come.// Penny: Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce.// Leonard: Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.// Penny: Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.// Amy: So there’s no maid of honour?// Penny: No.// Amy: Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?// Penny: I don’t see how I could.// Amy: Then I graciously accept.// Bernadette: Who’s going to officiate?// Penny: I was kind of hoping you would.// Amy: Wait, now I’m just some lousy maid of honour?// Sheldon: Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.// Penny: Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?// Sheldon: Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.// Bernadette: Who’s Erno Rubik?// Sheldon: Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.// Penny: Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?// Sheldon: Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.// Bernadette: Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother.// Penny: Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Beverly: How dare you invite your father without consulting me.// Leonard: Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.// Beverly: You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.// Leonard: I know, and there’s no excuse for that.// Beverly: He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn’t shown him any physical affection for years.// Leonard: I was wrong, there’s three excuses for that.// Scene: Howard’s workshop.// Howard: Oh, my God. It’s working.// Raj: You sure?// Howard: Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.// Raj: You’re right. You realize what this means?// Howard: Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system.// Raj: Congratulations.// Howard: Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.// Raj: Open it.// Howard: Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That’s weird.// Raj: Is there a window around here we don’t know about?// Howard: I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.// Raj: Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Mary Cooper: Thank you for picking me up.// Sheldon: Oh, you’re welcome.// Mary: I was speaking to your young lady.// Amy: My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.// Mary: Oh, please call me Mary.// Amy: Okay, Mary.// Sheldon: You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper.// Mary: Sheldon, don’t be silly.// Sheldon: Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better.// Mary: It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.// Sheldon: Well, actually, I…// Amy: It sure was.// Mary: I’ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.// Sheldon: Excuse me, I take care of him.// Mary: Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?// Amy: Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny’s family is coming tomorrow.// Sheldon: Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here.// Mary: Oh, Beverly. How nice.// Amy: You’ve met her, right?// Mary: Yes, I have.// Sheldon: Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire.// Mary: Either way, let’s stop and get some garlic.// Beverly: So, Mary, how have you been?// Mary: Well, thank you so much for asking. I’ve been well, and you?// Beverly: Very good.// Mary: Good.// Sheldon: I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great.// Mary: Sheldon tells me your husband’s coming.// Beverly: My ex-husband.// Mary: Oh, I’m so sorry.// Beverly: Don’t be.// Mary: All right.// Penny: Whew, chilly.// Amy: I think I can see my breath.// Beverly: We can hear you.// Penny: Sorry.// Amy: Sorry.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: I can’t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.// Bernadette: Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting.// Howard: Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.// Raj: Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.// Howard: Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.// Bernadette: You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?// Howard: I’m sorry, you find this funny?// Raj: No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.// Scene: The foyer.// Leonard: Oh, we have to use the stairs.// Alfred Hofstadter: When are they gonna fix your elevator?// Leonard: Uh, I don’t, any day now.// Alfred: Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I’ll have a heart attack and not have to see her.// Leonard: Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I’m really glad you’re here.// Alfred: Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.// Leonard: Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.// Alfred: Ah, she’s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.// Leonard: Thanks, Dad.// Alfred: How the hell did you do that?// Sheldon: Isn’t this nice?// Leonard: Hey, we’re here.// Penny: Alfred. Thank you for coming!// Alfred: Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.// Penny: Thank you.// Leonard: Dad, you remember Sheldon.// Sheldon: Dr. Hofstadter.// Alfred: Dr. Cooper.// Leonard: This is Sheldon’s mother, Mary.// Alfred: How do you do?// Mary: Nice to meet you.// Leonard: And his girlfriend, Amy.// Alfred: A pleasure.// Amy: Hi.// Leonard: And, of course, Mom.// Alfred: Hello, my hateful shrew.// Beverly: Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.// Sheldon: All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension.// Leonard: All right, you two, don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?// Alfred: Of course. I’m sorry.// Beverly: Oh, look at that, you can apologize.// Leonard: Mom.// Beverly: I’m sorry.// Mary: You know, the Bible says forgiveness…// Sheldon: Mom.// Mary: I’m sorry.// Penny: Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.// Sheldon: It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: I’m not sorry. That’s true.// Howard: I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?// Raj: You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.// Bernadette: Guys, come on. We’re meeting everyone for dinner.// Howard: One sec. I’m just afraid if I respond, then they’ll know I got it.// Raj: Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.// Bernadette: Are you done with this nonsense?// Howard: It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.// Raj: Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.// Howard: You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us.// Raj: I also love the enemies of America.// Beverly: Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard’s father doesn’t discourage you from the commitment you’ve made to one another.// Penny: No, of course not.// Beverly: Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.// Leonard: Mom, please save something for the toast.// Mary: So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?// Alfred: Oh, I’m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.// Mary: My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.// Sheldon: Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking.// Amy: Play with your phone.// Alfred: Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.// Mary: I don’t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that’s very interesting.// Alfred: Oh. I, I didn’t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.// Mary: Really?// Alfred: Yes. Yes, I’m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.// Mary: Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.// Scene: Howard’s car.// Raj: Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.// Howard: Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.// Raj: What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.// Howard: I’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.// Bernadette: Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you.// Raj: I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.// Penny: You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?// Beverly: Yeah.// Leonard: Is that Howard in front of us?// Penny: Oh, maybe. Get closer.// Howard’s car.// Howard: Oh, God. I think someone’s following us.// Bernadette: You’re being ridiculous.// Howard: I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail.// Raj: Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.// Leonard’s car.// Penny: Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way.// Leonard: I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.// Penny: Oh, so follow him.// Raj: Oh, no.// Howard: I told you.// Bernadette: It’s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.// Penny: Well, go faster. You’re losing him.// Leonard: What is his hurry?// Penny: You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s you.// Howard: He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?// Raj: I, I think he wants us to pull over.// Bernadette: Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone.// Howard: Hang on.// Scene: The restaurant.// Alfred: So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?// Mary: No, just focused on work and the church.// Alfred: Ah. And what do you do?// Mary: I work at the church.// Alfred: Well, they’re lucky to have you.// Mary: Well, thank you.// Alfred: You’re welcome.// Amy: Do you realize what’s happening here?// Sheldon: Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.// Penny: Hey.// Amy: What took you guys so long?// Leonard: Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.// Penny: So, what did we miss?// Alfred: Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.// Mary: Leonard, your father is just charming.// Beverly: He’s also broke. Did he mention that?// Leonard: Okay, Mom, you sit over there.// Penny: Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them.// Sheldon: If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread.// Bernadette (on phone): Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don’t you go ahead and eat. We’re gonna be a while.// (on phone)// Howard: I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me.// Alfred: Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.// Mary: Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon’s father.// Sheldon: That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.// Amy: I’d be lost without you.// Leonard: Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.// Sheldon: See, that’s funny because…// Amy: Back to your phone.// Leonard: Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.// Penny: Oh, thanks for asking until I did.// Amy: Hear, hear.// Leonard: Cheers.// Alfred: I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.// Penny: Aw.// Alfred: Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.// Beverly: What the hell is that supposed to mean?// Alfred: Why don’t you take a pill?// Beverly: Like you did before sex?// Alfred: What I really needed was a blindfold.// Mary: All right, everyone, calm down. Let’s all remember what it says in the Bible: He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty.// Beverly: Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?// Mary: When God writes one, I will.// Penny: Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.// Alfred: Leonard, if you don’t mind, I, I think I’m a little tired. I’m gonna call it a night.// Leonard: Sure, Dad.// Mary: I’m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.// Alfred: Would you like to share a cab?// Mary: That would be fine.// Alfred: Where are you staying?// Mary: I’m at the Westin.// Alfred: Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?// Mary: I think that you could.// Leonard: What is happening there?// Sheldon: I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.// Sheldon: She’s still not answering.// Leonard: My father’s not texting me back.// Penny: ‘Cause they both turned their phones off.// Sheldon: I don’t like this at all.// Leonard: I don’t like it either.// Penny: Really? ‘Cause I love it."
10,"Series 10 Episode 01 – The Conjugal Conjecture// Following a “previously on” sequence.// Sceme: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.// Sheldon: Leonard? Leonard?// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: You realize you and I could become brothers.// Leonard: We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.// Sheldon: I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.// Leonard: Go to sleep.// Sheldon: Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?// Penny: Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.// Sheldon: Very well.// Leonard: I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.// Penny: God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.// Sheldon: Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.// Leonard: Yeah, drive safe.// Penny: Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.// Sheldon: It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.// Penny: What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.// Beverley: Penny, wait.// Penny: Why?// Beverley: I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.// Leonard: Well, why? What’s wrong?// Sheldon: Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?// Beverley: I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.// Sheldon: Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?// Beverley: Stop it, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?// Beverley: I don’t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.// Sheldon: Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.// Penny: Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.// Sheldon: And turned their phones off.// Leonard: Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.// Penny: Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.// Beverley: Well, we can’t have that.// Sheldon: You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Raj: It is funny when you think about it.// Howard: Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.// Bernadette: Because you were driving like a lunatic.// Howard: Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.// Raj (doorbell rings): Oh, I’ll get it.// (doorbell rings)// Bernadette: It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.// Howard: I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.// Raj: Hello.// Air Force Officer: I’m looking for Howard Wolowitz.// Raj: Howard Wolowitz?// Air Force Officer: I have the right address, don’t I?// Raj: Address?// Air Force Officer: Is he here?// Raj: Um, no.// Air Force Officer: Do you know where I can find him?// Raj: May I ask what this is about?// Air Force Officer: No, you may not.// Raj: Very well.// Air Force Officer: Have him call me.// Raj: Okay.// Howard (off): Raj, who’s at the door?// (off)// Raj: That’s not him.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Penny: Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.// Susan (Penny’s mother): Like what? Do they know about your brother?// Penny: Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.// Susan: Why would you do that?// Penny: What?// Susan: The world doesn’t need to know our problems.// Penny: Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…// Wyatt (Penny’s father): Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.// Susan: You really think it’s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?// Wyatt: Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.// Susan: Well, quit it.// Penny: So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.// Randall (Penny’s brother): Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn’t have left the state.// Susan: All right, that’s enough jail talk.// Randall: Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.// Susan: You sent your brother cigarettes?// Wyatt: He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.// Susan: Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it.// Wyatt: Anyway, we’re here, slugger.// Howard: That’s great, now they know where I live.// Raj: What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.// Bernadette: Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.// Raj: Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?// Howard: Yeah. I would not have done that for you.// Bernadette: Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.// Howard: All right, all right.// Raj: Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.// Howard: Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.// Raj: Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.// Howard: Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?// Raj: That’s what he said to me.// Leonard: Here you are, Mother.// Beverley: Thank you.// Leonard: I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.// Beverley: I can’t wait for this day to be over.// Leonard: Yeah, special, like that. (Knock on door) That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.// (Knock on door)// Sheldon: All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.// Leonard: Hey, guys, come on in.// Alfred: Oh, thank you.// Mary: Good morning.// Beverley: Morning.// Sheldon: Hello.// Alfred: How is everyone today?// Beverley: Good, and you?// Alfred: Good, good.// Beverley: Good.// Mary: I’m good, too.// Sheldon: So, did you defile my mother or not?// Mary: Sheldon. You’re being rude.// Alfred: If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.// Sheldon: Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?// Mary: That’s enough.// Alfred: Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.// Leonard: You don’t know his girlfriend very well.// Sheldon: Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.// Randall: You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard.// Wyatt: Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.// Susan: Not funny, Wyatt.// Penny: I thought it was really funny.// Wyatt: Thanks.// Susan: Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment.// Randall: That’s not much of a joke.// Penny: Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.// Susan: Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash.// Randall: Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?// Mary: How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?// Sheldon: A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.// Leonard: Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.// Alfred: Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.// Mary: Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas.// Alfred: Maybe we meet halfway.// Sheldon: What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.// Beverley: You’re not seriously going to visit each other.// Alfred: And why wouldn’t we?// Beverley: Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me.// Alfred: Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus.// Leonard: Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.// Mary: No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.// Sheldon: What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.// Leonard: Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?// Sheldon: Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?// Leonard: This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.// Sheldon: But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?// Leonard: Fine, then you go.// Mary: Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go.// Alfred: I’ll go with you.// Leonard: That still leaves me here with him.// Sheldon: Hang on, hang on. We’re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh, here. I’ve got it.// Amy: Who’s ready for a wedding?// Sheldon: Great, now I have to start all over.// Wyatt: So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?// Penny: Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.// Susan: See what happens when you work hard?// Randall: Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em.// Susan: Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.// Wyatt: I’ll drink to that.// Susan: Haven’t you had enough?// Wyatt: Penny drinks more than I do.// Penny: Well, I learned from the best.// Wyatt: Aw.// Penny: Aw.// Susan: Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.// Randall: You see what I’ve gotta put up with.// Susan: What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?// Randall: It’s called getting caught, Mother.// Leonard: Hello.// Wyatt: Hey, there he is.// Penny: Hey.// Susan: Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again.// Leonard: Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.// Beverley: Hello.// Susan: Hi.// Randall: We are not white trash.// Amy: Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?// Alfred: Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused.// Mary: Oh, so am I.// Sheldon: You made God sad today, Mom.// Amy: Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.// Sheldon: Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.// Amy: It was a lot hotter than it sounds.// Alfred: You’re a patient young lady.// Sheldon: Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.// Howard: Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.// Raj: Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.// Howard: That’s really stupid advice.// Raj: You know that hurts my feelings.// Howard: Calm down, try not to think about it.// Howard: Why do I bother talking to you?// Raj: Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?// Howard: I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?// Raj: Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.// Howard: What’s the point of that story?// Raj: I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. (Howard laughs) There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.// (Howard laughs)// Beverley: So, what do you do for a living?// Randall: Mommy, you want to take this one?// Susan: Um, Randall’s in between jobs.// Randall: And court appearances.// Wyatt: It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father.// Beverley: Prepare to be disappointed.// Leonard: And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?// Wyatt: Well, I could use another beer.// Susan: You’re done. He’s done.// Penny: Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?// Randall: Not at all.// Scene: The wedding ceremony.// Stuart: Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I’m, uh, Leonard’s friend, Stuart.// Beverley: Nice to see you, too.// Stuart: Hi, I’m Stuart.// Alfred: Oh, I’m Alfred. Leonard’s father.// Stuart: Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I’m sorry, did you two want to sit together?// Together: No.// Stuart: I was wondering why the front row was available.// Bernadette: Okay, I think we’re ready.// Sheldon: Why do people cry at weddings?// Mary: They’re practicing for what’s coming later.// Susan: Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding.// Randall: Thank you for my new teeth.// Wyatt: Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money.// Bernadette: We’re here today to celebrate love.// Beverley: Urgh.// Alfred: Sigh louder, no one heard you.// Stuart: Really, I can move.// Bernadette: Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.// Sheldon: Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.// Bernadette: Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off.// Howard: At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.// Bernadette: Howard.// Penny: Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.// Leonard: Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t// need to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.// Penny: Oh.// Bernadette: Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.// Alfred: I’d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don’t bring out the best in each other.// But something wonderful did come from our relationship. That young man right there.// Beverley: I couldn’t agree more.// Stuart: That’s beautiful.// Bernadette: Thank you. All right, let’s continue.// Sheldon: Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer.// Amy: It’s happening.// Sheldon: Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.// Leonard: Thank you.// Bernadette: Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Beverley: Thank you for taking us to the airport.// Leonard: Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.// Alfred: Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I’m sorry if I upset you.// Beverley: Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don’t you get into the carpool lane?// Alfred: Well, that’s a solid line. He can’t cross that.// Leonard: That’s okay. I can make it over.// Beverley: No, no, let’s plod along. It’ll make your father feel more comfortable.// Alfred: What makes me comfortable is knowing I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.// Beverley: Do the world a favour, and don’t wake up tomorrow morning.// Leonard: That was almost a minute.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Mary: There’s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?// Amy: You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.// Mary: Good. Thank you.// Sheldon: Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.// Mary: Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.// Sheldon: Yes ma’am.// Amy: Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.// Sheldon: Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.// Amy: I will not have you be disrespectful to me.// Sheldon: What, you’re not my mother.// Mary: Don’t you be disrespectful to her.// Mary: You’ll get there. You’ve just gotta put some zing on it.// Susan: Penny, I don’t know what I was worried about. You’re friends are just lovely.// Penny: Oh, thanks, Mom.// Susan: Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.// Penny: Is he? I never noticed.// Wyatt: He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.// Randall: Cops, cops, be cool.Series 10 Episode 02 – The Military Miniturization// Following a “previously on” sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.// Leonard: So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?// Sheldon: Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game.// Howard (entering): All right, we got a problem.// (entering)// Leonard: What’s up?// Howard: The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.// Leonard: Really?// Raj: Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.// Sheldon: Oh, what did he say?// Raj: He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.// Sheldon: That doesn’t sound terrifying.// Raj: To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.// Leonard: You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.// Howard: And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially.// Leonard: There goes our big payday.// Howard: I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don’t have to try so hard in bed.// Leonard: You do that, too?// Howard: Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?// Sheldon: Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?// Raj: Well, you’re kidding, right?// Sheldon: Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?// Howard: Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.// Sheldon: Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?// Credits sequence.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Bernadette: I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck.// Penny: All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.// Bernadette: He won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.// Penny: You know, when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.// Amy: Does that help?// Penny: Well, for a while. Then he comes back.// Bernadette: I don’t believe this.// Amy: What’s wrong?// Bernadette: This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.// Amy: You did already know, right?// Bernadette: No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?// Penny: No. You told me not to.// Bernadette: I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great.// Amy: Why don’t you want anyone to know?// Bernadette: ‘Cause I’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I’m pregnant they might give it to someone else.// Penny: Would they really do that?// Bernadette: I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.// Raj: Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.// Leonard: Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.// Raj: Fine, I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman.// Howard: You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.// Leonard: That’s not a bad idea.// Raj: Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer.// Howard: Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?// Raj: My cousin does work in a call centre.// Howard: And my cousin’s a lawyer.// Sheldon: We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me.// Leonard: You’re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all.// Sheldon: I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.// Leonard: That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.// Sheldon: Or in German, a Besserwisser.// Penny: How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?// Bernadette: I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.// Amy: Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?// Bernadette: From all the Dove Bars I ate. I’m pregnant. Try to keep up. I’m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.// Amy: Well, whatever happens, we’re here for you.// Bernadette: Thanks. You guys are the best.// Penny: Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!// Amy: What?// Penny: I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…// Bernadette: I forgot my coat.// Penny: Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.// Amy: Oh, but you did it so well. That’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.// Penny: Is that really what’s important right now?// Amy: I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up.// Penny: That’s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that.// Amy: I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.// Scene: Howard’s workshop.// Howard: Give me a second to call my cousin.// Sheldon: I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.// Howard: First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy.// Howard’s cousin (on skype): Hello.// (on skype)// Howard: Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.// Marty: Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.// Howard: Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we’re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.// Leonard: Hi.// Sheldon: Hello.// Howard: And this is my friend, Raj.// Raj: Oh, I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office.// Leonard: I saw it. It’s big.// Howard: Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?// Marty: Well, I don’t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don’t sign anything.// Sheldon: Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?// Marty: That’s not what I meant.// Sheldon: That’s what you said.// Sheldon: This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say.// Marty: Howard, why is he yelling at me?// Sheldon: All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?// Howard: Marty, let me call you back.// Leonard: Someday, when I’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me.// Sheldon: You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.// Scene: Bernadette’s office.// Penny: Hi.// Bernadette: Hey. What brings you by?// Penny: Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.// Bernadette: Oh. How was it?// Penny: Great.// Bernadette: Fell asleep?// Penny: In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?// Bernadette: I’m furious.// Penny: Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?// Bernadette: No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about.// Penny: Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.// Bernadette: It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?// Penny: Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.// Bernadette: What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.// Penny: Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows.// Bernadette: Why did you do that?// Penny: Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.// Bernadette: Get out.// Penny: Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.// Sheldon: I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.// Leonard: ‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people.// Sheldon: Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?// Leonard: I’m getting enraged.// Sheldon: Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?// Howard: No.// Leonard: Don’t speak.// Sheldon’s phone: Aw, nuts.// Colonel Williams: Gentlemen, I’m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.// Howard: Hello.// Colonel Williams: So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?// Howard: It’s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.// Sheldon: (Strangled sound)// (Strangled sound)// Scene: The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.// Colonel Williams: And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?// Leonard: Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.// Colonel Williams: Well, I’m a scientist by training.// Howard: Really? You’re a physicist?// Colonel Williams: Better. I’m an engineer.// Leonard: Where did you go to school?// Colonel Williams: MIT.// Howard: Oh. Well, hey, me, too.// Colonel Williams: I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I’ll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there’s an application for this technology, and we’re interested in funding your research.// Howard: Well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons.// Colonel Williams: Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.// Leonard: I don’t know how I feel about this.// Colonel Williams: Look, guys, it’s just a guidance system. It’s not like you’re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it’s this big, and we need it to be this big.// Leonard: That’s a lot less big.// Colonel Williams: Yes, it’s this much less big.// Howard: I’m not even sure that’s possible.// Colonel Williams: Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.// Howard: Four months?// Sheldon: Yeah, we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren’t real scientists, MIT’s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.// Amy: Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.// Bernadette: Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.// Amy: I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.// Bernadette: Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?// Amy: Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?// Bernadette: I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing.// Amy: You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?// Bernadette: Are you kidding? I’ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s I wonder if her mommy// knows where she is.// Amy: I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.// Bernadette: I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant.// Amy: I understand how you feel.// Bernadette: Thank you.// Amy: I wish there were some way I could make it better.// Bernadette: Well, you brought me French fries. That’s a start.// Amy: Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant.// Bernadette: Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?// Amy: I’ll be right back.// Bernadette: And a chocolate shake.// Penny: What are you doing?// Sheldon: Oh, Leonard’s mad at me, so I’m making him lemon bars.// Penny: Does he even like lemon bars?// Sheldon: Not really. But I’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.// Penny: Something happen at the meeting?// Sheldon: They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.// Penny: And you talked?// Sheldon: Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me.// Penny: Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too.// Sheldon: Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.// Penny: Why would that make me feel better?// Sheldon: Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.// Penny: Okay. Never mind.// Sheldon: Look, I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.// Penny: Well, I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know.// Sheldon: Why would you do that?// Penny: Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.// Sheldon: See, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.// Raj: Is it even possible to get this done in two months?// Howard: Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.// Leonard: Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.// Howard: I love your French toast.// Leonard: Oh, thanks, man.// Raj: So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?// Howard: We didn’t. Sheldon did.// Raj: And you just let him?// Leonard: Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.// Howard: No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.// Raj: So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while.// Leonard: Oh, looks like it.// Raj: Wow. You’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.// Howard: Would you stop? We’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.// Raj: And right here.// Howard: You are a deeply silly man.// Raj: He is so afraid of his feelings.// Scene: Outside Penny’s door.// Penny: Oh, hi.// Bernadette: Got a minute?// Penny: Yeah, come on in.// Bernadette: I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.// Penny: Oh, thank you, and I’m sorry I lied about it.// Bernadette: For what it’s worth, you’re a great liar.// Penny: Oh, that’s what Amy said. So what’s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?// Bernadette: Well, my boss said he hadn’t decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy, and I’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury.// Penny: You threatened to sue?// Bernadette: Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch, that’s where you punch.// Penny: That’s funny. I learned something totally different.// Bernadette: Do you know what? It’s just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It’s all I need to give my life meaning.// Penny: Oh, that’s so beautiful.// Bernadette: You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I’ll have the jury eating out of my hand.// Scene: A corridor at the university.// Sheldon: I never realized this building was classified.// Howard: Maybe that’s because it’s classified.// Leonard: Wish we weren’t so far from my parking space.// Sheldon: The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing.// Leonard: I’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.// Sheldon: Why? It clearly doesn’t work.// Howard: I guess this is it.// Leonard: Is that a retinal scanner?// Howard: Let’s find out.// Scanner: Howard Wolowitz, access granted.// Leonard: No way.// Sheldon: Impressive.// Leonard: Oh, my turn, my turn.// Scanner: Leonard Hofstadter, access granted.// Leonard: I didn’t even have to take my glasses off/// Scanner (as Leonard and Sheldon try to fool it with one eye each): Access denied.// (as Leonard and Sheldon try to fool it with one eye each)// Leonard and Sheldon: It knows.// Howard: Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down.// All: Yay.Series 10 Episode 03 -The Dependence Transcendence// Scene: The new laboratory.// Howard: It’s pretty late. You think I’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?// Leonard: Sure, I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.// Sheldon: Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts.// Howard: What?// Sheldon: It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all.// Howard: Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere.// Leonard: We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.// Sheldon: I know, I was there.// Howard: Well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights.// Sheldon: How late?// Howard: Well, I don’t know, midnight, one.// Sheldon: One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.// Howard: If you’re tired, have some coffee.// Sheldon: What? You have some coffee.// Howard: I am having coffee.// Sheldon: And look how irritable it’s making you!// Leonard: Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try// to soldier through?// Sheldon: Fine. (Time passing montage) I don’t think I can go much longer.// (Time passing montage)// Leonard: It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.// Leonard: Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.// Penny: Good morning.// Leonard: What is this?// Amy: Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.// Leonard: Oh, that is so nice.// Sheldon: Ow, it does hurt.// Leonard: So, what are you guys gonna do today?// Amy: Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don’t think that’s happening.// Sheldon: Oh, that was never happening.// Penny: Oh, I’ll go. I like a party.// Amy: Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry.// Penny: It’s okay, I’ll still go.// Leonard: You don’t think you’ll be bored?// Penny: Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?// Sheldon: I won’t be there.// Leonard: : Look at that, it is a party.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: Sorry I have to work all weekend.// Bernadette: It’s okay.// Howard: Thanks again for breakfast.// Raj: Well, I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.// Bernadette: You shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.// Raj: So, what should we do today?// Bernadette: Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me.// Raj: Well, I don’t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?// Bernadette: Not really.// Raj: Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.// Bernadette: I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother’s for Christmas.// Raj: Oh, I know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?// Bernadette: Isn’t it a little early for that?// Raj: You have to get to it eventually.// Bernadette: Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing.// Raj: How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.// Bernadette: I don’t think you are.// Raj: You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.// Scene: In the university, Sheldon is asleep against a vending machine.// Voice: Psst, hey, kid.// Sheldon: Huh, what?// The Flash (the voice): You look tired. Why don’t you have an energy drink? Everyone’s doing it.// (the voice)// Sheldon: Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.// The Flash: Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.// Sheldon: I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin.// The Flash: All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.// Sheldon: Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?// The Flash: You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.// Sheldon: I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.// The Flash: Here. It’s on the house.// Sheldon: The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?// The Flash: You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.// Scene: Bert’s apartment.// Amy: Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.// Penny: Hi.// Bert: Hey, come on in. I’ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That’s a geology joke.// Amy: Bert’s a geologist.// Bert: And a joker.// Penny: How early are we?// Amy: Oh, actually, we’re an hour late.// Penny: I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s spare room.// Bernadette: I don’t even know where to begin.// Raj: Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.// Bernadette: Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here.// Raj: Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.// Bernadette: Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.// Raj: Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?// Bernadette: My dad built it for me.// Raj: Wow, it’s so cute.// Bernadette: This was the husband and this was the wife. They’d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.// Raj: Oh, and did they have kids?// Bernadette: They did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.// Raj: Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all.// Bernadette: Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. And it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.// Raj: I skipped spin class for this.// Scene: The lab.// Howard: Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?// Leonard: Oh, it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine// uncomfortably intimate.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.// Leonard: Are you okay?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers.// Howard: You wanted him awake.// Penny: So should we talk to each other or mingle?// Amy: I don’t know where everyone is.// Penny: Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.// Bert: Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don’t have to stay. I’m gonna start cleaning up.// Amy: Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.// Penny: Oh, it’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.// Bert: Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ’cause you’re you and I’m me, and it’s kind of embarrassing.// Penny: Wait, what do you mean she’s her?// Bert: Well, you know how Amy’s the coolest girl on campus, right?// Penny: No.// Amy: No.// Bert: Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.// Penny: What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?// Amy: I’m sure it’s just ’cause I’m dating Sheldon.// Bert: Mm, actually, I think Sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you.// Penny: Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?// Howard: Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?// Leonard: According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two.// Sheldon: My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.// Howard: Why don’t you just go home?// Sheldon: No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.// Leonard: What?// Sheldon: I want another one.// Leonard: So?// Sheldon: That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.// Leonard: You only had one.// Sheldon: No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop.// Howard: You can’t develop a problem that fast.// Sheldon: You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling.// Leonard: We can’t afford to lose any more time.// Howard: Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?// Leonard: That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?// Sheldon: I’m sorry. Yes, of course.// Leonard: Thank you.// Sheldon: Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.// Howard: No worries.// Sheldon: You guys stink.// Bernadette: Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones.// Raj: I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?// Bernadette: Does it really need one?// Raj: Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?// Bernadette: Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.// Raj: Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.// Bernadette: Are you just gonna name all the colours?// Raj: Well, not now.// Bernadette: I don’t care what colour the room is.// Raj: Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you.// Bernadette: Well, you’re not, so just drop it. (Off) I’m clearly upset. Why aren’t you following me?// (Off)// Raj: Sorry. Sorry.// Bert: And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.// Penny: You trend setter.// Amy: Just the right idea at the right time.// Penny: Okay, okay, so Amy’s cool, Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard.// Bert: Who?// Penny: Leonard Hofstadter.// Bert: Oh, him. I guess he’s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.// Penny: That’s me, I’m her. You know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down.// Bert: It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.// Amy: And you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.// Penny: You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.// Amy: Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart.// Penny: Wow, you popular girls are mean.// Leonard: I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?// Sheldon: Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?// Leonard: Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem.// Sheldon: I do.// Leonard: You don’t.// Sheldon: Yeah, but I do.// Leonard: No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?// Sheldon: With what?// Leonard: Your problem.// Sheldon: I thought I didn’t have a problem.// Howard: That was painful to watch.// Scene: Bernadette’s car.// Raj: So where are we going?// Bernadette: I don’t know.// Raj: Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.// Bernadette: Raj, why don’t I care about anything?// Raj: I’m sorry?// Bernadette: It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?// Raj: Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.// Bernadette: I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?// Raj: Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.// Bernadette: Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.// Raj: Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story.// Sheldon: Leonard, can I ask you a question?// Leonard: Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?// Sheldon: Howard, can I ask you a question?// Howard: No.// Sheldon: All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…// Leonard: Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care.// Sheldon: You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.// Leonard: Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.// Sheldon: I can’t.// Leonard: Yes, you can.// Sheldon: No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing.// Leonard: Seriously?// Sheldon: I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.// Leonard: It’s okay, we’ll figure something out.// Sheldon: But what if we can’t?// Leonard: It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy? (Sheldon snores)// (Sheldon snores)// Howard: When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.// Bert’s apartment.// Amy: Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.// Bert: My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?// Amy: I think we’re good.// Bert: Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people.// Penny: Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.// Bert: You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now.// Penny: Okay.// Amy: Bye.// Raj: Uh, pull over.// Bernadette: What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you.// Raj: Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.// Dr Koothrapalli (on facetime): Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?// (on facetime)// Raj: What? No.// Dr Koothrapalli: Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?// Raj: No.// Dr Koothrapalli: Great. What’s up?// Raj: This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.// Dr Koothrapalli: Of course. What seems to be the trouble?// Bernadette: Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies.// Dr Koothrapalli: Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby.// Bernadette: But I thought I’d be more excited.// Dr Koothrapalli: Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.// Bernadette: Thank you. I feel better now.// Raj: Well I don’t.// Dr Koothrapalli: Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.// Scene: Colonel Williams’ office.// Leonard: Um, I don’t really know how to say this.// Colonel Williams: Well, you could try starting with sir.// Leonard: Right. Sorry, sir.// Sheldon: He said start with it, not end with it.// Leonard: Sir.// Colonel Williams: Hmm?// Howard: We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule.// Sheldon: The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.// Leonard: I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.// Colonel Williams: How long do you need?// Howard: We, we’re thinking, two years.// Colonel Williams: All right.// Howard: That’s it? You’re okay with that?// Colonel Williams: What, you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time? We’re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.// Leonard: Thanks for understanding, sir.// Howard: Yes, thank you so much.// Sheldon: We, we really appreciate it.// Leonard (off): All right, pressure’s off// (off)// Howard (off): Wanna see a movie?// Sheldon (off): Popcorn’s on me.Series 10 Episode 04 – The Cohabitation Experimentation// Scene: The foyer.// Amy: And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.// Leonard: That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?// Amy: About five weeks.// Penny: Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?// Amy: Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.// Penny: Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?// Amy: They didn’t say.// Leonard: Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.// Penny: Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.// Amy: Really?// Penny: Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place.// Amy: You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?// Penny: No, not at all.// Leonard: And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.// Amy: So, technically, I’d be moving in with my boyfriend?// Penny: I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.// Amy: Oh, my, this is a big step.// Leonard: Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction.// Sheldon: Why are you all smiling like crazy people?// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.// Leonard: It’s only for five weeks.// Penny: Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall.// Amy: What do you think?// Sheldon: I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?// Penny: Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.// Sheldon: Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven.// Leonard: You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.// Amy: Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?// Sheldon: Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.// Leonard: Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.// Sheldon: If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it.// Penny: Don’t be proud of that.// Amy: So, is that a yes?// Sheldon: Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.// Penny: Well, where would you go?// Sheldon: Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.// Leonard: And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914// Penny: Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?// Sheldon: Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here.// Leonard: That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.// Sheldon: Historically, I don’t do well with change.// Penny: Okay, it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone.// Sheldon: You’re darn right, you wouldn’t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.// Leonard: Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.// Amy: Sheldon, what do you think?// Sheldon: Very well. I’m on board.// Amy: Seriously?// Sheldon: Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.// Amy: Oh. This is so exciting.// Sheldon: Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Raj: I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.// Howard: Cool. ‘Cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.// Raj: I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.// Bernadette: It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.// Raj: The polite response is, thank you for noticing.// Bernadette: Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.// Howard: Yeah, we could name him Blobert.// Bernadette: What if it’s a girl?// Howard: Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.// Bernadette: Are we being silly not finding out the sex?// Howard: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.// Raj: If you want, you can find out right now.// Howard: Mm.// Bernadette: Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter.// Raj: Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.// Bernadette: You looked in our folder?!// Raj: It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.// Howard: So you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?// Raj: Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.// Howard: It’s unbelievable.// Bernadette: God, Raj.// Raj: What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you.// Bernadette: We don’t want you to know.// Raj: Okay, well, that’s a problem.// Scene: Penny’s apartment.// Penny: You know, I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.// Sheldon: Oh. Thank you.// Penny: Mm.// Sheldon: Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done.// Penny: That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?// Sheldon: Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?// Penny: Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.// Sheldon: You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.// Amy: You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?// Leonard: I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this.// Cutting between Penny’s apartment and Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment.// Penny: I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.// Leonard: Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.// Penny: Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.// Leonard: Keep M&M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.// Penny: You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space.// Leonard: He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.// Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.// Sheldon: How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?// Amy: I don’t know. I didn’t count.// Sheldon: You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.// Amy: That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?// Sheldon: Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.// Amy: Well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.// Sheldon: Okay. Talk.// Amy: Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.// Sheldon: Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.// Amy: Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it.// Sheldon: You’re really okay with that?// Amy: I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.// Sheldon: This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now.// Amy: Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.// Sheldon: I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.// Scene: The hallway.// Penny: Well, here’s your key.// Amy: Thank you.// Sheldon: Enjoy having the place to yourselves.// Leonard: You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.// Sheldon: It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.// Penny: Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional.// Amy: Shall we?// Sheldon: I guess this is it.// Leonard: You guys have fun.// Sheldon: You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.// Penny: Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.// Sheldon: Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.// Leonard: I’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together.// Sheldon: Leonard, please, let me go.// Amy: Come on, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh. Bye.// Leonard: Good night.// Penny: Good night.// Amy: Well, that’s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.// Sheldon: I guess the experiment begins.// Penny (off, screaming): Wa-how, we did it.// (off, screaming)// Leonard (off, also screaming): Yeah.// (off, also screaming)// Scene: Penny’s bedroom.// Sheldon: Which side of the bed would you prefer?// Amy: Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice.// Sheldon: No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.// Amy: Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.// Sheldon: Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.// Amy: Well, I’m not refusing. I’m just trying to be considerate.// Sheldon: Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?// Amy: Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?// Sheldon: Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.// Amy: Great. That’s your side.// Sheldon: No, but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack.// Amy: Okay, I’ll take that side.// Sheldon: Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?// Amy: Rising rapidly.// Sheldon: Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.// Amy: Okay. What if we do this?// Sheldon: I suppose that works.// Amy: Great.// Sheldon: Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Bernadette: This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?// Howard: I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?// Bernadette: I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.// Howard: But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.// Bernadette: Everyone said I could do better.// Howard: But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da.// Amy (off): Ugh. What is that? (Entering) Why did you switch sides?// (Entering)// Sheldon: Be grateful I’m still in the room.// Amy: Comfy?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers.// Amy: Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.// Sheldon: Well, it’s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.// Amy: Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall.// Sheldon: Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it.// Leonard: That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night.// Penny: Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.// Leonard: It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different.// Penny: So, what do you want to do?// Leonard: I know exactly what we are gonna do.// Penny: Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?// Leonard: Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.// Penny: Ugh. Can we just have sex?// Leonard: Oh, don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.// Penny: Inevitable, you say?// Leonard: I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.// Howard: Screw it. I’m calling and finding out.// Bernadette: Good. Call him. Wait, I’m not sure I want to know.// Howard: But you just said you wanted to know.// Bernadette: Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!// Raj: Hello?// Howard: Call you back.// Sheldon: No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn.// Penny: Wow, where did you learn these moves?// Leonard: The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.// Howard: Okay, you’re positive you want to know?// Bernadette: Yes.// Howard: Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing.// Bernadette: Wait.// Howard: Wrong number.// Penny: I told you not to do the worm.// Leonard: You were right.// Scene: Raj’s bedroom. Phone rings.// Raj: Hello.// Bernadette (off): I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.// (off)// Amy: Oh, oh, oh.// Sheldon: What are you doing down there?// Amy: Hang on.// Sheldon: Who are you calling? Aaargh!// Amy: I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night.// Penny: Yeah, get it, girl.// Amy: It’s not what you think.// Leonard: I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?// Penny: Even more not what you think.// Amy: I don’t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.// Leonard: If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.// Penny: Yeah.// Sheldon: Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?// Amy: Miserable and exhausted.// Sheldon: Really? I slept great.// Amy: Well, I didn’t, and it’s your fault.// Sheldon: How? You had the whole floor to yourself.// Amy: Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.// Sheldon: Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?// Amy: The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.// Sheldon: Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.// Amy: I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?// Sheldon: If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.// Penny: Was that a science diss?// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny: Was it a good one?// Leonard: Eh.// Penny: Oh.// Amy: What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables.// Sheldon: How dare you?// Amy: Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.// Sheldon: Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?// Amy: Can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.// Penny: I feel like I should say damn.// Leonard: Do it.// Penny: Damn.// Sheldon: Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.// Amy: Well, for science, maybe I will.// Sheldon: For science, maybe you should.// Amy: Fine.// Sheldon: Fine.// Amy: Good.// Sheldon: Great.// Amy: Do you want to go to our place and make out?// Sheldon: Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?// Penny: The new neighbours are weird.Series 10 Episode 05 – The Hot Tub Contamination// Following a previously on scene…// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Okay, I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?// Leonard: I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.// Sheldon: Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?// Penny: Can’t.// Leonard: Won’t.// Penny: Didn’t.// Leonard: Don’t.// Amy: I told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives.// Sheldon: I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.// Amy: I’m sorry for bringing this over here.// Penny: Believe me, we know what you’re going through.// Leonard: And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.// Penny: Mm-hmm.// Amy: Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise.// Penny: She’s right. That’s reasonable.// Sheldon: Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.// Leonard: Hey, she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference.// Penny: Yeah. You tell him, babe.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The comic book store.// Raj: What time do you and Bernadette head out?// Howard: As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark.// Raj: I’ve never been to Palm Springs.// Stuart: Oh, you should go. It’s terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.// Raj: I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.// Stuart: It’s nice you and Bernadette are getting away.// Howard: Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.// Stuart: So then what are you doing here buying comic books?// Howard: Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.// Leonard: When you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.// Sheldon: Well I’m open to that.// Amy: Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.// Penny: Sheldon, what do you say to that?// Sheldon: I think we should see other people.// Amy: What?// Sheldon: Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.// Amy: We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?// Sheldon: Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here.// Amy: You wanna see other people? Go see other people.// Penny: I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas.// Leonard: Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here.// Penny: All right. Well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.// Leonard: Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.// Penny: So it’s okay for you to joke around?// Leonard: No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Howard: Honey, how ya feeling? (Sound of Bernadette vomiting violently) The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away. (More vomiting) So that’s good news, right?// (Sound of Bernadette vomiting violently)// (More vomiting)// Bernadette (pff): The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.// B// (pff):// Howard: There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?// Bernadette: Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.// Howard: I’m sorry. We don’t have to go.// Bernadette: But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.// Howard: How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home.// Bernadette: Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.// Howard: Does it sound sexy?// Bernadette: You just heard me throwing up.// Howard: You bet I did.// Bernadette: You’re so weird.// Howard: You know what’s weird? How turned on you are right now.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Sheldon: You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.// Penny: Just as challenging?// Sheldon: Yes.// Penny: As you?// Penny: Just as challenging as you?// Sheldon: When we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto// and headed for the storm cellar.// Penny: Leonard breathes on me, too. It’s not a big deal.// Sheldon: She’s always complaining about people at work.// Penny: Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world.// Sheldon: Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?// Penny: You know, so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.// Sheldon: I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.// Penny: Agreed. Thank you.// Bernadette: That feels great.// Howard: Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?// Bernadette: Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?// Howard: It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house.// Bernadette: Lock the door, lock the door.// Howard: We should call the police.// Bernadette: Uh, I left my phone downstairs.// Howard: Damn, so did I.// Bernadette: Wait, I have my iPad.// Howard: What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?// Bernadette: That’s not helpful.// Howard: You know I rely on humour in times of stress.// Bernadette: Let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny.// Howard: Is that the hot tub?// Bernadette: Who would use our hot tub?// Howard: Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.// Bernadette: Who is it?// Howard: Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?// Bernadette: Should we say something to him?// Howard: Maybe. How ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?// Bernadette: I meant like, what are you doing here?// Howard: Nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings.// Amy: Why is nothing easy with him?// Leonard: Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst.// Amy: I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.// Leonard: I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.// Amy: I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.// Leonard: Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before.// Amy: That’s true.// Leonard: And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?// Amy: You’re not making me feel better.// Leonard: Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier.// Amy: He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap.// Leonard: Yeah. My record was six.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Bernadette: Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?// Howard: Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?// Bernadette: Is someone else here?// Raj: Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?// Stuart: What are you doing here?// Raj: Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.// Stuart: Did they?// Raj: Answer the question, what are you doing here?// Stuart: I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they’re not home.// Bernadette: What?// Stuart: They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon.// Bernadette: I told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.// Penny: You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.// Sheldon: Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?// Penny: Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.// Sheldon: If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.// Penny: Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream.// Sheldon: Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.// Penny: Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?// Sheldon: Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.// Penny: You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.// Raj: Here you go.// Stuart: Thank you.// Raj: Shall we toast?// Stuart: To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.// Bernadette: You said you got it back.// Howard: Well, clearly, I lied.// Raj: So how’s your apartment?// Stuart: Not great. The electricity’s out.// Raj: So why don’t you get it fixed?// Stuart: I called, and they’re like, pay your bill.// Raj: If you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place.// Stuart: Oh, no. I don’t want to be an inconvenience. You’ve got all your lady friends, and…// Raj: Actually, I’m single now.// Stuart: What? When did that happen?// Raj: It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well, their choice, and it’s not okay.// Stuart: Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know.// Raj: Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.// Bernadette: Why wouldn’t he tell us? Are we bad friends?// Howard: He’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.// Bernadette: Yeah, he deserves to be alone.// Stuart: So you’re back out on the dating scene now?// Raj: Yeah, yeah, a little.// Stuart: Oh, that must be fun. How’s that going?// Raj: I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.// Amy: Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.// Leonard: No, don’t do that.// Amy: But you did.// Leonard: Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby.// Amy: It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.// Leonard: Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?// Amy: Me.// Leonard: And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?// Amy: Me. It was mittens.// Leonard: And who got him to try a turkey dog?// Amy: That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.// Leonard: How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.// Amy: You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.// Leonard: Of course you do.// Amy: And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here.// Leonard: Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.// Scene: An ice-cream parlour.// Penny: Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite.// Sheldon: No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.// Penny: What about the girl behind the counter?// Sheldon: Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other.// Penny: Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?// Sheldon: You are truly wise.// Penny: Thank you.// Sheldon: I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there.// Penny: All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?// Sheldon: Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone.// Penny: All right.// Sheldon: I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.// Penny: Not relating. Go on.// Sheldon: I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.// Penny: Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay.// Sheldon: My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.// Penny: Oh, that’s awful.// Sheldon: I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first// one’s traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.// Penny: Well, what happened with your dad?// Sheldon: We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.// Penny: You poor thing.// Sheldon: Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to.// Penny: And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?// Sheldon: Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.// Penny: Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.// Sheldon: Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.// Penny: Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?// Sheldon: I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.// Penny: Okay.// Sheldon: That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.// Penny: Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.// Raj: I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.// Stuart: I don’t know. Bernadette’s baby doesn’t have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.// Howard: Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.// Bernadette: What do you do in there?// Howard: It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know.// Raj: Well, it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home.// Stuart: Yeah, you’re probably right.// Raj: You coming?// Stuart: Yeah, just give me a minute.// Raj: Why?// Stuart: Well, you know how you’re wearing a bathing suit?// Raj: Yeah?// Stuart: I kind of went the other way.// Howard: You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!// Leonard: What do you think?// Amy: It’s a nice enough spot. You know, if I’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…// Penny: We’re back.// Amy: Oh, hi. Hi.// Sheldon: Hello.// Leonard: How you guys doing?// Penny: We’re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.// Sheldon: I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.// Amy: Oh. Really?// Leonard: Why does she get that? We never got that.// Penny: Do you want him back?// Leonard: I’m very happy for you.// Sheldon: Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level.// Scene: Amy and Sheldon’s bathroom.// Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?// Amy: I would love to.// Leonard: Did we really need to be here for this?// Penny: Call me crazy, but I found it moving.Series 10 Episode 06 – The Foetal Kick Catalyst// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?// Leonard: ‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?// Penny: I got asked to sign autographs there.// Leonard: That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?// Penny: Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.// Leonard: When is it?// Penny: It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.// Leonard: What? Why not?// Penny: You just said yourself, it’s sad.// Leonard: Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun.// Penny: I don’t know.// Leonard: You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble.// Penny: I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.// Leonard: Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.// Penny: Oh, yeah.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.// Sheldon: We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.// Amy: You know what I meant.// Sheldon: All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop.// Amy: I’m sorry I mentioned it.// Sheldon: Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Howard: That’s a kick. That’s an actual kick.// Bernadette: What are you doing?// Howard: I felt a kick. There’s a baby in there.// Bernadette: Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it.// Howard: Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.// Bernadette: Which MIT did you go to?// Howard: Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!// Bernadette: Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.// Howard: Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.// Bernadette: The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.// Howard: Are we even in a good school…? Ow!// Bernadette: I warned you, and I did it.// Penny: What’s all this?// Leonard: Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.// Penny: Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.// Leonard: Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.// Penny: Who’s that?// Leonard: Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?// Penny: Oh, there’s so much I want to change.// Leonard: Yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck.// Amy: What’s going on here?// Sheldon: You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.// Amy: Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?// Sheldon: Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.// Amy: You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?// Sheldon: Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.// Amy: That’s an odd mix of people.// Sheldon: Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.// Amy: You never went into that haunted house.// Sheldon: You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.// Amy: Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises.// Amy: Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have// expected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised, but as it is, I didn’t know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.// Sheldon: Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: Hi.// Bernadette: Hey, where you been?// Howard: Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.// Raj: Wait till you see the crib we found.// Bernadette: You bought a crib without me?// Howard: You’re gonna love it.// Raj: Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.// Bernadette: Sounds expensive.// Howard: Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety.// Raj: Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting.// Howard: But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it.// Bernadette: Fine.// Howard: In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?// Bernadette: You bought a minivan?// Howard: It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.// Raj: Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.// Bernadette: I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.// Howard: The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore.// Raj: Then again, he did think you were my husband.// Bernadette: They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?// Scene: The Comic-con.// Leonard: Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.// Penny: Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.// Leonard: Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour.// Penny: Alright, why not five and ten bucks?// Leonard: Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.// Penny: Hey, that guy’s looking over here.// Leonard: Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?// Penny: I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi.// Guy: Hi. I love your movie.// Penny: Well, thanks.// Guy: It has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in my life.// Penny: Your love confuses me.// Leonard: Would you like an autograph?// Guy: Sure.// Penny: Okay. Who do I make it out to?// Guy: Daniel.// Penny: Okay.// Daniel: I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?// Penny: That did not clear things up.// Leonard: That’ll be four seventy-five.// Daniel: Keep the change.// Leonard: But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.// Amy: There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.// Sheldon: The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.// Amy: Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.// Sheldon: Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.// Bert: I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.// Amy: How old was it// Bert: It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it.// Sheldon: Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?// Mrs Petrescu: Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee’s.// Sheldon: She’s learning English from TV.// Mrs Petrescu: TV, good. Now back to you.// Stuart: Hey, guys.// Amy: Hi, Stuart.// Stuart: These are for you.// Amy: Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you.// Sheldon: Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.// Stuart: Nice to meet you.// Mrs Petrescu: Hello.// Bert: Hey.// Stuart: So, what did I miss?// Bert: Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.// Mrs Petrescu: 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.// Stuart: Anybody else coming to this thing?// Penny: What’s your name?// Jeff: Jeff.// Jeff: My favourite part is your shower scene.// Penny: Been hearing that a lot today.// Jeff: I even have a screen grab on my phone.// Penny: Yep, there they are.// Leonard: Okay, let’s keep it moving.// Penny: Here you go.// Leonard: Should’ve punched that guy.// Penny: Well, go ahead. He’s right over there.// Leonard: Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?// Penny: Hello.// Awkward guy: Hi. I like your movies.// Penny: Thank you.// Awkward guy: I saw both of them.// Penny: I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.// Awkward guy: You think I could get a picture of us?// Penny: Oh, sure.// Awkward guy: And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?// Leonard: No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?// Penny: Leonard…// Leonard: No, no, no. It’s not okay.// Awkward guy: Who are you?// Leonard: I’m her husband.// Awkward guy: No, you’re not.// Leonard: I am.// Penny: Yeah, he really is.// Awkward guy: No.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s garage.// Howard: It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future.// Raj: Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.// Howard: Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?// Bernadette: I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?// Howard: You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.// Raj: No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.// Howard: Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?// Bernadette: It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.// Howard: Yes.// Raj: Yes.// Howard: See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.// Bernadette: Oh, is it your back?// Howard: Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.// Sheldon: So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.// Bert: I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.// Amy: Things didn’t work out?// Bert: I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I’m warning you, hide your good rocks.// Mrs Petrescu: My sister’s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.// Stuart: Really, no one else is coming?// Sheldon: This is it. You are the practice round.// Stuart: Practice round? For-for what?// Amy: Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.// Sheldon: You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.// Stuart: So, I’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?// Sheldon: Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.// Amy: Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people.// Sheldon: Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.// Awkward guy: But how did you get her to go out with you?// Leonard: Well, she moved in across the hall.// Penny: And he started to slowly wear me down.// Leonard: Like a river carves a canyon.// Penny: Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.// Red-haired guy: Ready to go?// Awkward guy: Hang on. This guy’s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.// Red-haired guy: This guy? But he’s wearing a change maker.// Penny: I think it’s hot.// Leonard: That’s right. I’m her change daddy.// Scene: The minivan.// Howard: Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.// Bernadette: Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.// Howard: You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.// Bernadette: Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.// Howard: You’re right. It sells itself.// Raj: You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride.// Bernadette: I was hoping it’d be quieter.// Howard: If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?// Bernadette: Soon.// Howard: Why is it taking so long?// Raj: Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite.// Howard: I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one.// Raj: I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.// Bernadette: Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.// Bert: This is the best blintz I’ve ever had.// Sheldon: Oh. Thank you.// Bert: It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.// Stuart: You know what, I, I, I think I’m just gonna go.// Amy: No, Stuart, don’t.// Stuart: No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I’m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?// Amy: We’re so sorry.// Stuart: I’m always the last one anybody thinks of.// Sheldon: Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority.// Stuart: Bye.// Sheldon: Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.// Bert: I know how it feels, too.// Sheldon: All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.// Stuart: Thank you.// Sheldon: You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.// Bert: Hear, hear.// Amy: Cheers.// Mrs Petrescu: Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.// Leonard: And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.// Awkward guy: Oh. Whoa. I didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times.// Leonard: The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.// Penny: You know, once, I proposed to him.// Leonard: Yeah. I said no.// Red-haired guy: Why?// Leonard: I just wanted to make her work for it.// Penny: Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later.// Red-haired guy: Hang on. Is she just with you because you’re rich?// Leonard: She makes more money than I do.// Awkward guy: What? Who are you?// Sheldon: Do you know what else I love about you?// Stuart: Hmm?// Sheldon: Your handwriting is impeccable.// Stuart: Thank you for noticing.// Sheldon: No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker.// Stuart: You know what I love about you?// Sheldon: Hmm?// Stuart: You never leave the house without a paper clip.// Sheldon: You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.// Stuart: I also love how you never use swear words.// Sheldon: You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em.// Amy: Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.// Sheldon: Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.Series 10 Episode 07 – The Veracity Elasticity// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.// Amy: And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.// Sheldon: And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…// Both: Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags.// Sheldon: Hit it.// Howard (singing): For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.// (singing)// Raj (singing): What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist.// Together: Fun with flags, fun with flags.// Howard: Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags.// Together: Fun with flags.// Amy: As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.// Sheldon: Who haven’t learned their place yet.// Amy: We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.// Sheldon: Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.// Amy: So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.// Sheldon: So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis. (Drumroll) Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.// (Drumroll)// (Cut to Penny, Leonard and Bernadette watching in the apartment opposite)// Amy: Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…// Penny: I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?// Leonard: It’s cute, they’re having fun living together.// Penny: Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.// Bernadette: Actually, it’s been ready for weeks.// Leonard: What do you mean?// Bernadette: Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule.// Leonard: So, she’s just been lying to him?// Penny: Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon.// Leonard: Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.// Sheldon: Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.// Howard: Oh, right. (Drumroll)// Credits sequence.// Sheldon: Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.// Howard: Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny.// Raj: We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?// Amy: It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?// Sheldon: Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.// Amy: Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone.// Sheldon: So?// Amy: Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?// Sheldon: I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.// Amy: Anyway, how about dinner?// Sheldon: You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain.// Amy: Thanks, but you don’t have to.// Sheldon: Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold.// Amy: Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?// Sheldon: Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?// Amy: No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?// Sheldon: I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Howard: I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.// Leonard: So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?// Raj: If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?// Leonard: You’re awful quiet, everything okay?// Sheldon: I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.// Howard: Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?// Sheldon: Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something.// Leonard: I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.// Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.// Howard: You heard him, guys, don’t ask.// Sheldon: Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.// Leonard: Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.// Sheldon: I don’t understand.// Leonard: She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.// Sheldon: So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?// Leonard: Yes.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.// Raj: Oh my God, that’s who you look like.// Leonard: Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it.// Raj: Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.// Howard: And how single are you right now?// Raj: Eating cake on the toilet single.// Sheldon: Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.// Howard: Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face.// Leonard: Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.// Howard: So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?// Leonard: Well, of course not.// Howard: So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?// Leonard: Uh, no.// Howard: I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.// Leonard: Are you kidding me?// Howard: See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.// Scene: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.// Leonard: Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone.// Sheldon: Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.// Leonard: I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month.// Sheldon: It’s khoo-vakh.// Leonard: Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.// Sheldon: No, no, he’s over there.// Leonard: Oh, yeah, there he is.// Scene: The stairwell.// Penny: So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?// Amy: Um, it was a drywall problem.// Penny: Oh, no, what happened?// Amy: Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…// Penny: Wet wall?// Amy: Or damp wall, just as bad.// Penny: Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?// Amy: Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…// Penny: Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready.// Amy: I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go.// Penny: But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?// Amy: Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this.// Penny: Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.// Amy: Thanks.// Penny: The woman at the wall store?// Amy: Let it go.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Are you going to confront Penny?// Leonard: Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.// Sheldon: Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.// Leonard: Oh, my God, I’m going blind.// Penny: Hi.// Amy: Food’s here.// Sheldon: Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?// Amy: Oh, uh, they’re still working on it.// Sheldon: Interesting. Very interesting.// Penny: Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.// Sheldon: Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?// Penny: I did, still a mess.// Sheldon: Leonard?// s// Leonard: Yeah?// Sheldon: jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny? (I don’t understand, is Penny lying?)// Leonard: jISovbe’ (I don’t know.)// Amy: Why are you speaking Klingon?// Sheldon: Why are you speaking English?// Amy: This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?// Penny: Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.// Amy: Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?// Penny: Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit’s pubossubibuble.// Sheldon: Oh, wait, stop that.// Amy: You stop that.// Sheldon: Dayaj’a’ (Do you understand them?)// Leonard: ghobe’ (No.)// Sheldon: Qu’vatlh (Damn it.)// Penny: Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?// Leonard: Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused.// Amy: Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.// Sheldon: How could you lie to me?// Penny: Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love.// Leonard: Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?// Penny: What? Tha… That is not true.// Leonard: Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.// Penny: Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.// Leonard: You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?// Penny: Uh, did you notice your key chain?// Leonard: Where’s Batman?// Bernadette: Hey.// Penny: Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?// Bernadette: One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?// Howard: It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv (Who knows the status of Amy’s apartment?)// Amy: Everybody stop it with that.// Raj: I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in.// Amy: And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.// Howard: You’re up, blabby.// Bernadette: Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.// Amy: I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.// Sheldon: It’s all right.// Leonard: And?// Penny: And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.// Raj: Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?// Sheldon: Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.// Amy: Are you saying you’d like to live with me?// Sheldon: I’m open to the possibility.// Penny: Ubamy bube cubool.// Amy: Whatever.// Howard: You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything.// Penny: That’s a great idea.// Leonard: Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.// Raj: That would be amazing.// Sheldon: Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room.// Leonard: But you won’t be living here.// Sheldon: But that’s my room.// Leonard: You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.// Penny: Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.// Everyone: But you won’t be living here.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.// Amy: Thank you for understanding.// Sheldon: Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.// Amy: Good night.// Sheldon: Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?// Amy: I don’t know. It, it could be.// Sheldon: Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment.// Amy: Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.// Sheldon: I hate your apartment.// Amy: Sorry, you brought it up?// Sheldon: Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.// Amy: It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.// Sheldon: But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: I’m not a child, don’t do that.// Amy: Sorry.// Sheldon: Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that’s soothing.// Scene: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom// Leonard: Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours.// Penny: Thank you.// Leonard: Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.// Penny: Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.// Leonard: I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.// Penny: Do you really mean that?// Leonard: I really do.// Penny: Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.// Leonard: Yeah? What are you keeping?// Penny: That candle and you.// Leonard: What about my robot poster?// Penny: Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.// Amy: What’s going on?// Sheldon: I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.// Amy: Can it be more of an internal struggle?// Sheldon: I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow.// Amy: How about if I just don’t breathe at all?// Sheldon: That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?// Leonard: Oh, hey, Sheldon.// Penny: We turned your room into a sex dungeon.// Sheldon (waking up in bed): No.// (waking up in bed)// Amy: What is happening?// Scene: The comic book store.// Howard: Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?// Sheldon: Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?// Raj: We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?// Leonard: Over my assless chaps you will.// Howard: This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?// Sheldon: Yes.// Raj: Do you like living with her?// Leonard: Do you know what you need to do now?// Sheldon: Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all.// Amy: Hi.// Sheldon: Hello.// Amy: What are you doing?// Sheldon: I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.// Amy: I understand. I’ll leave you be.// Sheldon: What, you’re familiar with the reference?// Amy: Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.// Sheldon: Exactly.// Amy: Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Amy: You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.// Sheldon: Really?// Amy: Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.// Sheldon: Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.// Amy: Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.// Sheldon: Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.// Penny: Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.// Leonard: Wow.// Penny: I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.// Leonard: No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.// Penny: Oh, that means so much. I love you.// Leonard: I love you, too.// Leonard: Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny.Series 10 Episode 08 – The Brain Bowl Incubation// Scene: Amy’s lab.// Sheldon: How much will it hurt?// Amy: It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.// Sheldon: On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.// Amy: A two.// Sheldon: Eating a whole Altoid?// Amy: Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to.// Sheldon: No, this is for science. I can be brave for science.// Amy: Thank you.// Sheldon: Oh, jiminy, that’s cold.// Amy: Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.// Sheldon: All right, just warn me before you do it.// Amy: Okay. Three, two, and we’re done.// Sheldon: You tricked me. You didn’t say one.// Amy: It didn’t hurt, did it?// Sheldon: No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…// Amy: Okay, fine, one.// Sheldon: Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The telescope room.// Raj: Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble.// Cleaner: Uh, sorry, I could come back.// Raj: Oh, no, it’s okay. I just found a wobble.// Cleaner: Oh, do I need a mop?// Raj: It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.// Cleaner: Oh, well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?// Raj: Yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce.// Cleaner: What is your name?// Raj; Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.// Cleaner: You think it would be more difficult than that?// Raj: Good point. And you are?// Cleaner: Oh, uh, Isabella Maria Concepcion.// Raj: Oh, well, nice to meet you.// Isabella: Nice to meet you, too. You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, working here was ten years old.// Raj: Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.// Isabella: Bueno, um, I’m just going to empty your waste paper basket and then I’ll get out of your way.// Raj: Oh, please, allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories.// Isabella: Thank you.// Raj: You’re welcome.// Isabella: Okay, uh, okay, I have to go.// Raj: Okay.// Isabella: Good luck with your, um, space exploration.// Raj: Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.// Sheldon: Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?// Amy: If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you.// Sheldon: Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful.// Amy: Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.// Sheldon: I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys.// Amy: These cells come from both of us.// Sheldon: Yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?// Amy: No reason we can’t start right now.// Sheldon: What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s// expose it to images of me and you and see who it likes better.// Amy: Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do.// Sheldon: I understand. She’s the mean one, I’m the fun one.// Scene: The apartment.// Howard: Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.// Raj: Oh, no, that’s mine.// Leonard: Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.// Raj: Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time.// Penny: You’re dating somebody, who is it?// Raj: What? What are you talking about?// Penny: You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.// Howard: No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage.// Raj: That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.// Penny: All right, fine, don’t tell us.// Raj: There’s nothing to tell.// Penny: All right.// Leonard: How’s that broccoli?// Raj: It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.// Penny: Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?// Raj: Isabella.// Howard: Oh, did you meet her at work?// Raj: Yes, in the telescope room.// Leonard: Oh, so she’s an astronomer?// Raj: Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good.// Penny: Well, that’s great, Raj. You must have so much in common.// Raj: Mm-hmm.// Howard: So, when do we meet her?// Raj: No, no, this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet.// Leonard: Okay, well, good luck with it.// Raj: Thank you.// Penny: How come you never eat broccoli?// Leonard: I’m married, I don’t have to be attractive.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: You know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years.// Bernadette: Still, I can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.// Amy: Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit.// Sheldon: Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.// Bernadette: Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you.// Sheldon: Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab.// Bernadette: I’m running out of ways to act excited.// Amy: So, enough about us, how are things going with you?// Bernadette: Great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now.// Amy: Good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked.// Sheldon: Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.// Bernadette: Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?// Sheldon: Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.// Bernadette: You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.// Sheldon: Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.// Bernadette: Mine has a fully developed immune system.// Sheldon: Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.// Amy: Sheldon, that’s enough.// Sheldon: Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.// Scene: A washroom at the university.// Raj: This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.// Isabella: You’re kidding.// Raj: No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.// Isabella: It’s okay, you’re allowed to have a cleaning lady.// Raj: Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair.// Isabella: I think that’s called a mommy.// Raj: Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?// Isabella: No, not for many years.// Raj: Oh, so, you are unencumbered?// Isabella: Just me and my son.// Raj: I love kids, how old is he?// Isabella: Nineteen.// Raj: That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.// Isabella: He’s studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.// Raj: That’s wonderful. A lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common.// Isabella: Yeah, I guess we do.// Raj: Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?// Isabella: Ay, Rajesh, I think you’re very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don’t have time for dating.// Raj: Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I’m very busy, too.// Isabella: Oh, please don’t take it personal, I think you’re a very nice man.// Raj: I think you’re very nice as well.// Isabella: Thank you for helping me. Good night, Rajesh.// Raj: Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us.// Isabella: Good night, Rajesh.// Raj: Okay. I’ll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I’ll be thinking of you.// Sheldon: Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it.// Amy: I’ve never seen results like this before.// Sheldon: Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge.// Amy: Aren’t you glad you participated in this?// Sheldon: Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?// Amy: Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.// Sheldon: Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.// Amy: Make a baby? What are you talking about?// Sheldon: Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!// Amy: Sheldon, I’m not ready to have a baby.// Sheldon: Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.// Amy: Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.// Sheldon: I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.// Amy: Not right now.// Sheldon: Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get.// Amy: I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today.// Sheldon: Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?// Raj: Welcome.// Isabella: What is this?// Raj: Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.// Isabella: Oh, Rajesh.// Raj: Oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while.// Isabella: Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you, you know I’m working.// Raj: That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.// Isabella: Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.// Raj: Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.// Isabella: Oh, really? You made Cuban food?// Raj: That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?// Scene: The stairwell.// Penny: Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?// Amy: No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.// Leonard: Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.// Penny: Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?// Amy: Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything.// Leonard: That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.// Penny: Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here.// Leonard: Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.// Amy: Hey, you’re talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man.// Penny: Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.// Leonard: Well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two.// Sheldon: Well, hello.// Amy: Hello.// Sheldon: Would you care for a brandy?// Amy: I don’t think so.// Sheldon: Good choice, it’s disgusting.// Amy: Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.// Sheldon: Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.// Amy: I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.// Sheldon: Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.// Amy: Okay, I’ve had enough.// Sheldon: Amy, come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters.// Raj: So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?// Isabella: Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah’s favourite things.// Raj: I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.// Isabella: You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you’d like to…// Howard: Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?// Raj: Uh.// Isabella: It’s okay. Uh, I should get back to work.// Howard: Hi. Howard Wolowitz.// Isabella: Oh. Isabella Concepcion.// Howard: Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper.// Isabella: You told him I was an astronomer?// Isabella: I understand. Time to go.// Raj: No, p-please don’t.// Isabella: It’s okay, Rajesh, I’m a grown woman. I don’t have to waste my time with someone who’s embarrassed by me.// Howard: I can keep this, right?// Raj: Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.// Isabella: If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?// Raj: I’m sorry. Honestly, I didn’t think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.// Isabella: I doubt that.// Raj: Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies.// Howard: Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart.// Raj: Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.// Isabella: You’re very persistent.// Raj: It’s my one move.// Isabella: Okay. This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.// Raj: Great. Where would you like to go?// Isabella: Your choice. It can be Pakistani food if you like.// Raj: Excuse me, but I’m Indian.// Isabella: And now you know how it feels.// Penny: So, were you turned on even a little bit?// Amy: It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.// Leonard: I’m sorry, is that a yes?// Amy: No.// Sheldon: Amy, I didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco.// Amy: For God’s sake, you’re ridiculous.// Sheldon: You guys are aroused, right?// Amy: That was a close one.Series 10 Episode 09 – The Geology Elevation// Scene: The cafeteria.// Bert: Thank you very much. Thanks.// Leonard: That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.// Howard: Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.// Raj: Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.// Sheldon: Everything is stupid and I want to go home.// Leonard: That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too.// Howard: Ah.// Sheldon: Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle.// Leonard: How much money did he win?// Raj: Over half a million dollars.// Leonard: Wow.// Howard: And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.// Sheldon: Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.// Howard: Here he comes.// Leonard: Right. Be polite.// Sheldon: I know how to behave.// Howard: Do you?// Raj: Hey, congratulations Bert.// Leonard: Yeah, good for you.// Howard: That’s amazing.// Bert: Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn’t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.// Sheldon: Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.// Bert: I’ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.// Sheldon: Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice.// Leonard: I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard.// Sheldon: Well, aren’t you a peach.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it.// Leonard: Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.// Penny: Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.// Sheldon: Who listens to the radio any more?// Amy: Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.// Leonard: They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.// Penny: You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?// Sheldon: You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.// Amy: You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning.// Sheldon: You want me to read a geology paper?// Amy: Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.// Bernadette: Who is it?// Howard: Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking.// Bernadette: Where did you get that?// Howard: I found him in an old box.// Bernadette: Why would you buy it?// Howard: I didn’t buy it. I made it.// Bernadette: Last question. What is wrong with you?// Howard: What’s the big deal?// Bernadette: Howie, it’s in poor taste.// Howard: No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff.// Remote-control Hawking: Hey good lookin’, want to go for a spin?// Howard: His eyes also light up in the dark.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.// Penny: It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.// Sheldon: Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why.// Amy: Sounds like the night we had coitus.// Sheldon: I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining.// Amy: Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit.// Sheldon: Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?// Penny: Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?// Leonard: What are you doing?// Penny: I, I knew the answer. I got excited.// Leonard: Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down.// Sheldon: That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.// Leonard: Hey, I’m trying to help you.// Sheldon: Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.// Leonard: You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…// Howard: Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it.// Raj: This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.// Howard: You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it.// Bernadette: Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.// Howard: I have no problem calling him.// Bernadette: Fine, then do it.// Howard: Fine, I will.// Bernadette: While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.// Raj: What’s this button do?// Remote-control Hawking: Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.// Howard: You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.// Raj: I laughed because the guy was Leonard.// Scene: The park.// Sheldon: I admire you, Leonard.// Leonard: Really, why?// Sheldon: You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.// Leonard: I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head.// Sheldon: How did you deal with it?// Leonard: I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix.// Sheldon: I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock.// Leonard: Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.// Sheldon: Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.// Leonard: Let it fly.// Sheldon: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…// Amy: What happened?// Sheldon: I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.// Leonard: Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.// Penny: Well, and what happened to you?// Leonard: Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine.// Amy: You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop.// Leonard: Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.// Amy: You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head.// Sheldon: Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you.// Amy: Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.// Leonard: You’re up.// Penny: This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.// Sheldon: Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?// Penny: I do, your life is fine you big baby.// Sheldon: Maybe you’re right.// Amy: Really?// Leonard: If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too.// Sheldon: Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure.// Penny: There you go.// Sheldon: And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.// Scene: Outside Amy’s lab. Howard knocks on the door.// Amy: What’s up?// Howard: I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?// Amy: Yep.// Howard: Do you think this is in poor taste?// Leonard: Does it spin around and do tricks?// Howard: Yeah// Leonard: Then yeah.// Scene: Barry Kripke’s office.// Howard: What do you think?// Barry: That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom.// Howard: All right, we’re done. It’s offensive.// Sheldon: Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.// Howard: You’re in a good mood.// Sheldon: Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.// Leonard: Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?// Raj: Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward.// Sheldon: Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.// Howard: What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?// Leonard: I think he might be learning on his own.// Raj: Then the robot uprising has begun.// Sheldon: Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.// Raj: He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.// Sheldon: Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.// Bert: Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great.// Sheldon: Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.// Bert: You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year.// Sheldon: Really? I didn’t know that.// Bert: So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?// Sheldon: You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me. (Off) Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.// (Off)// Leonard: Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.// Amy: I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.// Sheldon: No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.// Bernadette: I can’t imagine you being violent.// Leonard: It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.// Sheldon: I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.// Raj: It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.// Amy: What about me and Sheldon?// Raj: Sure.// Leonard: I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.// Raj: Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.// Amy: Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks.// Penny: Aw, thank you.// Amy: That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.// Penny: What?// Amy: You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.// Penny: You liked my short hair, right?// Leonard: Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.// Penny: Seriously, none of you liked it?// Bernadette: I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?// Penny: You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?// Bernadette: I think he looks cute.// Howard: And I think you’re cute.// Raj: I think you’re both cute.// Penny: I think I hate all of you nerds.// Scene: A corridor at the university.// Sheldon: Sorry I’m moving slowly.// Leonard: Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma.// Sheldon: Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.// Leonard: Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.// Sheldon: I can’t take this any more. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert.// (Knock, knock, knock)// Bert: Come in.// Sheldon: All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk.// Bert: What happened to you?// Sheldon: Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.// Bert: Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for.// Sheldon: I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened.// Bert: Is it working?// Sheldon: No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.// Bert: Well, you know, we’re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.// Sheldon: We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go.// Bert: Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?// Sheldon: You know what? This isn’t gonna work.// Bert: Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.// Sheldon: Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?// Bert: It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better.// Penny: I can’t believe you punched Bert.// Sheldon: I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it.// Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better.// Stephen Hawking (on skype): Hello, Sheldon.// (on skype)// Sheldon: Professor Hawking.// Hawking: I understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy.// Sheldon: Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool.// Hawking: Don’t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.// Penny: Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair.// Hawking: It’s fine. I’ve been on The Simpsons.// Sheldon: How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?// Hawking: I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.// Leonard: Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care.// Hawking: Don’t waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you’re too brilliant.// Amy: How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?// Sheldon: I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.// Hawking: I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.// Sheldon: What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?// Leonard: Do not tell Wolowitz.// Amy: Way ahead of you.// Scene: The Ellen Show.// Ellen: A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that’s true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they’re dumb.// Sheldon: Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful.Series 10 Episode 10 – The Property Division Collision// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?// Sheldon: Oh, actually, I would.// Amy: Great, what’d you have in mind?// Sheldon: Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.// Amy: Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.// Sheldon: You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.// Amy: Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.// Sheldon: You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.// Amy: Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody.// Sheldon: It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.// Amy: It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.// Sheldon: Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.// Amy: I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.// Scene: At the apartment door.// Sheldon: Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.// Penny: Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.// Sheldon: What happened to them?// Penny: Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.// Leonard: Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool.// Penny: Amy wants me to have it.// Amy: Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.// Penny: But it’s a picture of you.// Amy: And you.// Penny: But you commissioned it.// Amy: To give to you.// Penny: But you like it so much.// Amy: So do you.// Penny: I seem to be losing.// Leonard: Yes, you do.// Sheldon: You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?// Penny: Why don’t you keep it?// Sheldon: That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.// Penny: Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with.// Sheldon: Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?// Leonard: Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.// Sheldon: Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.// Leonard: Fine, take the plant.// Sheldon: Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Bernadette: Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift.// Stuart: Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you’re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond.// Bernadette: A foot massage?// Stuart: And that’s not me being creepy, that’s for either of you.// Howard: This is very nice Stuart, thank you.// Bernadette: How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?// Stuart: Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?// Bernadette: Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby.// Stuart: Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get.// Bernadette: Thank you, but I’m not really sure.// Howard: Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.// Stuart: That woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.// Bernadette: I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.// Stuart: Thank you. And it’s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.// Howard: When would you move in?// Stuart: Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I’m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I’m gonna go vacuum.// Bernadette: Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.// Stuart: Okay, then I’ll dust.// Bernadette: I did that, too.// Stuart: Then I’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.// Bernadette: Howard just did that.// Howard: Yeah, let him do it.// Sheldon: Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?// Leonard: Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.// Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock: Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.// Sheldon: It’s one of a kind.// Penny: So if it breaks there’d be none of it?// Sheldon: Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.// Leonard: So you think you should keep it?// Sheldon: I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.// Leonard: Keep the clock, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Penny: Thank you.// Amy: Thank you?// Sheldon: Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?// Leonard: Let me guess, you want it.// Sheldon: Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.// Leonard: You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care.// Sheldon: Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.// Leonard: Well, now they’re yours.// Penny: Leonard.// Leonard: Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.// Sheldon: For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?// Amy: Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?// Sheldon: It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.// Leonard: You know what? There is one thing I would like.// Sheldon: Yeah, take whatever you want.// Leonard: I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.// Sheldon: But you don’t even like flags.// Leonard: Yeah, I like this one.// Sheldon: But I designed it.// Leonard: But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.// Sheldon: But you don’t even understand its symbolism.// Leonard: Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it.// Sheldon: Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted.// Amy: I don’t think you do, but all right.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.// Bernadette: Stuart, you cooked?// Howard: How did you know it wasn’t me?// Bernadette: There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess.// Howard (door bell rings): That’s Raj.// (door bell rings)// Stuart: You guys relax, I’ll get it. Have some bread while it’s still warm.// Howard: It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne.// Bernadette: You have a Batsuit.// Howard: It’s pajamas, there’s no cape.// Stuart: Hey, Raj.// Raj: Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?// Stuart: Oh, I’m living here again.// Raj: Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?// Stuart: No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.// Raj: Okay, cool.// Stuart: Anyway, come on in, dinner’s ready.// Raj: Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.// Stuart: Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.// Leonard: Is the Wi-Fi working for you?// Penny: Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.// Leonard: Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.// Penny: Are you sure?// Leonard: Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.// Penny: What a jerk.// Leonard: You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?// Penny: Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that.// Leonard: Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.// Sheldon: Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter.// Leonard: Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too.// Sheldon: If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.// Leonard: All right, I tried.// Sheldon: All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.// Amy: I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?// Sheldon: It’s a good thing you’re cute.// Raj: So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.// Bernadette: Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that.// Stuart: Oh, I know a CPR instructor who’ll come to the house.// Howard: That’d be great.// Stuart: I’ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.// Bernadette: Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.// Stuart: You just kick back and relax, I’ve got it all under control.// Raj: Although it was already under control.// Stuart: I’m sorry, you mumbled something?// Raj: It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.// Stuart: Well, you know what they say, it takes a village.// Raj: Well, they already had a village.// Stuart: I noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together.// Raj: Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.// Stuart: You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We’ll pass, thank you.// Bernadette: Do something, Batman.// Scene: The laundry room.// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: What do you think you’re doing?// Leonard: Separating my delicates.// Sheldon: This is the level you’re stooping to.// Leonard: No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.// Scene: Howard and Bernadett’s house.// Stuart: Hey, what’s up?// Raj: I’m here to put the crib together.// Stuart: Ooh, sorry, I already did it.// Raj: Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.// Stuart: Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com// Raj: Why are you being like this?// Stuart: Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.// Raj: Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.// Stuart: Why can’t there be four wheels?// Raj: Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?// Stuart: Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.// Raj: Thank you.// Stuart: If you’re hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it.// Scene: The stairwell.// Penny: I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?// Leonard: No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?// Strange old man: Hey, how you doing?// Leonard: Uh, can I help you?// Strange old man: I don’t think so, but you’re sweet for asking.// Penny: What, what are you doing in our apartment?// Strange old man: Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.// Leonard: Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here.// Sheldon: So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.// Leonard: Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?// Sheldon: My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.// Theodore: It’s like the ’40s again.// Sheldon: Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.// Penny: All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.// Sheldon: That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID.// Theodore: Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I’m O-negative.// Sheldon: And now you know as much about him as I do.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s living room.// Raj: Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?// Bernadette: Great, go with the giraffes.// Stuart: Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.// Bernadette: Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras.// Stuart: Good choice, boss.// Raj: At least my nose is naturally brown.// Bernadette: Hey, could you please go to the market for me?// Howard: Get Stuart or Raj to do it.// Bernadette: Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you.// Howard: Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them.// Bernadette: Please just go to the store.// Howard: Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?// Raj (off): Me// (off)// Stuart (off): I’ll do it.// Bernadette: Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.// Penny: What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?// Leonard: And just leave him here alone?// Penny: Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive.// Leonard: Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?// Theodore: Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.// Leonard: This is ridiculous.// Theodore: I like the painting. Is that your mom?// Leonard: Sheldon, get out here.// Sheldon: Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?// Leonard: We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?// Sheldon: I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.// Leonard: Because you were being selfish.// Sheldon: Dividing our belongings is difficult.// Leonard: Why? I said I didn’t care.// Theodore: Excuse me. It’s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.// Leonard: Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.// Theodore: Well, I’m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.// Amy: I think he might be right. Also, who is that?// Sheldon: I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.// Leonard: Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone.// Theodore: If you’re looking for a new guy to live with.// Leonard: No.// Penny: We’re good, thank you.// Amy: So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay.// Sheldon: Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.// Leonard: Well, I’d like that, too.// Sheldon: In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals.// Leonard: You promise?// Sheldon: I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.// Theodore: Well if we’re rubbing genitals on things, that’s where I shine.// Penny: Little lower to the left. A little more.// Leonard: Good?// Penny: No, still hideous.// Leonard: Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there.// Penny: Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.// Theodore: I think it brings the room together.// Howard: Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?// Raj: I’ll do it.// Stuart: Why do you get to do it? I’m the artist.// Raj: Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.// Stuart: Just because I look sickly doesn’t mean I’m starving.// Bernadette (off): Howard!// Howard: Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.// Bernadette: I think I’m in labour.// Howard: Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan.// Stuart: I’ll get the hospital bag.// Raj: I’ll pull the van up.// Stuart: Meet you outside in 2 minutes.// Raj: Team Baby, go.// Howard: I love you.// Bernadette: I love you, too.// Stuart: Are we hugging or having a baby? Let’s go.Series 10 Episode 11 – The Birthday Synchronicity// After a “previously on” sequence…// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s van.// Howard: Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin’ okay?// Bernadette: Here comes another contraction.// Stuart: Let’s pick it up.// Raj: All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs.// Howard: Stop that, this isn’t India.// Raj: Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?// Howard: Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.// Raj: I love you, too. We’re good.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.// Sheldon: Amy? Wake up.// Amy: What’s wrong?// Sheldon: It’s midnight. Happy birthday.// Amy: Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.// Sheldon: This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.// Amy: I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?// Sheldon: A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.// Amy: I love it. Thank you.// Sheldon: And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.// Amy: Is that okay?// Sheldon: I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.// Amy: You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.// Penny (off): Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby.// (off)// Leonard (off): Come on, we’re going to the hospital.// Amy: I guess, I guess we should stop.// Sheldon: Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.// Scene: A delivery room.// Midwife: Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?// Howard: I’m the father.// Midwife: Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?// Howard: No idea. Ask him.// Raj: 12 minutes.// Midwife: 12 minutes? Why are you here?// Stuart: Aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?// Midwife: This is a hospital, not the airport.// Bernadette: I’m sorry. It’s our first time.// Midwife: It’s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we’re having?// Howard: No, we’re keeping it a surprise.// Midwife: Old school. Nice.// Bernadette: Not that old school. He knows.// Raj: You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.// Howard: And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.// Midwife: Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.// Raj: I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?// Midwife: I’m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.// Scene: The stairwell.// Penny: Sheldon, what took you so long?// Sheldon: Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.// Leonard: Damn, I need my inhaler.// Amy: Just don’t smoke.// Leonard: No, I went down the stairs too fast.// Penny (answering phone): Hey.// (answering phone)// Raj: Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.// Penny: Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?// Bernadette: We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.// Penny: Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while.// Amy: Well, first deliveries can be slow.// Sheldon: I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.// Leonard: I found it, but it’s empty.// Penny: Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now.// Leonard: Are you sure? I’d really like to.// Amy: Well, should we, uh, head back up?// Penny: Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?// Amy: Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?// Sheldon: It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide.// Penny: Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun.// Amy: Uh.// Penny: We could go to a bar.// Amy: Well.// Leonard: Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.// Penny: Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!// Sheldon: That’s a bit childish, isn’t it?// Penny: I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?// Sheldon: Grape. I find it the most mild.// Penny: All right, well, you two go have fun.// Leonard: If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.// Penny: Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Bernadette: Do you really need to record this?// Raj: You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t.// Howard: All right, enough with the camera.// Raj: Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.// Howard: I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?// Raj: I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!// Stuart: You’re doing great.// Bernadette: Raj.// Raj: Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.// Bernadette: How could you?// Howard: We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it.// Raj: Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.// Stuart: You told me it was a girl, and I didn’t say it.// Raj: You were supposed to keep that to yourself.// Stuart: Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.// Amy: So, where were we?// Sheldon: Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.// Amy: I’m sorry.// Sheldon: Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.// Amy: Well, shall we start over?// Sheldon: Very well.// Sheldon: I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.// Amy: Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush.// Sheldon: Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them.// Amy: And the mood continues to change.// Sheldon: No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this.// Amy: Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.// Sheldon: Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?// Amy: No.// Sheldon: Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…// Amy: It’s not about trains.// Sheldon: Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?// Amy: Stop talking about trains.// Sheldon: Who’s killing the mood now?// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?// Penny: Well, I didn’t until I heard that.// Leonard: Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.// Raj (off): Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again.// Penny: Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away.// Raj: You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.// Sheldon: Can I look yet?// Amy: One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter.// Sheldon: Wowza.// Amy: I got a Gryffindor robe for you.// Sheldon: What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.// Amy: I did. Am I in trouble?// Sheldon: Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.// Amy: Wait, what just happened?// Sheldon: You know I’ve been wanting to go.// Amy: Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?// Sheldon: Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry.// Amy: Ooh. Happy birthday to me.// Raj (off): Hello.// Amy: Is this about the baby?// Raj: No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.// Amy: Good. Then you’re used to this.// Penny: Hey, Bernadette’s water broke.// Leonard: Come on, everyone to the hospital.// Amy: You have got to be kidding me.// Howard: Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little.// Stuart: I’m not an old man, I just can’t see at night.// Bernadette: Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right.// Stuart: All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call ’em out.// Scene: Leonard’s car.// Penny: Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?// Amy: :21,369 –> 00:12:23,536// Yeah, but I thought this// baby was supposed to ruin their sex life, not mine.// Raj: This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.// Leonard: Well, it is their child.// Raj: I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.// Sheldon: Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.// Raj: And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.// Amy: I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?// Sheldon: She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.// Scene: The delivery suite.// Howard: Deep breaths, slow breaths.// Bernadette: I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.// Stuart: Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I’ll go get some more.// Howard: Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back.// Stuart: Okay.// Howard: So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.// Bernadette: We could name her after your mom.// Howard: Debbie? No. She hated that name.// Bernadette: Did she have a middle name?// Howard: Melvina.// Bernadette: Let’s keep thinking.// Howard: Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.// Bernadette: I know.// Howard: Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma.// Bernadette: She did always have candy in her pocket.// Howard: Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.// Bernadette: I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?// Howard: Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today.// Scene: The waiting room.// Leonard: It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.// Amy: Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie.// Penny: How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?// Leonard: It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come.// Stuart: Hmm. You two got married.// Amy: Sheldon and I are living together.// Sheldon: But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.// Leonard: Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep.// Penny: Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.// Stuart: Howard went to space.// Amy: Bernadette got her doctorate.// Leonard: Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.// Amy: We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of.// Raj: For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you.// Stuart: What’s your problem?// Raj: Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.// Sheldon: I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.// Stuart: Raj, if it’s any consolation, I’m no better off than I was ten years ago.// Raj: Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.// Sheldon: Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say.// Raj: Excuse me.// Leonard: Sorry, Stuart.// Stuart: Hey, I’m in a hospital and I’m not the patient. I’m fine.// Howard: Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class.// Bernadette: I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.// Howard: Do you want me to get the nurse?// Bernadette: No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off.// Leonard: I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.// Sheldon: Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted.// Raj: Hey.// Stuart: Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?// Penny: You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room.// Raj: Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move.// Penny: Anyone else want to try?// Stuart: Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?// Penny: Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.// Raj: I bought the first one, it didn’t fall.// Penny: Here.// Howard: She’s here, the baby’s here.// Penny: Oh!// Raj: Congratulations.// Amy: How’s Bernadette?// Howard: Tired, but great. They’re both great.// Penny: Does the baby have a name yet?// Howard: We have named her Halley.// Penny: – Oh.// Leonard: Oh, like Halley’s comet.// Howard: Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.// Amy: That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking.// Howard: I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.// Raj: Really?// Howard: Of course.// Raj: You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.// Scene: The hospital nursery.// Penny: Oh, look at all the babies.// Sheldon: Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about.// Leonard; I wonder which one’s Halley.// Amy: Kind of hard to see the names.// Penny: Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.// Amy: They all look the same to me.// Raj: Guys, she’s my goddaughter, I think I’ll know when I see her. That one.// Amy: Well, that was quite a day.// Sheldon: It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.// Amy: I was afraid you’d be too tired.// Sheldon: Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay, I don’t know what is.Series 10 Episode 12 – The Holiday Summation// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?// Leonard: Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.// Penny: Yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore.// Leonard: Well, he doesn’t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.// Penny (checking phone): Oh. It’s Bernadette. She says they’re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.// (checking phone)// Leonard: Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win.// Sheldon: Hello.// Amy: Hi.// Penny: Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?// Sheldon: Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.// Amy: It was not a great trip.// Penny: Well, you’re home now.// Sheldon: Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?// Penny: I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.// Credits sequence.// Leonard: Did you at least have a good flight down there?// Sheldon: It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.// Penny: So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?// Leonard: And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.// Sheldon: Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…// Flashback.// Sheldon: How did we get in the car?// Back to apartment.// Leonard: Hold on. How did you get him in the car?// Amy: I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.// Amy: So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together.// Sheldon: Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.// Amy: Maybe there won’t be one.// Sheldon: There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.// Amy: Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it.// Sheldon: Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.// Penny: Do boys have flowers?// Leonard: Who knows what he has down there.// Penny: Mm.// Sheldon: Anyway…// Mary: Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.// Sheldon: Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?// Mary: You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you’re in a church with a guitar.// Amy: Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.// Mary: Oh, it’s my pleasure. Mm. I’m so glad y’all could make it. So, tell me, what’s going on back home?// Amy: Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.// Mary: Oh, that’s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?// Sheldon: Welcome to Texas.// Amy: They haven’t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.// Sheldon: Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.// Mary: Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.// Sheldon: All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not.// Mary: Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.// Sheldon: What? Wh, where’s the judgment? Wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there.// Mary: Obviously, I would prefer if you weren’t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I’m very happy for you.// Sheldon: And what special circumstances are those?// Penny: Oh, boy, I think it’s about to get bad.// Mary: Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.// Sheldon: What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?// Mary: No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there’d be nurses.// Sheldon: Well, this is highly insulting.// Amy: Sheldon, don’t overreact.// Sheldon: I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.// Amy: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.// Mary: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.// Penny: What?// Sheldon: Well, I was in my room, I couldn’t hear what they were saying.// Amy: I’ll take over from here.// Amy: He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?// Mary: He’s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.// Amy: Are you going to?// Mary: Oh, heck no.// Amy: Sheldon, what, what are you doing?// Sheldon: Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.// Mary: You startin’ to see why I didn’t go in there? Sheldon, if you’re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain’t changing my mind.// Amy: We’re ignoring the fins, okay.// Sheldon: Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too.// Amy: I don’t think that’s what she’s saying.// Sheldon: And?// Amy: That’s exactly what she was saying.// Sheldon: Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?// Leonard: Absolutely not.// Penny: That’s too loud.// Amy: Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.// Sheldon: Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.// Amy: You know, I’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone.// Sheldon: You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard’s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…// Amy: What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?// Sheldon: I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.// Amy: Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.// Sheldon: I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.// Amy: She was gonna find out eventually.// Sheldon: Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me.// Amy: Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.// Sheldon: Why would you do that?// Amy: This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.// Sheldon: You managed the situation?// Amy: That’s right.// Sheldon: So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life.// Amy: Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you.// Sheldon: I have gotten much better at that.// Amy: Have you? How am I feeling right now?// Sheldon: What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.// Amy: You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.// Sheldon: How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?// Amy: Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?// Sheldon: Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.// Bernadette: Hi.// Howard: Hey, guys.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: Hi. There’s the little family!// Raj: Hello.// Stuart: Hello.// Leonard: And their Sherpas.// Howard: The baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?// Penny: Yeah. Go ahead.// Amy: Do you need help?// Howard: No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.// Bernadette: Sorry we’re late.// Penny: Oh, it’s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.// Sheldon: Yeah. Here. I’ll catch you up.// Penny: Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head.// Leonard: On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.// Sheldon: I was acting odd intentionally.// Bernadette: Really? So you can control it?// Penny: Okay. Then what happened?// Sheldon: Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) My mother made me take it out. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) Amy put alcohol on it. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) And here we are.// (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.)// Howard: What did we miss?// Bernadette: I couldn’t explain it if I tried.// Scene: The same, later.// Penny: So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?// Amy: Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.// Howard: So what did you and Leonard do?// Penny: Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.// Leonard: It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.// Raj: Oh, my God, what happened?// Leonard: Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me.// Bernadette: It’s like I was excited for a present and got socks.// Stuart: I don’t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.// Sheldon: I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.// Penny: To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.// Howard: What happened// Penny: You do make a cute elf.// Leonard: Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.// Penny: Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.// Leonard: Oh cool, I’ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.// Time lapse.// Leonard: Stupid idea.// Penny: No, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go.// Leonard: For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!// Penny: Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens.// Leonard: You know how easily I blister.// Penny: Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit.// Leonard: Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.// Penny: Fine.// Leonard: Thank you.// Penny: Leonard?// Leonard: Yeah.// Penny: There’s something on the windshield.// Flash forward to the stairwell.// Penny: You need a break?// Leonard: Do not need a break.// Penny: There’s no shame in asking for a break.// Leonard: If I need a break, I’ll ask for a break.// Flash forward.// Penny: Ugh. Leonard?// Leonard: Yeah?// Penny: There’s a tree on you.// Leonard: You want to decorate it tonight?// Penny: Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.// Leonard (hearing animal noises): I hope it kills us both.// (hearing animal noises)// Leonard: By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.// Sheldon: So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?// Bernadette: Sure.// Sheldon: Hey, how’s life with your baby?// Amy: Really? You’re never gonna touch their baby?// Sheldon: To this day I’ve never touched Stuart.// Bernadette: It’s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.// Bernadette: Oh, please stop crying, I’m begging you. I don’t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. Shh. What have we done?// Howard: Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies.// Bernadette: It took me two hours to get her down.// Raj: You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always, sometimes we’d leave.// Howard: Hey, he got her to stop.// Bernadette: That was so fast.// Raj: Oh, he’s really good with her.// Bernadette: Yeah, he has a gift.// Howard: What’s the matter?// Bernadette: Nothing, these are happy tears.// Howard: Oh, good.// Bernadette: No they’re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can’t?// Howard: I mean, it’s Stuart. Maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away.// Bernadette: Not funny.// Raj: She’s tired, that was funny.// Bernadette: Everyone’s a better mom than me.// Raj: Oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk.// Sheldon: Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?// Leonard: Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?// Stuart: Oh, I just talked to her. I’ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.// Penny: You poor things you must be exhausted.// Howard: It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.// Bernadette: How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.// Howard: She doesn’t hate you, stop saying that.// Bernadette: Now you hate me too.// Howard: Shh, I don’t hate you.// Sheldon: It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.// Bernadette: Thank you, Sheldon, I’m feeling better now.// Sheldon: Thank you, Internet. I’m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.// Penny: So things started to turn around?// Bernadette: Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.// Leonard: Please tell me you didn’t use Amy’s magic juice.// Howard: Bernie?// Bernadette: Shh. She’s asleep.// Howard: Great. And where are you?// Bernadette: Down here.// Howard: Oh. This is new.// Bernadette: I didn’t know what else to do. It worked.// Howard: Well, I’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on.// Bernadette: Don’t make me laugh.// Howard: Do you need help getting out?// Bernadette: I think I live here now. It’s fine.// Howard: Is it okay if I get some sleep?// Bernadette: Yeah, go ahead.// Howard: Good job, Mommy. I’m proud of you.// Bernadette: Don’t make me cry, either.// Howard: Good night. I love both my girls.// Bernadette: We love you, too.// Penny: I can’t believe you fit in the crib.// Bernadette: I could take a bath in the sink. I don’t, but I can.// Raj: So how were your holidays?// Stuart: Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She’s in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go… oh come on.// Amy: That was fun, thank you.// Bernadette: Yeah, thanks.// Penny: Our pleasure.// Leonard: See you guys at work.// Raj: Be there bright and early.// Howard: Not me, paternity leave.// Sheldon: Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.// Howard: With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this.Series 10 Episode 13 – The Romance Recalibration// After a previously on sequence.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: What, what’s all this?// Leonard: Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.// Penny: Oh, that is so thoughtful.// Leonard: Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?// Penny: Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it.// Leonard: and this wine is why.// Penny: Oh. Hey, what smells so good?// Leonard: I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.// Penny: Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.// Leonard: Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself.// Penny: Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this.// Leonard: Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep.// Penny: You did not just quote an Nsync song.// Leonard: I quoted your favourite Nsync song.// Penny: Oh.// Out of daydream sequence.// Leonard: Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: Leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?// Leonard: Why?// Sheldon: I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.// Leonard: That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.// Sheldon: That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?// Leonard: Are you gonna laugh at the answer?// Sheldon: Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.// Leonard: If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me.// Sheldon: Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall.// Leonard: So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night.// Sheldon: At our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?// Leonard: Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?// that// Penny: I hadn’t really thought about it.// Amy: But now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.// Bernadette: Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?// Amy: Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him.// Bernadette: I’ve been seeing him for years, I’m still not convinced he’s real.// Penny: Hey, can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?// Bernadette: Uh oh, what’s going on?// Penny: Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.// Bernadette: It’s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now.// Amy: Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.// Penny: Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more.// Amy: Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: All right, got Halley to sleep.// Raj: Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.// Howard: Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room.// Raj: Have you tried anything to fix it?// Howard: Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help.// Raj: I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?// Howard: Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.// Raj: Did that do anything?// Howard: Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug.// Sheldon: If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move.// Leonard: Oh, no. Good game.// Penny: Hey.// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?// Penny: Oh, it was fine.// Sheldon: Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?// Penny: Uh, chips.// Sheldon: Anything to drink?// Penny: Some wine.// Sheldon: Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here.// Leonard: Just ignore him.// Penny: Hm. At least he took an interest.// Leonard: What’s that supposed to mean?// Penny: Nothing.// Leonard: Hey, what’s going on with you?// Penny: I don’t want to talk about it.// Leonard: Well, hey, come on, just tell me.// Penny: Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.// Leonard: What? Where is this coming from?// Sheldon: Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.// Penny: It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more.// Leonard: That is ridiculous.// Penny: This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.// Leonard: No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?// Penny: Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.// Leonard: Fine, go ahead.// Sheldon: Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.// Bernadette (on phone): Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.// Bernadette (on phone):// Howard: That sounds expensive.// Raj: Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.// Howard: MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.// Raj: Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?// Howard: No.// Raj: Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?// Bernadette: I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?// Howard: Is that supposed to be funny?// Raj: Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny.// Penny: All right, we’re heading out.// Leonard: Mm-hmm.// Amy: I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.// Sheldon: And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?// Amy: I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.// Leonard: Have fun.// Penny: Thanks. Are you ready?// Amy: Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.// Sheldon: You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.// Leonard: Go ahead, it’s fine.// Sheldon: Bye.// Amy: Bye.// Leonard: Okay.// Penny: Let’s go.// Amy: I’ll miss you.// Sheldon: Yeah, I’ll miss you too.// Amy: I’ll miss you more.// Sheldon: Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one.// Amy: If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…// Leonard: Thank you.// Scene: The apartment, later.// Sheldon: Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea.// Leonard: Thanks.// Sheldon: And it’s just the way you like it.// Leonard: Earl grey?// Sheldon: Yes.// Leonard: Honey?// Leonard: Unsweetened almond…// Sheldon: Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.// Leonard: Sorry, thank you.// Sheldon: Well, what can we do to cheer you up?// Leonard: I really don’t know.// Sheldon: You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?// Leonard: I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in.// Leonard: Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.// Sheldon: Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.// Howard: Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib.// Raj: It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.// Howard: Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.// Raj: Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.// Howard: Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it.// Raj: It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.// Howard: Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.// Raj: Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?// Howard: It’s a tradition of my people. (Singing) If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.// (Singing)// Raj: Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.// Scene: Leonards car.// Sheldon: Would you like to play a driving game I invented?// Leonard: Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?// Sheldon: Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?// Leonard: I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.// Sheldon: Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different.// Leonard: I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got.// Scene: The spa.// Penny: When was the last time you got a massage?// Amy: Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.// Penny: Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.// Amy: I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?// Penny: Well, yeah.// Amy: Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.// Penny: What are you doing here?// Leonard: I came here to apologize.// Penny: Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself.// Leonard: Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.// Sheldon: Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you.// Amy: Nice to see you, too.// Sheldon: And that’s how you make effort look effortless.// Penny: All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?// Leonard: I don’t understand what you want.// Penny: I’m trying to figure it out.// Sheldon: You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.// Amy: Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?// Sheldon: Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.// Howard: So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,// once you get the hang of it. Step. Step. Hop onto Ottoman.// Raj: Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.// Howard: Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.// Bernadette: You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.// Raj: Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed.// Howard: Bigger problems, I felt something pop.// Sheldon: There’s a cucumber in my water.// Amy: Uh-huh.// Sheldon: Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?// Amy: It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.// Sheldon: Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh.// Sheldon: Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?// Penny: We’re not getting divorced.// Leonard: Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple.// Penny: Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um.// Leonard: Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule.// Penny: Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.// Leonard: What do you say?// Sheldon: I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started.// Penny (after Amy laughs): Do you really think that’s funny?// (after Amy laughs)// Amy: It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.// Sheldon: If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.// Penny: Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.// Leonard: Does it really need to say that?// Sheldon: I did this for free, let me get a little something.// Leonard: Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it.// Penny: I think this all looks good.// Leonard: Me, too.// Sheldon: Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition.// Amy: I remember signing our first relationship agreement.// Sheldon: Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.// Amy: Right, right. Got it.Series 10 Episode 14 – The Emotion Detection Automation// Scene: The stairwell.// Leonard: What’s going on with that woman you’re dating?// Raj: I broke up with her.// Leonard: Why?// Raj: She said she didn’t want to see me any more and I found that insulting.// Howard: I thought things were going well. What happened?// Raj: I don’t know, she didn’t even give me a reason.// Sheldon: That’s not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?// Raj: Can we not play this game?// Sheldon: Doesn’t like games. That’s one.// Leonard: Ignore him. Yeah, sorry about the breakup.// Raj: That’s okay, I’m fine.// Sheldon: Of course you’re fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made.// Raj: I’m not a virgin, Sheldon.// Sheldon: So now you think you’re better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women don’t like you.// Leonard: You’re not being very nice.// Sheldon: What? He said he was fine.// Howard: Sometimes people say things they don’t mean.// Sheldon: Oh, that’s a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said.// Leonard: Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey.// Penny: Hey, boys. How’s it going?// Sheldon: Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive.// Bernadette: So, normal.// Sheldon: Yeah.// Amy: Sheldon, what did you do?// Sheldon: We were discussing Raj’s recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him.// Raj: It’s okay, I’m fine.// Sheldon: Don’t fall for it. He’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy.// Raj: Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn’t want to talk about it any more.// Sheldon: Then why didn’t you say that?// Howard: Because that’s not what people do.// Sheldon: Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.// Penny: No. No, you don’t, you really don’t. I actually can’t say don’t enough.// Sheldon: Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues.// Amy: I’m sure it’s extremely frustrating.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Amy: And also a little sad.// Sheldon: Okay, now you’re just showing off.// Bernadette: You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions.// Leonard: And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.// Bernadette: It’s supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time.// Penny: Wow, I find that hard to believe.// Leonard: That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?// Penny: I take it back. I believe it.// Howard: You if it’s at MIT, I can make some calls. Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype.// Amy: What do you think?// Sheldon: A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.// Bernadette: Wouldn’t that be nice.// Sheldon: It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them.// Bernadette: I like the first one.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The comic book store.// Raj: Now that Sheldon’s across the hall, have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?// Leonard: I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.// Sheldon: You could make it a train room.// Leonard: I don’t like trains. You like trains.// Sheldon: I know, and Amy says I can’t have a train room.// Howard: Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader. They’re sending a prototype for you to beta test.// Sheldon: Wonderful. Although I’m not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.// Leonard: Well, when you get the machine, you can find out.// Raj: Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.// Howard: Well, you don’t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize.// Raj: That’s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what’s wrong with me.// Leonard: No, Raj, that’s a terrible idea.// Howard: Yeah, I was joking.// Sheldon: Really? Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work.// Penny: Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother’s coming out here in a few weeks.// Leonard: Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What’s going on with your brother?// Penny: My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.// Leonard: Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?// Penny: Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs.// Leonard: Well, I’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he’ll stay?// Penny: I, I’m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?// Leonard: Hmm. Who knows? That’s exciting. I’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.// Penny: You don’t have a problem with this, do you?// Leonard: Of course not. I mean, he’s your brother.// Penny: Okay. Thank you, you’re the best. Mm.// Leonard: Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.// Scene: Sheldon’s office.// Howard: This thing’s pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.// Amy: It’s amazing a machine can do that.// Sheldon: Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, they’ll know that I’ve been rooting for them the whole time.// Howard: The display is synced to your phone. Give it a try.// Amy: All right. Now, I’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately.// Howard: Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things you’re feeling, like, what have I done with my life?// Amy: Okay, I’m looking at the first picture.// Sheldon: You are happy?// Amy: Yes. I’m looking at puppi// Sheldon: Aw. Somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right.// Howard: Try another one.// Amy: Okay. What does it say I’m feeling?// Sheldon: Sad.// Amy: Yes. I’m looking at a picture of my grandma.// Sheldon: Oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her.// Amy: Yes.// Sheldon: And you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you’re mad. Make up your mind.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Raj (on phone): Okay, Emily. Yeah, sounds great. See you then.// (on phone)// Bernadette: Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?// Raj: Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.// Howard: Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?// Raj: We are going to find out.// Bernadette: Why would you do that, Raj?// Raj: Well, I want information in order to improve myself.// Bernadette: You’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings.// Raj: Don’t worry, I’m a grown man. I have a thick skin.// Howard: You’re so stupid.// Raj: Hey.// Penny: Hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? I’m trying to help him clean it up a little.// Leonard: Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?// Penny: He didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah.// Sheldon: Hey, Leonard, if you’re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector.// Leonard: How’s it working out?// Sheldon: Surprisingly well.// Leonard: That’s great, I’m happy for you.// Sheldon: No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Aren’t you sweet?// Amy: What’s that? Are you working on your resume?// Penny: No, it’s my brother’s. I’m trying to help him get a job out here.// Sheldon: Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.// Leonard: No, it doesn’t.// Sheldon: What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. It’s this red frowny guy on my phone.// Penny: What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Yes.// Leonard: I said no.// Sheldon: It’s like you’re twins.// Penny: Leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me.// Leonard: Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.// Penny: He’s my brother. I didn’t think I needed your permission.// Sheldon: Well, hey. Now she’s angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters.// Leonard: I’m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay.// Penny: Like you talked to me about your gaming room?// Leonard: Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.// Sheldon: He’s still mad.// Amy: Stop enjoying their fight.// Sheldon: You first.// Penny: If you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when I told you?// Leonard: Because I didn’t want to sound like a jerk.// Penny: Well, you sound like one now. I don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while.// Leonard: If you get him a job, he’s gonna live here forever!// Penny: He would get his own place.// Leonard: Has he ever had his own place?// Penny: Yes.// Leonard: Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?// Penny: It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?// Sheldon: Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.// Penny: You gave me a bill at the end of every month.// Leonard: Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.// Sheldon: You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings.// Amy: Come on, Sheldon, let’s go.// Sheldon: Gladly. Can we storm out?// Amy: I think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it.// Sheldon: Fine. I’ll just give them the finger.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj: Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes.// Howard: No, he doesn’t think it’s stupid.// Raj: Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we’ll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior.// Howard: Hey, you went out with him. I didn’t.// Raj: Okay, uh, let’s get things started. Um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?// Lucy: Oh, okay. Um, I’m Lucy, and I broke up with Raj because I have severe social anxiety, and he kept trying to force me into uncomfortable situations.// Howard: Like this one?// Lucy: Yeah.// Raj: I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?// Howard: Schmuck. Got it.// Raj: Uh, next?// Claire: Okay. Um, I’m Claire. And I guess I broke up with you because you were just really needy. Also, you were incredibly vain, like, all the time you spent shaping your eyebrows.// Raj: Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?// Emily: Ooh, I’m not sure I’m comfortable sharing details about our relationship in front of Howard.// Raj: Oh. He’s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him.// Emily: Okay. Well, whenever you and I were in bed…// Raj: Howard, get out.// Howard: Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: Sheldon, dinner’s ready. I made beef loaf, because I know you’re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?// Sheldon: Not really.// Amy: What’s going on?// Sheldon: I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it.// Amy: I’m sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.// Sheldon: It’s more than that. It’s me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real.// Amy: Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I can’t see without my glasses. And right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge.// Sheldon: I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I’m not.// Amy: Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell.// Sheldon: Yeah, but that’s shooting fish in a barrel. You’re kind of a sad sack. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I’m just upset.// Amy: No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And I’m proud of you, for reasons I’m sure have something to do with my father. And if you don’t like that machine, get rid of it. Because I love you exactly the way you are.// Sheldon: I feel the same way about you. Now, put your glasses back on. You look weird.// Howard (translating for other Emily): I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents.// (translating for other Emily)// Emily: Oh, yeah, that used to drive me nuts. He’s kind of a mama’s boy.// Claire: Kind of?// Raj: Okay, that’s enough. Write down loving son.// Lucy: Can I just say something? Going out with Raj was one of the best things that ever happened to me.// Raj: Yes, I’ll take you back.// Lucy: Let me finish. It’s like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don’t want in a man.// Raj: Well, that’s hard to hear, but I’ll still take you back.// Emily: You know, the same thing happened to me. After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary, who’s just amazing.// Howard: Sorry, is that Gary with one R or two?// Raj: Would you stop writing? Wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?// Lucy: Oh, yeah.// Emily: Without question.// Claire: Little before, actually.// Howard (responding to other Emily): Oh, wow. Don’t let him get away.// (responding to other Emily)// Raj: What did she say?// Howard: Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne.// Raj: Okay, maybe we should just end this.// Howard: Wait, hang on. I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. Even at the risk of being humiliated. And I, for one, think that’s very brave.// Raj: Thank you, Howard.// Emily: Honestly, I’m surprised you two didn’t wind up together.// Howard: Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s door.// Sheldon: Yes?// Leonard: We owe you an apology.// Sheldon: Oh, it’s fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasn’t home, you borrowed a suitcase.// Leonard: That was six years ago. I’m talking about tonight.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order.// Penny: Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it.// Leonard: And, sorry about the suitcase.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that you’ve resolved your conflict.// Penny: Yes, we’re fine.// Leonard: Mm, Penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for Randall to visit.// Penny: Hopefully, he won’t be too upset.// Leonard: Oh, you’re his little girl, he can’t stay mad at you.// Penny: He won’t be mad at me. I mean, you’re the one who doesn’t want my brother to come, so…// Leonard: So you’re gonna throw me under the bus?// Penny: Oh, I’m gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal.// Sheldon: Uh, guys, it sounds like you’re getting angry again.// Leonard: That’s because we are.// Sheldon: Yes. I don’t need an emotion machine. I am one.// Howard: Thanks, ladies, this was fun. Let’s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night.// Raj: Well, that was a waste of time. I’m such an idiot.// Howard: Don’t beat yourself up. That’s what I’m here for.// Raj: Maybe I won’t settle down. Maybe I’ll just play the field.// Howard: Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no.// Raj: Dude, come on.// Howard: Okay, I’ll tell you what. I’ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and Bernadette, you and I can give it a go.// Raj: I appreciate the offer, but if things don’t work out with you two, I’m swooping in on her like a vulture.// Howard: Too late. Stuart called dibs.// Raj: But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? Like, print up announcements?// Howard: I don’t know. What difference does it make?// Raj: Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades.// Howard: Those do look fun.// Raj: Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip.// Howard: If you didn’t want me to eat it, why’d you put it out?// Raj: It was for the girls. They broke up with me, I don’t care if they get fat.// Howard: I’m not gonna get fat.// Raj: Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise.// Howard: Fine. Look, I’ll exercise right now. One, two. These are crunches, by the way.// Raj: Very mature. Keep eating like that, you’re gonna have a heart attack.// Howard: Okay. How about if I eat like this?// Raj: You’re such a child.// Howard: Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?// Raj: Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you.// Howard: Please. When you see the ring I pick out, you’re gonna melt.// Raj: Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, don’t tell me, I want to be surprised.// Penny: So, did you wind up sending that machine back?// Sheldon: I did. You know, I’m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad.// Bernadette: I finally got Halley to sleep.// Raj: You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years.// Amy: It’s true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.// Penny: So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up.// Leonard: We can’t. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.// Sheldon: Hey, uh, Bernadette, let’s test this theory. What do you think I’m feeling right now?// Bernadette: Let’s see. You’re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don’t have to be us.// Sheldon: Keep filling this one with babies. She’s good.Series 10 Episode 15 – The Locomotion Reverberation// Scene: The laboratory.// Howard: Okay, I’m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.// Leonard: Nicely done, Howard.// Howard: Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.// Leonard: Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.// Howard: Those are just the things I say out loud.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.// Howard: What’s wrong?// Sheldon: I’m looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.// Leonard: That’s great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We’re good to go.// Howard: Yeah. It doesn’t need to be smaller.// Sheldon: Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics.// Leonard: Can we please stop talking about poodles?// Sheldon: Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.// Howard: Sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home.// Sheldon: I don’t want to go home.// Leonard: Fine, go for a little walk.// Sheldon: Then what?// Leonard: Just keep walking.// Credits sequence.// Leonard: At least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.// Howard: I know. That’s why I keep refilling his water when he’s not looking.// Leonard: You’re kidding.// Howard: I don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it.// Leonard: You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time.// Howard: We can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him.// Leonard: You can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point.// Sheldon: Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best.// Leonard: Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.// Sheldon: Really?// Leonard: Yeah. Go ahead, open it.// Sheldon: Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesn’t happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again.// Leonard: Okay. Where were we?// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Bernadette: For Howie’s occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?// Amy: Well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?// Penny: I can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.// Raj: Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant.// Bernadette: Well, I didn’t. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off.// Raj: Whoa. Just trying to help.// Bernadette: Sorry. Howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on.// Amy: Is there anything we can do?// Bernadette: Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back.// Raj: No, no. I will take care of it.// Bernadette: Oh, thank you.// Raj: While I’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.// Penny: All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, I’m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing.// Bernadette: That sounds really nice.// Amy: Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.// Penny: Okay, that’s the one to beat.// Amy: Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: Hey, you’re home early.// Sheldon: You’ll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.// Amy: Wow. He finally used it. What’d you do?// Sheldon: No idea. All I know is I’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.// Amy: Well, I’m really happy for you.// Sheldon: Oh, no. It’s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.// Amy: I give up.// Sheldon: You.// Amy: No. I really give up.// Sheldon: Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.// Amy: Can I pee now?// Sheldon: Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. There’s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? You’re missing// some great stuff out here. Oh, this is good. There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for. But that is the figurative you, not the literal you. I’ll be blowing the whistle. Amy, get up. It’s time to go to work.// Leonard: This train thing worked out better than I thought. He’s home studying the engineer’s manual.// Howard: It’s so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?// Leonard: Four thousand dollars, worth every penny.// Col Williams: Gentlemen.// Leonard: Colonel Williams. Sir.// Col Williams: Just wanted to see how the guidance system’s coming along.// Howard: Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.// Leonard: As a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool.// Col Williams: Don’t do that. What’s this?// Leonard: Oh, nothing. Just some math we don’t need.// Col Williams: This is a different approach. Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?// Leonard: It’s just a theory. Uh, it’s not even worked out.// Col Williams: Oh. I want this.// Howard: But we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations.// Col Williams: So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.// Leonard: Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.// Col Williams: Yeah, I want this.// Howard: Okay, but that’s just a theory. It’s not even a complete thought.// Col Williams: You both make excellent points, and thank you for presenting it so articulately. Make this.// Howard: The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Penny: All right. You guys ready to get crazy?// Amy: Well, the bra under here ain’t beige.// Raj: Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.// Stuart: Don’t worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart’s on the job.// Raj: Under the careful supervision of her godfather.// Stuart: My apologies. I didn’t mean to offend you, Don Corleone.// Raj: Like I said, you ladies have fun.// Bernadette: We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let’s party.// Penny: You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we’ll get free drinks.// Bernadette: Call if there’s any problems.// Penny: No. She’s busy. You call Howard.// Raj: Got it.// Bernadette: Call me. Don’t call Howard.// Raj: I would never call Howard.// Stuart: Okay, instead of arguing all night, let’s just split up the baby chores.// Raj: Yeah, great. Um, I’ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.// Scene: The stairwell.// Howard: I can’t believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.// Leonard: Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?// Howard: I don’t know, but if he yells It’s alive, we run.// Sheldon: Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn’t hear you. I’m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?// Howard: How’d you even get that up the stairs?// Sheldon: I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldn’t, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.// Leonard: Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can’t do it without you.// Sheldon: Interesting. Well, so I was right.// Howard: Open a window. It’s about to get smug in here.// Sheldon: Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don’t think I can go back to theory. I’m an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are.// Leonard: Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out.// Sheldon: Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won’t look foolish.// Howard: He’s worried about looking foolish. That’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there.// Leonard: Come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?// Sheldon: Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Amy: Hey, did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?// Bernadette: Not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.// Penny: Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun.// Amy: Nothing says fun like being scolded.// Bernadette (phone rings): Oh, it’s Raj. Everything okay?// (phone rings)// Raj: Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.// Stuart: Hang up, we don’t need help.// Raj: I don’t need your help deciding when we need help!// Bernadette: Raj, what’s going on?// Raj: Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday.// Stuart: It says Tuesday.// Raj: How is that a T?// Bernadette: I’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer.// Raj: Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.// Stuart: You’re wasting perfectly good milk.// Raj: Fine, you drink it.// Stuart: It’s just milk.// Bernadette: Stuart, don’t you drink my milk.// Penny: Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?// Raj: Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge.// Stuart: Hmm. So we just throw this away?// Raj: What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?// Stuart: Well, I don’t take it black.// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I’m sure we can figure the rest out.// Howard: All right. Hmm. Feel free to jump in. Hmm is all I got.// Leonard: Oh, we can get this. Is there any chance it’s upside-down?// Howard: Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.// Leonard: It’s classified. If we tell anyone, we’d get in trouble.// Howard: Hey, I came up with that and hmm. You haven’t pitched anything.// Leonard: Just keep thinking. I got it.// Howard: You really figured it out?// Leonard: No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it.// Howard: Oh, you’re a genius.// Leonard: Yeah, I know. That’s not even a math symbol. That’s just Charlie Brown’s hair.// Scene: Penny’s car// Penny: Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those.// Amy: Renaissance Choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?// Bernadette (on phone): Hello?// (on phone)// Raj: Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.// Stuart: She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her.// Raj: She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.// Bernadette: You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?// Stuart: Wait. She’s settling down.// Raj: Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography.// Penny: Is everything okay?// Bernadette: Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.// Amy: Hey, there’s another dance club nearby. I mean, I don’t know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open.// Penny: Maybe we should just call it a night.// Amy: You sure? They’re open till dos.// Bernadette: Yeah, we’re all dressed up. Why go home?// Penny: I’m just not really in the mood anymore.// Bernadette: What’s going on with you?// Penny: I don’t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.// Bernadette: I’m not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.// Amy: I’m not sad. I mean, hello.// Penny: Okay, maybe I’m the one who’s sad.// Amy: What are you sad about?// Penny: Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.// Bernadette: You’re upset I had a baby?// Penny: No, of course not. I just, I didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings.// Amy: What feelings?// Penny: Pressure. I mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.// Bernadette: You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I’m constantly worried, I’m always tired, and in a few minutes I’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.// Penny: I get that, okay? It’s just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating.// Amy: Come on. You’ve got so much to feel good about. You’ve got a great job now.// Penny: Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.// Amy: You make more than I do.// Bernadette: You may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great.// Amy: It’s bigger than mine.// Bernadette: And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.// Amy: I’m not even engaged once. I don’t even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I’m not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…// Bernadette: Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.// Amy: I’m sorry. I can’t help it.// Penny: Oh, that’s gonna make me cry.// Bernadette: And there they go.// Penny: Ew.// Leonard: Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn’t need you after all.// Howard: That’s right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasn’t even that hard.// Leonard: No.// Sheldon: Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I’m okay with it.// Leonard: Aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?// Sheldon: No, thanks. I’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump.// Howard: It’s a manifold.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, I guess it’s fixed.// Leonard: Just look at the board.// Sheldon: That’s wrong.// Leonard: Oh, no, what should we have done differently?// Sheldon: Well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.// Howard: Told ya. Can you fix it for us?// Sheldon: Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads.// Leonard: Come on, Sheldon. You can’t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff.// Howard: But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know.// Leonard: And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.// Howard: And with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. You’d be the king of the train store.// Sheldon: Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I’m already king of the train store.// Leonard: So, what do you say?// Sheldon: Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. I’m like the crankshaft of this team.// Howard: That’s a turbo.// Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.// Scene: The cab of a steam locomotive.// Sheldon: I apologize that it’s so warm in here.// Amy: It is warm in here.// Sheldon: I’ve worked up a bit of a sweat.// Amy: Me, too.// Sheldon: May I borrow your water?// Sheldon (voice): The light’s green.// (voice)// Amy (now in her car): Sorry.// (now in her car)// Sheldon: GPS says we’ll be at the railway in three hours.// Amy: I can get us there in two.Series 10 Episode 16 – The Allowance Evaporation// Scene: The apartment.// Howard: Go. Come on, Raj.// Leonard: You can do this.// Sheldon: There’s no way.// Penny: What is happening?// Leonard: This is an Euler’s Disk. It’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.// Penny: Aw, look at you watching sports.// Howard: We’re betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.// Sheldon: Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.// Leonard: But Raj is from India, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath.// Penny: Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.// Amy: Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.// Sheldon: Kind of busy right now.// Amy: Oh, an Euler’s Disk, fun.// Howard: Yeah, we’re seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.// Amy: Oh. Immature.// Leonard: How ya doing?// Sheldon: He’s not gonna make it.// Howard: Yes, he is.// Sheldon: You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.// Penny: Yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?// Howard: Ha, you’re interested. You’re out ten bucks.// Sheldon: It’s slowing down.// Leonard: Dig deep, like when we bet you couldn’t fit into Howard’s pants.// Leonard: Yes, he is.// Howard: Come on, Raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just Waiting to Exhale. Yeah, I knew you could do it.// Raj: And j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is Princess Bride.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Raj’s office.// Dr Koothrapalli (on skype): Hello, Rajesh. How are things by you?// (on skype)// Raj: Good, good. Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.// Dr Koothrapalli: Well, you’re a grown man with a steady job. Why wouldn’t you spend all your father’s money?// Raj: Oh, Daddy, you’re so rich and funny.// Dr Koothrapalli: Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?// Raj: Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.// Dr Koothrapalli: I’m sorry to hear that.// Raj: I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.// Dr Koothrapalli: Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.// Raj: You did?// Dr Koothrapalli: It’s too much work. You’re an adult who can’t get by without an allowance from his parents. Women don’t want that.// Raj: What are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?// Dr Koothrapalli: I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient. I don’t think I’m the problem.// Raj: I can’t believe what I’m hearing. This is deeply hurtful.// Dr Koothrapalli: You’re also too sensitive. Women don’t want that either.// Scene: A restaurant.// Amy: The food here’s supposed to be great. Don’t fill up on chips.// Sheldon: Oh, I won’t. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didn’t see that.// Amy: Oh, look. It’s Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi.// Sheldon: Why?// Amy: Because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.// Sheldon: I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.// Amy: Sheldon, there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.// Sheldon: If the judge couldn’t explain it to me, I don’t see how you will.// Amy: Hi, Bert.// Sheldon: Hello.// Bert: Oh, hey, guys. What brings you here?// Amy: Oh, we’re having date night.// Bert: Nice. I’m meeting someone, too.// Amy: Oh, really. Anybody we know?// Bert: I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony. That’s a Web site for geologists to find love.// Amy: That’s a real thing?// Bert: Yeah. Their slogan is we’re all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind.// Sheldon: Well, have a lovely evening.// Bert: Thanks. You, too.// Sheldon: If you think that’s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you’re crazy.// Penny: You know, we could’ve come to you guys. You didn’t have to bring the baby here.// Bernadette: Oh, it’s okay. It’s good to get out of the house.// Howard: And the car ride puts her to sleep.// Leonard: Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.// Penny: Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.// Leonard: Who forgot to crack the window?// Raj: Hello.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: Oh, someone’s been shopping at Gucci.// Raj: Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn’t resist.// Bernadette: That’s so sweet of you.// Raj: Yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape.// Howard: Oh, no, now we have two.// Penny: That must’ve been expensive.// Raj: Yeah, it was. But it’s my father’s money and I’m mad at him.// Leonard: What’s going on with your dad?// Penny: And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel.// Raj: It turns out he doesn’t care if I’m married or if I’m single. He’s basically given up on me.// Bernadette: Oh, I’m sure that’s not true.// Raj: It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.// Leonard: But all you did was complain when he did that.// Penny: Wait, Leonard, he’s hurting. Let him feel how he feels.// Raj: Thank you, Penny.// Penny: Yeah. Shoes, I’m a seven-and-a-half, boots, I’m an eight.// Scene: The restaurant.// Sheldon: MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?// Amy: Sorry, I don’t have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.// Bert: Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I’m gonna head out.// Amy: Oh, no. Are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes?// Bert: Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it’s time to cut bait.// Amy: I’m so sorry.// Sheldon: Bert, I insist that you join us.// Bert: You really wouldn’t mind?// Sheldon: Not at all. Amy?// Amy: Fine with me.// Bert: Thanks. I’ll go grab a chair.// Amy: Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.// Sheldon: Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.// Amy: So the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?// Sheldon: You want me to look at him and listen to him?// Raj: My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled.// Leonard: I’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?// Raj: Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled.// Penny: All right, how much exactly does he pay for?// Raj: Okay, I’ll tell you, but please don’t judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.// Leonard: I’m trying, but I’m judging.// Howard: Maybe your dad’s right.// Penny: Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.// Raj: But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.// Bernadette: Yeah, maybe your dad’s right.// Bert: Good question. Let’s see. Infoseek, WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.// Amy: Okay, literally any other topic.// Bert: All right. How did you guys meet?// Sheldon: Actually, we met online.// Amy: Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.// Sheldon: Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again.// Bert: Well, I really envy your relationship. Other than you two only having sex once a year, you’re the perfect couple.// Amy: You-you know about that?// Bert: Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.// Amy: Were you aware of this?// Sheldon: No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.// Scene: The stairwell.// Sheldon: Why aren’t you talking to me?// Amy: Because I’m mad at you.// Sheldon: Oh. Well, now I’m sorry I asked.// Amy: Sheldon, it’s humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.// Sheldon: What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.// Amy: That’s why they’re doing it.// Sheldon: Is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? If you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works.// Howard: You don’t need your dad’s money. You can get by on your salary.// Leonard: Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and we’ve always been fine.// Raj: Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.// Penny: All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let’s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?// Raj: I don’t want to say.// Bernadette: Is it really that high?// Raj: I don’t want to say because I don’t know how much it is.// Penny: You don’t how much your rent is?// Raj: My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?// Penny: Yeah.// Raj: Well, then double it, because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump.// Leonard: Do you know how much your car costs?// Raj: Not really.// Howard: Well, how much do you spend on food?// Raj: The housekeeper does the shopping.// Bernadette: Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.// Raj: I’m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: I’m going to bed.// Sheldon: Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together.// Amy: So?// Sheldon: I’m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized.// Amy: I’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not.// Sheldon: This isn’t fair. You’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.// Amy: That’s different. She’s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches.// Sheldon: That lady has a name. I don’t know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom.// Leonard: Sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live.// Bernadette: When you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. How’d you get by?// Penny: Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of ’em.// Leonard: Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?// Howard: What, what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don’t you like me?// Raj: I thought we were best friends?// Howard: We are, that’s why I’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless.// Bernadette: I’m sorry, Raj. We really just don’t have the space.// Leonard: What if he lives in your garage?// Bernadette: What if you stop helping?// Raj: Guys, I’m not living in a garage.// Howard: Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?// Bernadette: That’s a great idea.// Penny: Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.// Raj: Thank you, but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father.// Penny: Okay, only if you’re sure. Whew.// Leonard: Yeah.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?// (Knock, knock, knock)// Amy: Yeah?// Sheldon: Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I’ll take it.// Amy: What is this?// Sheldon: I’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don’t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I’m saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.// Amy: Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?// Sheldon: No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.// Amy: Well, I do appreciate you working on this.// Sheldon: I’m sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.// Amy: What’s that little dot in the middle?// Sheldon: That’s reserved for thoughts I don’t share with anyone.// Amy: Interesting. You really have secrets you don’t tell me?// Sheldon: Of course.// Amy: Can I hear one?// Sheldon: No, they’re private.// Amy: Why? Are they naughty?// Sheldon: A little.// Amy: Please?// Sheldon: Fine. Two years ago I got my driver’s license.// Amy: What? Why didn’t you say anything?// Sheldon: I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.// Amy: So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn’t have to?// Sheldon: No, you didn’t. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important.// Dr Koothrapalli (on skype): What?// Raj: Hello, Father. We need to talk.// Dr Koothrapalli: All right.// Raj: I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I’m a man, and I can take care of myself.// Dr Koothrapalli: That’s wonderful.// Raj: Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.// Dr Koothrapalli: I am so proud of you.// Raj: Dad, I’m trying to tell you off, and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief.// Dr Koothrapalli: Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money. Where did I fail as a father?// Raj: Yeah, that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Leonard: Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you.// Raj: Yeah, I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker.// Howard: Oh. How’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?// Raj: Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem.// Sheldon: Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. We’re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people’s lives.// Bert: He’s right. And I’m sorry for the part I played in this.// Sheldon: Thank you, Bert. You’re a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.// Bert: That doesn’t paint me in the best light.// Sheldon: Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – That better?// Bert: Not really.// Sheldon: All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.// Leonard: What brought that on?// Sheldon: Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.// Howard: That’s understandable.// Sheldon: Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.Series 10 Episode 17 – The Comic-Con Conundrum// Following a “previously on” sequence:// Scene: The apartment.// Sheldon: Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.// Raj: How bad is it?// Sheldon: Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?// Raj: Are you serious?// Sheldon: I’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Hey.// Penny: Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.// Leonard: We’re helping Raj figure out his finances.// Penny: Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?// Sheldon: Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping.// Penny: Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look.// Sheldon: He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.// Howard: I thought your dad paid your cards.// Raj: I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.// Sheldon: What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?// Raj: That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.// Leonard: What is Pink Cheeks?// Raj: It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.// Leonard: Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.// Raj: Like a business manager?// Sheldon: No, absolutely not. You can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.// Howard: What if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?// Sheldon: He sounds like a sociopath.// Leonard: We don’t know, his mother never had him tested.// Sheldon: You’re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.// Penny: Wait, wait, who’s gonna break it to the penguin?// Raj: Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize.// Sheldon: Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can’t buy one.// Howard: Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: You’re actually going to Comic-Con?// Penny: Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I’d tag along.// Amy: Well, that’s sweet. I bet you’ll have fun.// Penny: So, do you want to come?// Amy: No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to.// Penny: Please? I went to your boring thing last month.// Amy: My aunt’s funeral?// Penny: Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.// Amy: Well, I’m not going, but I do think it’s nice you want to.// Penny: It’s not that I want to go, I just think it’ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.// Amy: Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here.// Scene: The comic book store.// Howard: You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?// Leonard: No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon’s job.// Sheldon: She’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.// Howard: And hate all the crowds at the panels.// Sheldon: She’s gonna hate the panels.// Leonard: She’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.// Howard: Why don’t you just tell her not to come?// Leonard: Well, she’s so excited, I can’t do that to her.// Howard: What if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?// Leonard: That I would do to her.// Raj: I can’t believe Penny’s gonna get to go, and I’m not.// Sheldon: You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.// Stuart: Panels. Just wanted to be included.// Raj; Come on, Sheldon, it’s Comic-Con. Just let me have the money for this, and I won’t ask for anything else.// Sheldon: You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.// Leonard: See? Miserable.// Raj: Okay, you’re right, I got myself into this, but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.// Sheldon: Your father may have spoiled you, but I won’t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.// Howard: Yeah, you’re a grown man who’s highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you.// Raj: Go ahead, make jokes. I don’t know why you think you’re going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby.// Howard: So?// Raj: Well, so? So you think Bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?// Leonard: Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can’t afford it, Howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.// Sheldon: I’m gonna go as Dumbledore.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: Mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?// Bernadette: Okay.// Howard: What you doing?// Bernadette: Making lasagna.// Howard: Oh, she’s sexy, she can cook. I’m such a lucky guy.// Bernadette: You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?// Howard: No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.// Bernadette: Oh, dear God, you’re cheating on me with Raj.// Howard: Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but it’s not a big deal.// Bernadette: What is it?// Howard: Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I’m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go.// Bernadette: It’s so hard to say no to you.// Howard: Thank you.// Bernadette: So I’ll say maybe.// Howard: What? Why?// Bernadette: You said tickets don’t go on sale till Friday, right?// Howard: Yeah.// Bernadette: You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?// Bernadette: See where I’m going with this?// Bernadette: If you don’t know how to make lasagna, Google does.// Leonard: Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are.// Penny: Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.// Leonard: I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where’s Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.// Penny: Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?// Leonard: Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here’s the hotel room we all share.// Penny: Well, you and I would get our own room, right?// Leonard: Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon’s feet and my head? That’s where you go.// Penny: Well, it’s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.// Leonard: Don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it’s off the chain mail.// Leonard: I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go.// Sheldon: That’s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.// Stuart: Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box.// Raj: But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.// Stuart: I know. And I did it with a straight face.// Raj: But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.// Stuart: Well, all right. I’ll give you 25 bucks. That’s my best offer.// Raj: I have no choice.// Stuart: You know, if you want to make extra money, I could throw some work your way.// Raj: Really? I’ll do anything.// Stuart: Great, you’re hired. First thing you can do is put price tags on these. Start the little ones at fifty.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Penny: You know, it’s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days.// Amy: Comic-Con’s five days.// Penny: Are you kidding me?// Amy: Why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go?// Penny: I can’t, it’ll break his heart. You know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside.// Amy: He is an indoor cat.// Penny: You know, maybe it won’t be that bad. Leonard says it’s really mainstream now. Comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.// Bernadette (off): Howie, can you get that?// (off)// Howard (off): Kind of busy.// Bernadette (off): Busy like I’ll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?// Howard: Hey.// Raj: What’s with the gloves?// Howard: They complete my ensemble. What do you want?// Raj: I’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.// Howard: Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?// Bernadette: No.// Howard: I tried.// Leonard: Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.// Penny: Is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?// Leonard: Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.// Penny: Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?// Leonard: Yeah, of course, why?// Penny: This is just something you usually do together, and if I’m screwing it up, I don’t have to go.// Leonard: Oh, why? Do you not want to go?// Penny: Why? Do you not want me to go?// Leonard: No, I want you to go.// Penny: Okay, good, ’cause that’s what I want, too.// Leonard: Now we’re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don’t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.// Sheldon: If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don’t want that either.// Leonard: Is that nice?// Sheldon: No, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.// Leonard: Uh, it’s more complicated than that.// Sheldon: I’m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole.// Leonard: Do you think she’s as honest with you?// Sheldon: I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I’d like to think she meant it.// Howard: There’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.// Raj: Yeah, you’d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.// Bernadette: I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.// Raj: Here, let me help you.// Bernadette: Thank you.// Raj: Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you.// Bernadette: There she goes.// Raj: Stay, I’ll get her.// Bernadette: I appreciate it.// Raj: That’s fine. She and I can cry together.// Bernadette: He’s such a sweetie.// Howard: I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.// Bernadette: If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over.// Howard: Yeah, that’s working out great for me.// Amy: Penny says they’re ready to go.// Sheldon: Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.// Amy: Sheldon, women can wear make up, it’s not lying.// Sheldon: I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?// Amy: Wait, wait, wait, what’s Leonard lying about?// Sheldon: He doesn’t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He’s just doing it to make her happy.// Amy: Really? Because she doesn’t actually want to go. She’s just doing it to make him happy.// Sheldon: So they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to tell them.// Amy: No, you’re not gonna tell them anything. You’re gonna stay out of it.// Sheldon: Why?// Amy: Because it’s between them.// Sheldon: Well, if you haven’t noticed, I’ve been between them for the last ten years.// Penny: Hey.// Amy: Hi.// Sheldon: Hello.// Penny: Hey, babe, you want to drive?// Leonard: Sure, or you can.// Penny: No, it’s fine, I know you don’t like the way I drive.// Leonard: I don’t have a problem with your driving.// Sheldon: Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.// Amy: Shh.// Penny: Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.// Leonard: He wasn’t in a car, but okay.// Penny: Just say you want to drive.// Leonard: I honestly don’t.// Penny: Amy, do us a favour, please drive.// Amy: Sure, happy to.// Leonard: If you want to drive, just drive. I don’t see why this has to be so complicated.// Penny: It’s not complicated. Amy’s driving, that’s it.// Leonard: That’s not it because you’re clearly upset.// Penny: You’re the one who seems upset.// Leonard: Why would I be upset?// Amy: Because you don’t want her to go to Comic-Con.// Sheldon: This is an interesting way to stay out of it.// Penny: Wait, you don’t want me to go?// Leonard: Well, I just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time.// Sheldon: Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. You set ’em up, I knock ’em down, good job.// Leonard: Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?// Penny: I just thought it would make you happy.// Leonard: O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and I don’t need to bring you, is everything good?// Penny: Hold on, I’m trying to decide if I’m mad at you. No, I’m happy I don’t have to go.// Leonard: All right, problem solved.// Penny: Okay.// Sheldon: Not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…// Amy: Oh, my God, stop talking.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.// Amy: The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?// Bernadette: Kinda.// Howard: Dinner’s almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat.// Penny: Hey, if you’re still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket.// Raj: Thank you, but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year.// Sheldon: Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.// Bernadette: Howie?// Howard: Sure. This is for you.// Raj: What’s this?// Bernadette: It’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you’ve done.// Howard: There’s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.// Stuart: Um, I also take care of Halley.// Bernadette: And you live here for free.// Stuart: I do, ma’am, thank you, ma’am.// Raj: This is so generous of you, I, um, I don’t know what to say.// Leonard: Now you can come with us.// Penny: Yeah, there’s room in the bed by Sheldon’s feet.// Raj: As much as I appreciate this, I can’t accept it, okay? Halley’s my goddaughter, I don’t take care of her for money.// Stuart: I would.// Bernadette: Keep it. Consider it a gift.// Sheldon: Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?// Bernadette: What’s the difference?// Sheldon: When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.// Raj: It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that.// Amy: So you’re not going to Comic-Con?// Raj: I’ve been plenty of times. If I miss one, it’s fine. I’m a big boy.// Sheldon: I’m a big boy, and if I missed one, I’d throw a big-boy tantrum.// Leonard: You know what? I’ve gone 12 times. Maybe I’ll sit out this year, too.// Penny: Really?// Leonard: Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.// Penny: Ooh, how about white-water rafting?// Leonard: Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?// Howard: You know what, I’m not gonna go either. I’m a father now. I’d rather spend time with my family.// Bernadette: You just don’t want to go alone with Sheldon.// Howard: I’m gonna go check on dinner.// Amy: Sounds like everyone’s staying home. What do you say?// Sheldon: Nuts to that, I’m going to Comic-Con.// Amy: By yourself?// Sheldon: Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.// Stuart: I’ll go with you.// Sheldon: That’s very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July.// Sheldon: There’s my pretty girlfriend.// Amy: I’m not going with you to Comic-Con.// Sheldon: What? Can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?// Amy: He can, but it’s still not changing my mind.// Sheldon: Well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. It’s a list of this year’s panelists. It’s long, isn’t it?Series 10 Episode 18 – The Escape Hatch Identification// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?// Penny: What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?// Leonard: No. He can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.// Bernadette: What’s so funny?// Howard: Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote India.// Bernadette: Don’t post that, be supportive.// Howard: Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?// Bernadette: We’re smart. I’m sure we can think of something.// Howard: You want to let him live here?// Bernadette: Oh, we’re smarter than that.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.// Sheldon: I know our apartment’s small, but I think we can make room.// Amy: No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.// Leonard: We do have Sheldon’s old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.// Penny: You’re a good friend.// Leonard: Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?// Penny: You’re an even better husband.// Howard: I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me.// Bernadette: Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.// Howard: Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.// Bernadette: That sounds awful.// Howard: Let’s hope he thinks so, too.// Amy: For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.// Sheldon: Wow. I’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Raj’s apartment.// Raj (answering phone): Hello.// (answering phone)// Howard: Hey, uh, so we’ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you.// Raj: That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in.// Howard: I know it’s not ideal, but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down.// Raj: I cannot thank you enough.// Howard: It is our pleasure. (beep, beep, beep) Hey, can you hold on one sec? Hello?// (beep, beep, beep)// Leonard: Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?// Raj: Uh, yeah. Why do you ask?// Leonard: You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours.// Raj: Oh, my God, that’s so generous.// Leonard: It’s the least we can do.// Raj: I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?// Howard: Well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems.// Raj: But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?// Howard: Yeah. We barely use it, so it’ll be like it’s yours.// Raj: Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second.// Howard: What?// Raj: Hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?// Leonard: I don’t have a loofah.// Raj: Okay, well, if I move in, you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?// Howard: I don’t know. Why are you asking all these questions?// Raj: Well, to be honest, Leonard’s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom.// Howard: Great. Go live there.// Raj: But you made the garage sound so fun.// Howard: I just didn’t want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there.// Raj: One second. Okay, I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?// Penny: Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?// Raj: Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.// Scene: The lobby.// Leonard: Hey.// Amy: Hi.// Sheldon: Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine.// Penny: What’s it for?// Sheldon: Roofing.// Penny: Yeah, it’s yours.// Sheldon: Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, I’m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.// Leonard: Yeah, for a little while.// Sheldon: What about his dog?// Penny: She’ll be in her crate, it’s not a big deal.// Sheldon: I suppose that’s acceptable.// Amy: Well, Sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.// Sheldon: If real dogs gave me buttons, I’d like them, too. Well, I think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend.// Leonard: And I think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication Amy’s clearly giving you.// Sheldon: And what is that supposed to mean?// Penny: Well, it’s like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.// Leonard: Just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter.// Penny: Mm-hmm.// Sheldon: If you’re implying that I’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it.// Leonard: Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.// Amy: Don’t listen to them. What’s weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.// Sheldon: I mean, it’s unfair; people just assume I’m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.// Amy: But you are, aren’t you?// Sheldon: Oh, I’m outraged.// Amy: Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on.// Sheldon: Well, that’s been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren’t me.// Amy: There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.// Sheldon: Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.// Amy: And there is the love of which I speak.// Sheldon: I realize it’s irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I’m feeling a bit replaced.// Amy: Well, this isn’t an easy time for him. He’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated.// Sheldon: Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?// Raj: Can I get anyone anything at all?// Penny: Raj, you don’t have to serve us.// Raj: It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.// Howard: It was really no problem.// Bernadette: Not for you, box of towels.// Raj: Anyway, thanks again.// Howard: Hey, look at that. You’ve got a Raj, we’ve got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together.// Leonard: I don’t know. Yours looks like he has worms.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: You ready to go?// Sheldon: All set.// Amy: What’s that?// Sheldon: A housewarming gift for Raj.// Amy: Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present.// Sheldon: It’s nothing like that. I just, I thought about Raj’s situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello.// Penny: Hi.// Leonard: Perfect timing. Food’s ready.// Sheldon: Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj.// Penny: Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that.// Amy: No. I already asked.// Raj: Thank you, Sheldon. It’s a blank notebook.// Sheldon: Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I’m sure you will, too.// Howard: He also never had sex in that room. That’s something else to look forward to.// Raj: This means a lot.// Sheldon: Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. You’re losing your apartment, you’re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated.// Amy: Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy’s words.// Sheldon: I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.// Raj: You’re right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You’re such a jerk.// Sheldon: Can you believe this guy?// Everyone: Yes.// Sheldon: I thought that was gonna break the other way.// Amy: Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place.// Sheldon: Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you’re happy.// Raj: What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck.// Sheldon: How come he can say it and I can’t?// Amy: Just keep walking.// Beverley (on skype): Hello, Sheldon. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?// (on skype)// Sheldon: Honestly, I’ve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you’re very busy these days.// Beverley: Oh, I just say that because he prattles. What’s going on?// Sheldon: Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.// Beverley: Mm. Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?// Sheldon: Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?// Beverley: Very well, but, uh, if you don’t mind, I’d still like to pause for effect. Now, you’ve recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?// Sheldon: I have.// Beverley: Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you’re forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.// Sheldon: I hadn’t thought about that.// Amy: And don’t start thinking about it now.// Beverley: Hello, Amy. Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with Sheldon.// Amy: That’s not true.// Beverley: She said defensively.// Amy: This isn’t about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.// Beverley: Interesting. They’ve found a need to take yet another room mate. Seems they’re avoiding some harsh realities themselves.// Sheldon: I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, you’re good.// Beverley: That is the word on the street, dear.// Raj: Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day, I’m already causing problems.// Penny: You didn’t do anything. It’s Sheldon.// Leonard: You didn’t do anything, it’s Sheldon. That’d make a nice needlepoint pillow.// Penny: So, relax. We’re happy to have you.// Raj: Thank you, but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?// Penny: Do you actually pay for that haircut?// Raj: That’ll do it.// Sheldon: Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?// Raj: Sheldon, she’s fine.// Sheldon: Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she’s stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.// Raj: Thank you. I appreciate that.// Sheldon: No, I can’t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better.// Leonard: I don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother.// Sheldon: Beverly pointed out that I’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.// Penny: What are you talking about? We’re fine.// Sheldon: Yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it’s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, I’m sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to McDonald’s.// Beverley (on skype): Hello, Leonard.// Leonard: Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don’t have marital problems.// Beverley: I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.// Leonard: Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.// Penny: Yeah, this is a special circumstance.// Beverley: Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well.// Penny: Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special.// Beverley: Do you agree with that?// Leonard: Well, now that you point it out…// Penny: Are you kidding me?// Leonard: We do seem to keep finding room mates.// Penny: Now you’re taking her side?// Beverley: Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard. That’s for your parade of room mates to do.// Raj: Howard? Howard? It’s me, it’s just me.// Howard: What are you doing here?// Raj: Well, I texted you, but you didn’t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing.// Stuart: Not on my watch.// Bernadette: It’s fine. It’s just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine.// Stuart: And if my heart stops, just let me go.// Raj: I’m sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems.// Howard: I’ll say it again. India.// Raj: Can I just stay in the garage?// Bernadette: Don’t do that. We’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.// Raj: Thank you.// Stuart: Come on, I’ll get you some sheets. Then I’ll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine.// Howard: Never should’ve had all these kids so close together.// Amy: You okay?// Sheldon: I can’t sleep.// Amy: What’s wrong?// Sheldon: Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.// Amy: Is that bothering you?// Sheldon: Yes. I don’t care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.// Amy: I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain.// Sheldon: What if she’s correct? Doesn’t that say something troubling about us?// Amy: I don’t know. I just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.// Sheldon: That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?// Amy: You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. It’s not a good influence.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s living room.// Stuart: If you’re looking for spare change, I already cleaned it out.// Raj: Well, didn’t think this is where my life would be.// Stuart: Me, either. I’m in a bedroom and you’re on a couch. I’m actually winning.// Raj: You know, we’re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.// Stuart: Okay, listen to me. There is no reason to leave here. This is great. Everyone’s nice. It’s comfortable. If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.// Raj: Wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?// Stuart: Better than I feel in their steam shower? I don’t think so.// Sheldon: Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard’s basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you’re dessert.// Amy: I want to say aw, but I’m gonna say ew.// Raj: No, you see, I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.// Stuart: Good for you. This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.// Raj: Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?// Stuart: Hey, look, I went to art college, I tried to make it as a graphic artist, a comic book artist, and you know what I got for my efforts? A visible rib cage. I’m not kidding. You could see my heart beating.// Raj: Well, no offence, but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics.// Stuart: Oh, great, it’ll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head.// Penny: Morning.// Leonard: Did you know Raj moved out last night?// Penny: What? Why?// Leonard: Leonard and Penny, I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused. I went to stay at Howard’s. PS Cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building.// Penny: I feel terrible.// Leonard: Should we go bring him back?// Penny: Well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems.// Leonard: Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. It’s like being possessed, but instead of Satan it’s, actually, it’s the same thing.// Penny: All right, so we’ll ask him to come back.// Leonard: Well, great.// Penny: Don’t you want to get dressed first?// Leonard: Just one second. Help, Cinnamon’s loose in the building.// Sheldon (off): Amy, quick, lock the door.// (off)// Penny: We’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really weren’t fighting about you.// Raj: I just never want to be a burden on my friends.// Stuart: Me, either. Don’t want to be a burden. Hey, is that the baby? I’ll go check.// Leonard: You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us.// Raj: But I also upset Sheldon, and he’s not gonna want to come over if I’m there.// Penny: More reasons for you to stay.// Stuart: Halley’s fine.// Bernadette: You know she’s at my parents’ house, right?// Stuart: And she’s having the time of her life.// Howard: If you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here.// Bernadette: Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.// Raj: I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone.// Penny: Then it’s settled.// Raj: And just so you know, it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable.// Bernadette: Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.// Stuart: Hey, that’s no way to talk about your baby.// Sheldon: You know what? I’m proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party.// Amy: Yup, we’re killin’ it.Series 10 Episode 19 – The Collaboration Fluctuation// Scene: The apartment.// Raj: You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana.// Penny: Oh, that’s beautiful. What does it mean?// Raj: Downward-facing dog.// Penny: Yeah, I guess they don’t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down.// Raj: Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there’s a word for it.// Leonard: I thought we were getting breakfast before work.// Penny: Oh, right, sorry.// Raj: It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.// Penny: If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.// Leonard: It’s cute that you think that. Don’t worry about it.// Raj: Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?// Leonard: Sure. You’re living here for free, I guess I owe you.// Raj: Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl.// Penny: Yeah, bye, sweetie.// Leonard: Bye.// Penny: Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.// Raj: Okay, and tree pose.// Leonard: Well, she’s done.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Amy’s car.// Sheldon: Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.// Amy: That’s great. How so?// Sheldon: Oh, the project is classified. I can’t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the (honks horn) I used the (honks horn) And then I (honks horn) And that did it. (Car passes honking horn) Wow, I wonder what they’re redacting.// (honks horn)// (Car passes honking horn)// Amy: Why don’t you ask me what I’m working on?// Sheldon: Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.// Amy: I’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.// Sheldon: So you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.// Amy: Yes, I’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place.// Sheldon: Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.// Amy: You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.// Howard: Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it.// Sheldon: Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?// Raj: The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food.// Leonard: He does raise an interesting point.// Sheldon: Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I’ll wait.// Leonard: I understand it, Sheldon.// Raj: Yeah, me, too.// Howard: I’m sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?// Raj: It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work.// Sheldon: Well, don’t get me wrong. Neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we’re going for a drive.// Raj: So did you confront Jennifer?// Penny: No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick.// Raj: Paul.// Penny: Paul.// Leonard: Who’s Paul?// Penny: Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He’s married to Nancy.// Leonard: Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?// Penny: I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.// Raj: Don’t worry, Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour.// Leonard: Jerry?// Raj: It didn’t work for Randy, it didn’t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer.// Penny: Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games.// Leonard: Tina?// Raj: With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.// Penny: Mm.// Leonard: I went to your office Christmas party?// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: You know, I like harp lessons, but I’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?// Sheldon: I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.// Amy: Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?// Sheldon: It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.// Amy: Sheldon, this is really interesting.// Sheldon: Yeah, and this one won’t stain my teeth purple.// Amy: You know, we’ve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?// Sheldon: That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.// Amy: Well, that would make me feel better.// Sheldon: All right, let’s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.// Amy: That’s a ridiculous rule.// Sheldon: Is it?// Penny: Okay, how is that?// Raj: I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.// Penny: Well, this is a moisturizing mask.// Raj: Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.// Penny: Hey, I hope you don’t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night.// Raj: I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.// Leonard: I’d still like to know who Jerry is.// Penny: Don’t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?// Leonard: That would be great. Thank you.// Raj: You want to go shopping?// Penny: Ooh, yes. Fun.// Leonard: Or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game.// Montage of shopping scenes.// Sheldon: I believe I’ve made some progress on our ground rules.// Amy: Oh, good. What are they?// Sheldon: Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,// my name goes first. Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first. I don’t want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off.// Amy: Can I see that?// Sheldon: Oh, of course. I’ll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper.// Amy: Sheldon, if we’re gonna have ground rules, I’ll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules.// Sheldon: I’d write that down, but I can’t now, can I?// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.// Leonard: I mean, they didn’t say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.// Howard: Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting.// Leonard: Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too.// Bernadette: Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.// Leonard: Oh, it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn’t that right, Halley?// Halley: (cries)// (cries)// Howard: Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s door.// Sheldon: Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thing’s gonna happen.// Amy: Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?// Sheldon: Fire away.// Amy: Number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition.// Sheldon: That’s smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0.// Amy: Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There’s no need to call an idea stupid.// Sheldon: Aw, someone drew a penis in it.// Amy: Are you listening?// Sheldon: I’m sorry, go ahead.// Amy: Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat.// Sheldon: Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we’re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.// Amy: Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?// Sheldon: Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be.// Montage of Sheldon and Amy working together.// Amy: Wow. Look at that.// Sheldon: Yes, this is remarkable.// Amy: So we’re agreed, it’s complete garbage.// Sheldon: By the way, your name can go first.// Scene: Inside a store.// Leonard: I mean, I’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable.// Bernadette: Well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?// Leonard: A little, until I saw them in matching tops.// Howard: Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.// Bernadette: Well, have you talked to them about it?// Leonard: Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?// Howard: This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.// Bernadette: Look, Raj just gets along with women.// Leonard: I know, but he was my friend first. It’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together.// Howard: You sure you don’t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.// Amy: I don’t know where we went wrong.// Sheldon: Yeah, the math is so inelegant. I’m not even sure it makes sense.// Amy: Well, don’t give up. Maybe we can fix it.// Sheldon: Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.// Amy: I can hear your face talking, so we’re even.// Sheldon: All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races.// Amy: Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I’ll blow it. Better?// Sheldon: No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that’s me. Never mind, it’s fine.// Amy: You know, you’re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea.// Sheldon: Hold on. I see what’s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex.// Amy: That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.// Sheldon: Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape.// Raj: Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?// Penny: I probably should have spit out my gum first.// Raj: Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.// Penny: Mm. Well, we’ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?// Raj: When did he leave?// Penny: Yeah, that’s rude.// Leonard: You know, it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera.// Bernadette: Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?// Leonard: Yeah.// Howard: You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don’t want to.// Bernadette: Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.// Howard: Wait. What? What do I make you do?// Bernadette: Let’s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector’s meet and greet.// Howard: It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. It’s not my fault you didn’t listen.// Leonard: I’m sure I’m overreacting.// Bernadette: You’re entitled to feel how you feel. If you don’t like it, you should just talk to her.// Leonard: I don’t want to sound like a jealous baby.// Bernadette: Oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her.// Amy: I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive.// Sheldon: Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I’m sensitive.// Amy: Hey, I wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.// Sheldon: That is a daring and insightful solution.// Amy: We’re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.// Sheldon: What if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?// Amy: I suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.// Sheldon: Well, if that’s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.// Amy: How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero.// Sheldon: It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.// Amy: There’s only one clear choice.// Sheldon: Science it is.// Amy: No, you bonehead.// Sheldon: Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I’m not the sharpest dresser.// Leonard: Anyway, I know it’s silly, but since Raj moved in, I’ve been feeling a little left out.// Penny: Well, sweetie, that’s crazy.// Raj: No, no, Penny, don’t dismiss his feelings.// Leonard: Thank you. I just feel…// Raj: Hang on, I’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. I just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place.// Leonard: Well, to be truthful…// Penny: Well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? I mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.// Raj: I don’t want to speak for Leonard.// Leonard: Thank you. I…// Raj: But when you’re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.// Penny: Yeah, you’re right. You know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff.// Raj: I’m a good listener.// Penny: Yeah.// Leonard: Hey, Olsen twins…// Penny: What?// Leonard: Well, I mean, I’m sitting right here. You’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.// Raj: I’m sorry. What did you want to say?// Leonard: I don’t know, you pretty much covered it.// Sheldon: Can you read them back?// Amy: Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition.// Sheldon: Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you’re going down, punk.// Amy: Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face.// Sheldon: I love that one.// Amy: Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas.// Sheldon: Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors.Series 10 Episode 20 – The Recollection Dissipation// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Hey, Leonard, if you’re not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work.// Leonard: Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project.// Penny: Oh, are you sure? We’re celebrating our new ADD drug, and it’ll probably be over in, like, six minutes.// Amy: Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?// Leonard: Yeah, why?// Amy: Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project.// Leonard: We’ve had this planned for a week.// Amy: Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.// Raj: Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon.// Penny: Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?// Raj: Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don’t answer. I’d love to.// Sheldon: Hello.// Amy: Why did you tell Leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?// Sheldon: Because I am.// Amy: But you said you were working with me.// Penny: Uh-oh. Someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom.// Sheldon: I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.// Leonard: I’m sorry, what is this plan you have?// Sheldon: Well, I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.// Leonard: When does that start?// Sheldon: Soon. See, I could’ve said in the near future, but I didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already.// Raj: Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldon’s a genius? But I didn’t.// Scene: The guys laboratory.// Sheldon: Gentlemen, I’ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?// Howard: Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?// Sheldon: These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry, I have lentil soup.// Leonard: It’s getting harder to pretend.// Howard: Anyway, Sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter.// Sheldon: Run down the pros and cons of each for me.// Howard: Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.// Sheldon: Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.// Howard: You can just feel the time being saved.// Scene: Amy’s laboratory// Sheldon: Ah, I’m back, you got me for eight minutes.// Amy: Sheldon, this is silly. You can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this.// Sheldon: The coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?// Scene: The guys laboratory// Howard: The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.// Leonard: It can’t be four revolutions, it’s got to be seven.// Howard: Seven? Look at the board, it’s four.// Leonard: Oh, my God, it’s seven.// Howard: Four.// –// Leonard: Seven.// Sheldon: It’s five and a half.// Howard: Son of a bitch, it’s five and a half.// Sheldon: BRB. That’s short for be right back. I’m saving so much time.// Scene: Amy’s laboratory.// Sheldon: The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.// Amy: Incredible. Sheldon, I didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong.// Sheldon: You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler, works.// Leonard: I got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once.// Sheldon: Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Stuart: Hey.// Bernadette: Hey.// Stuart: Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night.// Bernadette: No problem.// Stuart: Was just doing my taxes.// Bernadette: Okay.// Stuart: Actually, if I could, if I could just check one more…// Bernadette: Already cleared the browser history.// Stuart: You’re a good woman. What you working on?// Bernadette: Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.// Stuart: Oh, that’s right, maternity leave’s almost over. Ah, you excited?// Bernadette: Yeah, I mean, I’ll miss Halley, but it’ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.// Stuart: That’s great, good for you.// Bernadette: Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she’s gonna be fine.// Stuart: Ah, of course she is.// Bernadette: And that day care is great.// Stuart: It is. I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows.// Bernadette: Plus, I, I think I’m setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won’t know where I went or if I’m ever coming back. That’ll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special.// Stuart: Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don’t know what to do right now.// Bernadette: It’s okay, I’m just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?// Stuart: Well, don’t you think it’d be healthier if you told him what’s going on with you?// Bernadette: Don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?// Stuart: Your secret is safe with me.// Scene: The laundry room.// Penny: Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?// Sheldon: Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.// Penny: You know, there was a time I would say what’s a soup sack? But I’m glad we’re past that. (Sheldon sneezes) You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didn’t mean Thor? And then you would say Touché, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say// (Sheldon sneezes)// God bless you.// Sheldon: Well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?// Penny: Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day.// Sheldon: Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasn’t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.// Penny: Are you getting sick?// Sheldon: Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick.// Penny: Well, you’re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard.// Sheldon: I’m fine.// Penny: All right. Well, we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching Frozen.// Sheldon: That didn’t happen.// Penny: You also got a nosebleed watching Up.// Sheldon: Just do your laundry.// Bernadette: Stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner.// Stuart: Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning. And to be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.// Howard: Hey, what’s for dinner?// Bernadette: Meatloaf.// Howard: Oh, cool.// Bernadette: Stuart made it.// Howard: Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work.// Bernadette: Sounds great.// Howard: Speaking of which, for day care, it’ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it.// Bernadette: Hmm, guess it should be me.// Stuart: I can’t do it. They have a picture of me on file now.// Howard: You okay?// Bernadette: Of course, why?// Howard: Well, I don’t know, you seem a little upset.// Bernadette: No, I’m fine.// Howard: You sure?// Stuart: Why don’t you think she’s fine? She sounds fine, she looks fine. If I saw her on the street I’d say, damn, that girl’s fine.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: Sheldon, you’re sick, go back to bed.// Sheldon: I am fine. Here, eat your toast. (Sneezes) Sorry.// (Sneezes)// Amy: It’s okay, now I don’t need butter.// Sheldon: Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. It’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix.// Amy: You need sleep.// Sheldon: What I need is to get to work.// Amy: Well, I don’t want your germs around me.// Sheldon: What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?// Amy: Sheldon, are you okay?// Sheldon: What’s going on? How’d I get here?// Leonard: I don’t know, we came home from work and we found you.// Sheldon: Home from work? What time is it?// Penny: It’s nine o’clock.// Sheldon: Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?// Raj: Wait, you don’t remember?// Sheldon: Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine.// Leonard: You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.// Sheldon: At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?// Raj: I don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.// Sheldon: My pants are missing, I don’t remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?// Penny: I don’t know, check your body for tattoos?// Sheldon: Leonard, would you be a lamb?// Leonard: She’s kidding.// Sheldon: Wait, wait. Where’s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag.// Raj: It’s right here.// Sheldon: Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh, no.// Penny: Okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?// Sheldon: What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project.// Leonard: How could you lose that?// Amy: It’s okay, I’m sure we’ll find it.// Penny: Look, it’s got to be around here somewhere.// Amy: Maybe it’s wherever your pants are.// Raj: Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook.// Howard: Hey.// Stuart: Ah, hello.// Howard: Look, something’s going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?// Stuart: Well, nope, not a word.// Howard: Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?// Stuart: No, but I did mention it to my therapist.// Howard: Well, I know she’s mad at me about something.// Stuart: Well, what have you done that would upset her?// Howard: Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?// Stuart: Well, why don’t you just start with the worst thing?// Howard: Hmm, let’s see. Mm. Okay, here we go, six years ago, I got a call that Bernie’s great-aunt, Trixie, died.// Stuart: And?// Howard: And I forgot to give her the message.// Stuart: That’s terrible.// Howard: The terrible part is, ever since then, I’ve been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie.// Stuart: Oh Howard.// Howard: Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie’s purse.// Penny: The notebook isn’t in the bathroom.// Amy: I can’t find it, either. How can he not remember a day?// Penny: Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.// Leonard: Well, it’s not across the hall.// Sheldon: That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.// Raj: You’re not going to prison.// Leonard: But, boy, it is funny to think about.// Amy: You really can’t remember anything?// Sheldon: I’m trying.// Raj: Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.// Sheldon: Why?// Raj: Well, it’s, it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went.// Amy: Phones can do that?// Raj: Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.// Penny: Oh, that, that’s so cool. How do you, how do you turn that thing off?// Leonard: Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut.// Penny: I don’t even run there, I drive.// Raj: Hang on, I can see every place you went.// Sheldon: What does it say?// Raj: Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.// Sheldon: Where?// Raj: Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?// Sheldon: I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe.// Howard: Hey, how’s it going?// Bernadette: Fine.// Howard: Good. Love you.// Bernadette: Love you, too.// Howard: Love you more.// Bernadette: Okay, you won. Can I finish what I’m doing?// Howard: Sure, sorry.// Bernadette: Something on your mind?// Howard: No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe I’m just feeling like something’s bothering you.// Bernadette: Nope, all good.// Howard: Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.// Bernadette: No, what is wrong with you?// Howard: Aha, you are upset. I don’t know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.// Bernadette: Howard, I’m sorry if I’m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you.// Howard: It doesn’t?// Bernadette: No. I didn’t want to tell you, but I’m having a really tough time about going back to work.// Howard: Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back.// Bernadette: It was?// Howard: Of course. I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day.// Bernadette: I just don’t know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I’m abandoning Halley. If I don’t go, I’m giving up everything I worked for. It’s like there’s no right choice.// Howard: Look, I don’t know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it.// Bernadette: I guess.// Howard: And the best part is Halley won’t remember a thing. Babies are cute, but they’re dumb. I mean, I go like this, she thinks I’m gone, then magically I’m back. I mean honestly, why are we saving for college?// Bernadette: I’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.// Howard; Well, she gets it from me. Speaking of which, I have some news about your Aunt Trixie.// Scene: A cowboy bar.// Raj: Does this place look familiar?// Sheldon: It’s hard to say.// Barman: Hey, Sheldon’s back.// Bar patrons: Sheldon!// Sheldon: It’s getting clearer.// Barman: You gonna buy another round for the house?// Sheldon: Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.// Leonard: Ask him.// Sheldon: Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?// Raj: These here parts?// Sheldon: It’s called fitting in. By the way, good luck.// Barman: Here you go.// Sheldon: Oh, thank goodness.// Barman: One top secret quantum guidance system.// Leonard: You understood the math?// Barman: No, but Sheldon told me all about it. He told everybody.// Leonard: That’s just great.// Barman: Oh, don’t worry, he made us pinky swear we’d keep it a secret.// Flashback// Sheldon: I swear.// Everyone: I swear:// Sheldon: Not to tell anyone.// Everyone: Not to tell anyone.// Sheldon: The top secret military information I’m about to tell you.// Everyone: The top secret military information I’m about to tell you.// End of flashback// Sheldon: We really need to skedaddle. Thank you.// Raj: Bye.// Barman: See you. Should probably erase this.// Sheldon: Thank you for making me tea.// Amy: You’re welcome. How is it?// Sheldon: Yummy. And warm on my back.// Amy: Do you need anything else?// Sheldon: You know exactly what I need.// Amy: Fine. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.// Sheldon: That’s nice. Now in German.// Amy: Weiches Kätzchen, warmes Kätzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. Liebes Kätzchen, müdes Kätzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt.// Sheldon: Great. Now Mandarin.// Amy: Sings in Mandarin. *// Sings in Mandarin. *// Sheldon: Now Navajo.// * (I have been unable to find a proper transcription of the Mandarin lyrics. If anyone who speaks Mandarin is able to send me a full transcription, I will include the lyrics here.)Series 10 Episode 21 – The Separation Agitation// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: All right, we’re about to go live, everyone on their A-game, good energy. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.// Amy: And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.// Sheldon: And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we’re calling…// Together: Fun with Flags: Behind the Flags: A Retrospective.// Howard (singing): Wondering how it all began?// (singing)// Raj (singing): You’ll need a good attention span.// Howard (singing): For information and entertainment.// Raj (singing): That’s equally effective.// Together (singing): It’s fun with flags, behind the flags, a retrospective. Flags.// Sheldon: Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don’t literally mean these flags. That’s just where we have dinner.// Amy: Now, I’m sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.// Sheldon: So let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds.// Amy: Could have played that on my harp.// Sheldon: Just roll the clip. (On voiceover) So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.// (On voiceover) So// Leonard: I honestly don’t remember.// Sheldon: Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…// Penny: Oh, wait. I remember.// Sheldon: Oh, and do you remember what you said?// Penny: Yes. Please find someone who cares.// Sheldon: And that’s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.// Amy: Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.// Sheldon: And now we’re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments.// Amy: And don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying. (Long pause) Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags.// (Long pause)// Bert: Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It’s Bert.// Sheldon: Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?// Bert: I have a girlfriend.// Amy: And what does that have to do with flags?// Bert: Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.// Sheldon: Bert, you’re tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.// Amy: Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller.// Bert: Her name’s Rebecca.// Credits sequence.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s van.// Howard: Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? Oh, Howie, I don’t need food as long as I can look at my phone.// Bernadette: I don’t like when you imitate me.// Howard: You want to hear my Stuart? It’s been a while since I’ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?// Stuart: I said that to you in confidence.// Howard: This is supposed to be our family fun day. What’s so important on your phone?// Bernadette: I’m on the day care’s website.// Howard: Stop looking at that. The day care’s great. It’s on campus. My office is two minutes away. There’s nothing to worry about.// Bernadette: What if she likes the people who work there more than us?// Howard: She already likes soap bubbles more than us.// Bernadette: When I go back to work, we’re gonna leave her with these people. We don’t know anything about them.// Howard: They’re highly-trained educators with background checks. They’re even required to be current on all vaccinations.// Stuart: You leave her with me, and I’m not any of those things.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Sheldon: Where’s Howard?// Raj: He took the day off.// Sheldon: Oh, let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I’ll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I don’t know where I am.// Leonard: So Howard back Monday?// Raj: Yeah.// Bert: Hey, guys.// Sheldon: Oh, hello.// Leonard: Hey. Want to join us?// Sheldon: Ah-ah-ah, he’s a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.// Raj: Oh, quick, sit.// Leonard: So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.// Sheldon: Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.// Bert: Sorry. I couldn’t help myself. I guess I just love love.// Raj: Well, I’m very happy for you.// Leonard: Hey, we’re all having dinner tonight. Why don’t the two of you join us?// Sheldon: Hold on. We don’t know anything about this woman.// Bert: What do you want to know?// Sheldon: Is she a geologist?// Bert: No.// Sheldon: Oh great, see you at seven.// Scene: The Zoo.// Howard: How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?// Stuart: Not a good idea. My hair is a coveted nesting material.// Howard: Learning anything?// Bernadette: Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. I’m going back to work after only four months, so I’ve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.// Howard: Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.// Bernadette: It’s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.// Stuart: Told you we should have gone to Legoland.// Scene: The apartment.// Raj: Can’t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don’t.// Amy: I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.// Raj: Oh, grow up.// Leonard: Don’t you have any friends he can date?// Penny: Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life.// Raj: Oh, hey, guys. Come in.// Bert: Thanks. Everyone, this is Rebecca.// Rebecca: Hi.// Leonard: Hey.// Sheldon: She’s younger and far more attractive than he is. They’re copying you two.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: What are you making?// Stuart: Chicken. Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.// Howard: Finally get Halley down?// Bernadette: Yeah, eventually. She’s still not happy about taking a bottle, though.// Howard: Look, if you’re not ready to go back to work, we’ll figure something out.// Bernadette: No, I’ll be fine.// Stuart: It might be good for her. Howard’s mother was around him all the time, and he’s a world-class mama’s boy.// Howard: I mean, why would you say that?// Stuart: Go ahead, have a tantrum, that’ll prove me wrong.// Bernadette: It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.// Howard: I guess. It wasn’t until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.// Stuart: On that charming note, dinner is served.// Penny: So is this your first time dating a scientist? ‘Cause I’m thinking of starting a support group.// Rebecca: Actually, I’m not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist.// Sheldon: Bert, Rebecca. I’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.// Rebecca: Don’t worry about it. It’s fine.// Sheldon: See? It was fine. I didn’t need a time-out.// Amy: It wasn’t a time-out. Let’s get some food.// Sheldon: You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.// Amy: Get your food.// Raj: So how did you two meet?// Rebecca: Oh, it’s such a cute story. We met on a dating Web site.// Leonard: Is that it?// Rebecca: Oh, sorry. The end.// Raj: That’s nice. I haven’t had much success meeting people online.// Bert: I didn’t either, until I revamped my profile.// Sheldon: What’d you do, delete your photo?// Amy: Go.// Sheldon: Fine.// Amy: And don’t you slam that door.// Sheldon: Aw, man.// Rebecca: Did I say something wrong?// Leonard: No, it’s always him.// Penny: , Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?// Bert: Right. I wasn’t getting any responses, and then I added recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner, and five minutes later I met my soul mate.// Amy: I was wrong. You can come back in.// Leonard: So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?// Rebecca: I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn’t really work out.// Sheldon: I’d say she’s copying you again, but I’m getting tired of sitting in the hall.// Raj: I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.// Rebecca: I could give you some free sessions.// Penny: Oh, is that offer for everybody?// Leonard: Nice try. I’m not going.// Rebecca: Where’s your bathroom?// Leonard: Mm, just down there.// Bert: She’s so perfect, sometimes I think she isn’t real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.// Penny: Aw, that’s so weird.// Amy: I’m sorry, Bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?// Bert: She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.// Sheldon: Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?// Penny: You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.// Leonard: And we lived happily ever after.// Penny: The end.// Bernadette: Well, guess I’m ready to go.// Howard: Have a great first day back.// Bernadette: You have everything she needs for day care?// Stuart: Yep, all in the bag.// Bernadette: Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.// Howard: I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out.// Stuart: Bye, cutie. I’m gonna miss you. I’m gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.// Bernadette: Stop, you’re gonna make me cry.// Howard: Great, now everybody’s crying.// Stuart: At least Halley’s not.// Howard: That’s good.// Bernadette: She’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care.// Sheldon: Who’s ready to laugh?// Leonard: O-o-o-o-oh.// Sheldon: Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears// we’re inside a joke. Einstein replies, but only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously. To which Schrodinger says, if someone’s looking in the window, I’m leaving.// Leonard: That’s actually funny.// Raj: You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.// Bert: Hey.// Leonard: Oh, hello. Join us.// Raj: Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.// Bert: Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn’t flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca.// Leonard: Wow, that’s a big step.// Raj: I think it shows a lot of character.// Bert: I’m gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.// Sheldon: That’s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.// Scene: The daycare.// Bernadette (on phone): How’s she doing?// (on phone)// Howard: She’s great. Look.// Bernadette: I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is.// Howard: See? Nothing to worry about.// Bernadette: Thank you. Okay, I’m gonna try and get some work done.// Howard: Yeah, me, too. Love you.// Bernadette: Love you, too. Bye.// Stuart: How is she?// Howard: What are you doing here?// Stuart: Can’t a guy hang out at a college he doesn’t go to and stare at a baby that isn’t his?// Howard: I get it. I haven’t even made it to my office yet.// Stuart: Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?// Howard: Probably. We should go.// Stuart: Yeah. Or we could take her to the aquarium.// Howard: I’ll get her, you grab her bag.// Stuart: Hang on, Halley, we’re busting you out of there.// Amy: What are you looking at?// Sheldon: Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet.// Bert: Hello? Anybody home?// Leonard: Is that Bert?// Bert: It’s Bert.// Penny: I think it’s Bert.// Raj: Hey, what’s up?// Bert: I broke up with Rebecca.// Penny: Oh.// Amy: Oh. You know, good for you.// Bert: No, I miss her. I don’t know why I listened to you.// Sheldon: He’s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.// Amy: You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now.// Penny: Bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money.// Bert: She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one doing that is me.// Leonard: If you’re that upset, go get her back.// Bert: I tried. She’s not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone. I made a huge mistake.// Raj: No, you didn’t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.// Penny: Look, sweetie, relationships aren’t about money, okay? It’s about respect and having things in common and… yes, Sheldon?// Sheldon: You and Leonard don’t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.// Leonard: You called on him.// Stuart: Guess who’s home from day care?// Howard: It’s Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid’s foot.// Bernadette: You realize they called when you took her.// Howard: Guess who’s home from the aquarium?// Bert: Sorry again for barging in.// Leonard: You don’t have to go. You’re welcome to hang with us.// Sheldon: Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. Unless it’s Raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour.// Bert: You guys are nice, but I’m just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.// Raj: I feel bad for Bert.// Sheldon: So he’s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?// Leonard: It’s totally different. Bert’s money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.// Penny: All that and he’s shorter than me.// Raj: Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?// Sheldon: Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body.// Raj: Really?// Amy: Relax. We’re the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.// Howard: She does look happy.// Bernadette: See? This is the right thing for her. Let’s all just go to work.// Stuart: Any time.// Bernadette: Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go.// Sheldon: Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.// Sheldon: Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together.// Amy: So welcome to tonight’s episode,// Together: Fun with Flags: Behind the Behind the Flags: A Retrospective Retrospective.// Sheldon: Ooh, we already have our first call.// Amy: Oh. Hello, you’re on Fun with Flags.// Bert: The Jet Ski worked. I got her back.Series 10 Episode 22 – The Cognition Regeneration// Scene: The apartment.// Leonard: We’re pinned down.// Howard: We can’t get through.// Raj: Sheldon, get over here and help.// Sheldon: Okay, one second.// Leonard: Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?// Sheldon: I’m trying to shoot.// Howard: Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button.// Leonard: Aw.// Raj: That’s it, we’re dead.// Howard: Okay, challenge them again.// Leonard: Doing it right now. Oh, they can’t. There’s an important Little League game tomorrow.// Howard: No wonder they beat us, they’re jocks.// Sheldon: What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.// Howard: Kids are always better at video games.// Sheldon: Well, I don’t like it.// Leonard: Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.// Sheldon: No, but it’s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.// Howard: Oh, so our love is not real?// Raj: Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.// Sheldon: I guess I just need to face it, I’m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what’s for lunch.// Leonard: Hot dogs.// Sheldon: Yay.// Credits sequence.// Scene: A bar.// Penny: I didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.// Bernadette: Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.// Amy: I’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check.// Bernadette: Ruin it for me and I’ll break this glass over your head.// Amy: To denial.// Penny: Ooh. I’m gonna get another. You want food?// Bernadette: Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone.// Zack: Penny?// Penny: Oh, Zack. Hey.// Zack: What are the odds of running into you here?// Penny: Well, it’s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what’s new?// Zack: Oh, tons of stuff. Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.// Penny: Well, congratulations.// Zack: That’s what my dermatologist said.// Penny: No, on, on getting engaged, good for you.// Zack: Oh, thanks. How about you? Hey, how’s Leonard? Is he still smart?// Penny: Yes, yes, he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he’s not even here.// Zack: I love that little guy. Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.// Penny: Uh, yeah, sure, I’ll check with Leonard.// Zack: Cool, I’ll check with Sara. Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me.// Scene: The comic book store.// Sheldon: I’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.// Leonard: You’re gonna have to be more specific.// Sheldon: At the hands of those teenagers.// Leonard: More.// Sheldon: Boy teenagers.// Leonard: Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.// Sheldon: I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging.// Raj: You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?// Howard: Now, this is rare. I don’t know which one of you I want to stop talking first.// Sheldon: The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.// Raj: Like J-Lo’s hair.// Howard: Boy, it is neck and neck right now.// Leonard: How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?// Sheldon: Well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.// Leonard: I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk.// Raj: If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.// Sheldon: Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha. (I did that when I was eight)// Raj: Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi.// Penny: Hey, you ready to go?// Leonard: Yeah, I guess.// Penny: What’s the matter?// Leonard: Honestly? It’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about.// Penny: What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it.// Leonard: It’ll be fine, let’s just go.// Penny: Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.// Leonard: Aaargh.// Penny: Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.// Leonard: Ha, I knew you weren’t asleep.// Scene: A restaurant.// Zack: Hey, guys.// Penny: Hi. Hey, where’s your fiancée?// Zack: Oh, she couldn’t make it. She had an emergency.// Penny: Oh, no, what happened?// Zack: I didn’t ask.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: Hey.// Sheldon: Hey.// Raj: Hey.// Amy: What smells so good?// Sheldon: Raj is teaching me to make croissants.// Amy: Is this part of your super-aging?// Sheldon: Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.// Raj: Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.// Sheldon: Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can’t I do?// Amy: Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.// Sheldon: For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.// Raj: You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these.// Sheldon: You’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.// Raj: Damn it, he’s good at that, too.// Scene: The restaurant.// Zack: Thanks. Wow, working on a top secret government project, that is so cool. Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?// Leonard: I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.// Zack: I miss that guy. He’s like the Swedish Chef Muppet. I don’t know what he’s saying, but he’s funny.// Leonard: Oh, I know what he’s saying, and he’s not, he’s not funny.// Zack: So, Penny, what’s going on with you? How’s the job?// Penny: Uh, it’s okay, I’m still in pharmaceutical sales.// Leonard: She’s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success.// Penny: Yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I’m not crazy about a lot of it.// Zack: Hey, if you’re not happy there, I’ve been looking for a new head of sales at my company. And we don’t sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you’ll be telling is we print on recycled paper. We don’t.// Penny: Oh, that’s a nice offer.// Zack: You know, we’d make a great team. Or as we say in the menu business, I can’t do this without Me N U.// Penny: Right, ’cause it spells menu.// Zack: Yeah, right? It’s funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that’s my favourite.// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.// Howard: All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?// Sheldon: It really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging.// Howard: Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic.// Sheldon: Howard, I’m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.// Bernadette: So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?// Howard: Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?// Bernadette: Yes, I’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.// Howard: And it’s hard, isn’t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?// Sheldon: Okay, I think I got that.// Howard: Uh, hold on. There’s an old saying in juggling.// Bernadette: Is it I’m going to die alone?// Howard: No, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.// Sheldon: Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?// Howard: No.// Sheldon: Are you sure? ‘Cause I’m feeling a twinge.// Scene: Penny’s car.// Penny: See, that wasn’t so bad. He even picked up the check.// Leonard: Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I’m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You’re not really considering working for him, are you?// Penny: Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.// Leonard: Don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?// Penny: You work with Sheldon, you tell me.// Leonard: Yeah, it’s weird.// Penny: Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?// Leonard: No, no, I’m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers.// Penny: Great, so you want me to stay at a job I’m not happy at?// Leonard: Uh.// Penny: You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.// Leonard: Of course I don’t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. You don’t have to stop, just slow down, I’ll jump out.// Sheldon: Amy, look, I’m on a unicycle!// Amy: How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?// Sheldon: I hurt myself juggling.// Amy: Where did you get it?// Sheldon: Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.// Amy: Have you tried letting go of the rope?// Sheldon: What, are you crazy? I’m on a unicycle.// Amy: All right, well, have fun.// Sheldon: Wait, I need help getting down.// Amy: Well, what do you want me to do?// Sheldon: Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.// Howard: So you told her she was being dumb?// Leonard: No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb.// Raj: Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?// Leonard: We covered this, I’m dumb.// Penny: So he’s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can’t believe Leonard would be so insecure.// Bernadette: Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.// Penny: And Zack’s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.// Bernadette: We’re talking about the same Leonard, right?// Leonard: So you think it’s fine if she works for Zack?// Howard: I don’t know, maybe.// Raj: Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.// Howard: Yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.// Leonard: Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.// Howard: Again.// Bernadette: I would never let Howard work with an ex.// Penny: What, you wouldn’t trust him?// Bernadette: I wouldn’t trust her. He’s thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.// Penny: Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog.// Bernadette: And I’d like to think Howie wouldn’t take a job I was uncomfortable with.// Penny: ‘Cause he’s scared of you?// Bernadette: Terrified.// Penny: Yeah.// Howard: You know what? I’m with Leonard, this isn’t cool.// Leonard: Thank you.// Raj: I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she’ll push back.// Leonard: So you think it’s okay?// Raj: Oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.// Amy: What are you doing?// Sheldon: I’m returning this stuff to Howard.// Amy: Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?// Sheldon: Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb.// Amy: You said juggling was dumb, too.// Sheldon: Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I’d wear cargo pants.// Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?// Sheldon: Are you calling me a quitter?// Amy: Well, if you honestly…// Sheldon: This conversation is over.// Amy: His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me.// Penny: Hey.// Leonard: Hi.// Penny: You want to talk?// Leonard: That doesn’t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?// Penny: Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex, and I don’t like it now.// Leonard: Yeah, sorry.// Penny: Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.// Leonard: Well, thanks. And I don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like.// Penny: Then what do we do?// Leonard: Well, I don’t love it, but if you really want to take this job, I’ll find a way to deal with it.// Penny: No, I know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now.// Leonard: No, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, I’ll just, I’ll suck it up.// Penny: You don’t need to do that, it’s okay.// Leonard: Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.// Amy: I made you tea.// Sheldon: Thank you.// Amy: I’m sorry I called you a quitter.// Sheldon: It’s okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me.// Amy: What are you reading?// Sheldon: This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.// Amy: So?// Sheldon: So I’m running out of time.// Amy: That’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you.// Sheldon: Oh, you have to say that, you’re sweet on me.// Amy: Well, if you’re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.// Sheldon: Hey, I thought you were sweet on me.// Amy: Okay, fine, let’s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?// Sheldon: You’re so cute. I’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.// Amy: So many warnings.// Penny: Okay, are you sure about this?// Leonard: Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I’m being.// Zack (on phone): Penny, what’s up?// (on phone)// Penny: Hey, uh, so I’ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job.// Zack: Oh, bad news. When my fiancée found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me.// Penny: Oh, so there’s no job?// Zack: Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.// Penny: Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren’t you gonna say anything?// Leonard: Not if I want to be doing this later.// Bernadette: Hey, I didn’t know you were home. Where you been?// Howard: I went to see your mom.// Bernadette: Seriously, where were you?// Howard: I just told you, your mom’s.// Bernadette: Why?// Howard: Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid.// Bernadette: Oh. What’d she say?// Howard: She didn’t say much of anything. But she said a lot. (Through ventriloquist’s doll) Hi, Bernadette, remember me?// (Through ventriloquist’s doll)// Bernadette: First of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from South Carolina.// Howard: I can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.// Bernadette: Okay, it’s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant.// Howard: Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.// Bernadette: No. And the little lady has a name.// Howard: Which is?// Bernadette: Tammy Jo St. Cloud.// Howard: Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I’m a dork for juggling.// Bernadette: Sorry, you’re not a dork. (Through doll) You’re a clown. (Bernadette) Tammy Jo, don’t say that, you’ll make him feel bad. (Doll) Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?// (Through doll)// (Bernadette)// (Doll)// Howard: All right, very funny.// Bernadette: Don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years. (Doll) Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.// Howard: That’s enough, put her away.// Bernadette (as Doll): Oh, big daddy, I don’t think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now.// (as Doll)// Howard: All right, you’re freaking me out.// Bernadette (as Doll): Don’t be that way. If you don’t mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. Ooh.// Scene: A street.// Sheldon: I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m tall and I’m doing it. (Waking up in bed) Ah, man.// (Waking up in bed)Series 10 Episode 23 – The Gyroscopic Collapse// After a “previously on” segment.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Champagne, champagne.// Leonard: Thank you.// Penny: And for the world’s tallest second grader, apple juice.// Sheldon: Thank you. No bendy straw, some party.// Leonard: Hey, a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers.// All: Cheers.// Amy: You know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.// Bernadette: Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.// Raj: Without me.// Sheldon: To success without Raj.// Bernadette: So what happens next?// Howard: Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.// Sheldon: Yeah, I’ll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C.// Leonard: First thing tomorrow morning, we’re back at it.// Sheldon: I hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer.// Scene: Outside the lab.// Computer Voice: Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted.// Leonard: Hmm. I don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. Now, before we field test, I think we…// Howard: What the hell?// Leonard: Where is everything?// Sheldon: Who else has access to this room?// Leonard: It’s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us.// Sheldon: This is disconcerting.// Howard: But the movie did just get good.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The laboratory .// Leonard: Sir, I, I, I’m sorry but I just don’t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?// Col. Williams: Sounds like you get it.// Howard: But why would you do that?// Col. Williams: You guys completed phase one, we’ll take it from here.// Sheldon: Where did you move it?// Col. Williams: I can’t tell you that.// Leonard: Are you implementing phase two?// Sheldon: Wait, so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?// Col: Williams: That one I can tell you, yes.// Howard: This is all very upsetting.// Col. Williams: I’m sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is people’s feelings.// Sheldon: If that’s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.// Raj: I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.// Penny: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.// Raj: Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.// Penny: Um, well, I, yeah, you got me.// Amy: Where are you moving?// Penny: And when? But also where?// Raj: Bert has a room for rent.// Bernadette: So you’re gonna be roommates with Bert?// Raj: Uh, no, it’s, uh, pretty private, actually, it’s over his garage. So the only time I’ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.// Amy: Well, good for you. I actually have a little news myself.// Penny: Okay, we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out? Okay, that’s cool.// Amy: I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton.// Bernadette: Hey, that’s amazing.// Penny: Good for you.// Raj: Congratulations.// Amy: Thanks, but the thing is I’ll be gone for a few months and I don’t know how Sheldon’s gonna feel about that.// Penny: Oh, come on, he’s a grown man, he can take care of himself.// Amy: You really believe that?// Penny: Once again, you got me.// Scene: The stairwell.// Howard: How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?// Leonard: I can’t believe the Air Force would treat us like that.// Sheldon: You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives.// Leonard: Third floor, wrong apartment.// Howard: Although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be Penny.// Leonard: She might disappear, but she’s definitely not cleaning anything.// Sheldon: It’s okay, everything’s here.// Penny: Oh, hey, what’s going on?// Leonard: You won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project.// Penny: What?// Bernadette: You’re kidding. Why would they do that?// Howard: They wouldn’t say.// Sheldon: I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he’s the other kind.// Amy: Sheldon, I’m so sorry.// Sheldon: Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?// Leonard: Yeah, what’s going on with you guys?// Howard: Give us some good news.// Penny: Amy’s got some news.// Amy: Yeah, um, Raj is moving out.// Leonard: Oh, no. When?// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s van.// Bernadette: You doing okay?// Howard: Not really.// Bernadette: Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.// Howard: No. Then you’ll get all sexed up and I’m not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted.// Bernadette: You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.// Howard: Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.// Bernadette: Really? That’s the importance you put on us having a baby?// Howard: I’m happy about it, but, I mean, it’s not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you.// Penny (on phone): So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?// (on phone)// Amy: No, I’m waiting till he’s in a good mood.// Penny: Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.// Amy: I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t go.// Penny: Oh, stop it, he’ll be fine.// Amy: I guess. And he’ll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.// Penny; Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn’t go.// Amy: Got to go. Morning.// Sheldon: I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.// Amy: Are you feeling okay?// Sheldon: Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.// Amy: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.// Sheldon: No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.// Amy: Oh, the more details, the more sorry. Well, maybe this’ll cheer you up. I made your favorite oatmeal, plain.// Sheldon: What’s the occasion?// Amy: No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you.// Sheldon: You’re so kind. You know, I don’t know how I ever got by without you.// Amy: Oh. That’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own.// Sheldon: Well, I thought that, too, but I’ve come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.// Amy: Sheldon, you’re, you’re being silly.// Sheldon: No, to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?// Amy: You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new.// Sheldon: Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that.// Amy: Oh, I don’t know, I mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks.// Sheldon: I’m confused. You’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.// Amy: That is true, I have said that.// Sheldon: Well, a lot, it’s very annoying. Has something changed? Um, is there something that you’re not telling me?// Amy: I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.// Sheldon: Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill.// Amy: Yeah, that’s the one.// Sheldon: Well, that’s wonderful. Congratulations.// Amy: Well, I haven’t accepted it yet. I wanted to talk to you first.// Sheldon: What is there to talk about? You have to take it. It’s important.// Amy: So are you.// Sheldon: Thank you, but I’ll be fine.// Amy: Are, are you sure?// Sheldon: Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too.// Scene: A park.// Bernadette: Really? He doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?// Amy: I don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.// Penny: I mean, I like a little brown sugar.// Amy: Guys.// Penny: Sorry.// Bernadette: You’re still gonna go, right?// Amy: I don’t know. Sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.// Penny: Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he’d be on the first train to New Jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.// Bernadette: Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram.// Penny: Well, what’s wrong with that?// Bernadette: No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage.// Penny: And yet you bore his child. Neato.// Bernadette: You’re excited about this opportunity, right?// Amy: Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…// Penny: Okay, a simple yes will do.// Bernadette: You have to go.// Amy: I know, but what if Sheldon…// Penny: Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It’s not like you two are very physical.// Amy: Hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors.// Penny: A lot of lectures?// Amy: All right, so you know.// Bernadette: I’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it.// Howard: Hey, wait up.// Bernadette: Oh, great.// Howard: You left something at home. A big hug.// Bernadette: Oh.// Howard: I found it right next to these kisses.// Bernadette: It’s too late for me. Save yourself.// Leonard: So, are you excited to have your own place again?// Raj: I am, but I’ll miss you guys.// Leonard: Ah, we’ll miss you, too.// Raj: You could try saying that without smiling.// Leonard: I’m trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?// Sheldon: What does it look like? I’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.// Raj: Why?// Sheldon: I got the blues. My baby done left me.// Raj: Come on, Sheldon. Amy’s only gone for a few months. And now that I’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want.// Leonard: Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?// Raj: Yeah, sure.// Leonard: Sheldon, you’re being silly.// Sheldon: Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall.// Leonard: Do you really care about that last one?// Sheldon: No, but that list was sounding a little thin.// Leonard: Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend.// Sheldon: So trick her.// Leonard: All right, let me start again. Uh, you and Amy…// Raj (outside): Can I get my stuff? Sounds like it’s gonna be a while.// (outside)// Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.// Howard: I missed you.// Bernadette: Come here, let’s talk.// Howard: Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking ’cause you know.// Bernadette: Just listen. I don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.// Howard: Oh.// Bernadette: A little clingy.// Howard: I know and I’m sorry.// Bernadette: Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.// Howard: Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?// Bernadette: I signed us up for ballroom dance class.// Howard: Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?// Bernadette: I made us have a baby.// Howard: So?// Bernadette: Bring it in.// Howard: And now the movie just got rated R.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Amy: Hey. You going somewhere?// Sheldon: No, but you are, so I got you this as a present.// Amy: Sheldon, that isn’t necessary.// Sheldon: No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me that I’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage.// Amy: Thank you.// Sheldon: The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it.// Amy: Does this mean you’re okay with me going?// Sheldon: Well, I’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. Uh, I know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…// Amy: I am.// Sheldon: Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, I’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.// Amy: I wasn’t thinking that.// Sheldon: Well, no, it’s just, I’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I can’t Skype it to you.// Amy: That’s a risk I’m willing to take.// Sheldon: All right, then. Let’s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking.// Amy: What if we don’t fold our clothes at all?// Sheldon: Or, what if we fold them?// Scene: The apartment doorway.// Raj: Well, here’s your key back.// Raj: As soon as I have the place set up I’m gonna have you guys over.// Penny: Oh, we would love that.// Raj: I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life.// Sheldon (off): Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen.// (off)// Raj: Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends// like you…// Amy (off): My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient.// (off):// Raj: I can’t compete with that. Bye.// Leonard: Should we give them their privacy?// Penny: I want to, but I don’t think I can.// Sheldon (off): Whoopee!// Penny: Okay, I’m good now.// Amy: Okay, the car is waiting. Do you want to walk me downstairs?// Sheldon: Of course. Here, here, let me. I’ve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod.// Amy: Is it?// Sheldon: Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve.// Amy: Do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?// Sheldon: It’s hard to say. I’ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?// Amy: I’ll love you no matter what.// Sheldon: Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.// Amy: We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.// Sheldon: And you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport?// Amy: I will.// Sheldon: And when you’re at the gate?// Amy: Uh-huh.// Sheldon: And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?// Amy: I don’t know what they look like, but sure.// Sheldon: And don’t forget to Skype me when you arrive.// Amy: I won’t.// Sheldon: And every morning.// Amy: Got it.// Sheldon: Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello.// Amy: Good thinking.// Sheldon: And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do.// Amy: Thank you. That means a lot.// Sheldon: Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately.Series 10 Episode 24 – The Long Distance Dissonance// Following a “previously on” sequence.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy on skype.// Sheldon: How are you settling in?// Amy: Pretty well. Princeton has a beautiful campus.// Sheldon: Now, I’ve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They’re both shocking.// Amy: Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?// Sheldon: Well, I’m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, I’ll tell you that.// Amy: I miss you.// Sheldon: I miss you, too.// Amy: It’s so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar.// Sheldon: I’m sorry you had to go through that.// Amy: In fact, that’s when I started to really miss you.// Sheldon: You know you just split an infinitive.// Amy: Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?// Sheldon: I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.// Amy: What are you gonna do about it?// Sheldon: I’m going to admonish you.// Amy: Vigorously?// Sheldon: That’s the only kind of admonishing I do.// Credits sequence.// Scene: The cafeteria.// Howard: How’s Sheldon doing with Amy gone?// Leonard: Well, the last three nights I’ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. Now ask me how I’m doing with Amy gone.// Raj: How are you doing with…// Leonard: Shut up.// Howard: If you’d like, we can help you out.// Leonard: Oh, that would be great.// Howard: I mean, not me, I’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.// Raj: It was a tutorial. And yes, I’m happy to keep Sheldon company.// Leonard: Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.// Raj: Oh, why does he need a ladder?// Leonard: He doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.// Sheldon: Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki, She’s back at Caltech for her postdoc.// Ramona Nowitzki: Hello.// Leonard: Hello.// Raj: Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you.// Sheldon: Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.// Leonard: Oh. I love those.// Sheldon: Let’s sit somewhere else.// Raj: What just happened?// Howard: A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.// Leonard: Wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?// Howard: Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.// Raj: So what do you guys think that’s about?// Leonard: Knowing Sheldon, nothing.// Sheldon: So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.// Ramona: Not ’til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory.// Sheldon: Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.// Leonard: He just made her laugh, something’s wrong.// Raj: Do you see the way she’s looking at him?// Howard: Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.// Raj: I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.// Leonard: Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?// Howard: Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.// Raj: Which is?// Howard: That ain’t Sheldon.// Scene: The apartment.// Penny: Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh.// Bernadette: That’s nothing, Howie said she touched his hand.// Penny: Did he Purell?// Bernadette: No.// Penny: I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.// Bernadette: Should we call Amy?// Penny: I don’t know; we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing.// Bernadette: I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.// Penny: Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon’s sexual appetite?// Bernadette: Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?// Penny: All right, then we agree. He’s not making any moves, it’s this Dr. Ramona chick.// Bernadette: Nowitzki. I googled her, she’s pretty cute.// Penny: Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.// Sheldon: And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.// Amy: Sounds like a big night.// Sheldon: Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?// Amy: So you’re keeping busy? You’re not lonely?// Sheldon: Oh, not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch// with Dr. Nowitzki.// Amy: Who’s he?// Sheldon: Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.// Amy: Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?// Sheldon: Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at Caltech.// Amy: Huge fan, you say?// Sheldon: Yes. I think you’d like her. She’s extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer.// Amy: That’s terrific. I’ll call you right back.// Penny (answering skype): Oh, hey, Amy.// (answering skype)// Amy: I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?// Penny: We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.// Bernadette: Which he only did once.// Amy: Why didn’t you tell me?// Bernadette: We didn’t want you to worry.// Amy: Should I worry?// Penny: No. Come on, it’s Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen.// Amy: That’s what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened.// Bernadette: Yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months.// Amy: You don’t get it. I’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.// Penny: Well, what do you want us to do?// Amy: I don’t know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.// Bernadette: That’s ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch.// Amy: Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.// Penny: Come on. Looks don’t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.// Amy: Nice try.// Penny: Thanks. I was scrambling.// Scene: The comic book store.// Howard: It’s unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.// Leonard: Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I’m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars.// Raj: Can you even eat those things?// Leonard: If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.// Raj: Sounds like a lot of work.// Leonard: Eh, I’m worth it.// Howard: Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?// Leonard: Like what?// Raj: Uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into Sheldon.// Stuart: I’ll do it.// Leonard: No offence, Stuart, but the woman’s a doctor.// Stuart: So? Doctors like me. Whenever I see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look.// Howard: She’s not that kind of doctor.// Stuart: Oh. Well, her loss. I’ve been called a genuine medical oddity.// Raj: Actually, I was going to suggest me.// Howard: Great. Anybody’s better than, mmm.// Stuart: Excuse me. They took out my spleen and gallbladder, not my feelings.// Raj: Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.// Ramona: Good to see you, too.// Raj: May I join you?// Ramona: No.// Raj: Good to see you.// Howard: We should call Guinness, that might be a record.// Raj: She’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.// Ramona: Dr. Cooper, over here.// Raj: I could have made her very happy.// Leonard: You kept walking. I think you did.// Penny: Do you really think there’s reason to worry?// Leonard: Yeah, she’s definitely going after Sheldon.// Raj: I made a play for her and she shot me down.// Penny: All right, well, that doesn’t prove anything.// Bernadette: Yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.// Raj: Like, really, a million?// Bernadette: Fine, hundreds.// Raj: Thank you.// Penny: The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.// Sheldon: Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki.// Ramona: Hi.// All; Hi.// Sheldon: We just went swimming.// Scene: The same, later.// Leonard: And you actually got in a pool?// Sheldon: I was scared, but I told myself it’s just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub.// Ramona: I was proud of him, a lot of people don’t put their face in the water on the first day.// Sheldon: Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.// Bernadette: Can I just squeeze in here?// Penny: So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?// Sheldon: Yes, we skyped this morning and I’m sure I’ll check in with her before I go to sleep.// Ramona: Sheldon talks about her all the time. I can’t wait to meet her.// Sheldon: That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy’s going to be gone.// Leonard: Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?// Sheldon: Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?// Ramona: No, my work doesn’t leave me a lot of time for relationships.// Raj: I think you made that very clear.// Sheldon: She was part of the American team at CERN.// Ramona: I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson.// Sheldon: Do you know, I’ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?// Ramona: Absolutely.// Sheldon: I’ll get them.// Ramona: Well, hang on, I’ll come with you.// Sheldon: Oh, fun. Like a play date.// Penny: Okay, correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?// Bernadette: I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?// Leonard: You think you should call Amy?// Penny: You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.// Scene: Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.// Sheldon: Here you go.// Ramona: Are these all from Peter Higgs?// Sheldon: Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. They’re from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me.// Amy: Hello, Sheldon.// Sheldon: Oh, hello, Amy.// Amy: I was missing you again.// Sheldon: I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She’s right here.// Amy: She’s what?// Ramona: Hello.// Amy: Hi.// Ramona: So nice to meet you.// Amy: Uh-huh. Hang on. (answering phone) Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry.// (answering phone)// Sheldon: What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?// Amy: It’s not important.// Sheldon: I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don’t you agree?// Ramona: I do.// Sheldon: See? We both think so.// Penny: All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody’s got to go over there.// Leonard: You got feet and legs, you do it.// Penny: Will you go with me?// Bernadette: To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?// Raj: We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.// Howard: You done trying to make yourself feel better?// Raj: No. I haven’t played the race card yet.// Sheldon: Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says I’m tired and have to go to bed.// Ramona: It was nice seeing everybody. Thank you for dinner.// Penny: Sure.// Leonard: Our pleasure.// Raj: Whatever.// Ramona: Walk me to my car?// Sheldon: Of course.// Penny: We’ll all go.// Bernadette: Excuse me.// Penny: Pardon. I just need to., yeah.// Sheldon: That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.// Scene: The street.// Sheldon: Bye.// Penny: We need to talk.// Sheldon: What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don’t like it either.// Penny: Okay, I know you don’t have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you.// Sheldon: That doesn’t make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.// Penny: Well, sometimes women don’t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.// Sheldon: That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzki’s just a friend. In fact, I wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.// Penny: Okay. Um, let’s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect.// Sheldon: I already do.// Penny: Well, then you get it.// Sheldon: Because there’s only one of me, I’m more valuable.// Penny: Right.// Sheldon: Although, Amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me.// Penny: Let’s forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe…// Sheldon: Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I don’t think that’s what’s happening.// Penny: All right. What do you think is happening?// Sheldon: I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.// Penny: Don’t look at me like that, I tried.// Scene: Sheldon’s office.// Ramona: Hey, did you eat yet?// Sheldon: Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.// Ramona: Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches.// Sheldon: How thoughtful. Thank you.// Ramona: Mmm. No big deal, I enjoy spending time with you.// Sheldon: And I with you. Question, are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?// Ramona: What if I were?// Sheldon: Well, that would raise a number of problems. We’re colleagues. I’m currently in a relation… Excuse me a moment.// Scene: Princeton.// Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Will you marry me?// (Knock, knock, knock)"
