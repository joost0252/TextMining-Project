"3","Series 03 Episode 01 – The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation"
"3","Scene: Opening shows some scenes from the final episode of the previous season, followed by the caption “Three months later.” Scene then opens in lobby, with the guys arriving home from the North Pole. All have long hair and bushy beards except Sheldon, whose hair is slightly longer and who has a goatee."
"3","Leonard: Oh, thank God we’re home."
"3","Howard: I can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell."
"3","Raj: It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half."
"3","Scene: The apartment door. Sheldon is on the phone."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet. (Walks through door) Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk."
"3","Leonard: I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back."
"3","Sheldon: Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. (To his spot) Hello, old friend. (Sits) Daddy’s home."
"3","Scene: Penny’s door."
"3","Penny: Leonard, you’re back."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, I just stopped by to say… (she grabs him and kisses him) Yeah, so, hi!"
"3","Penny: Hi! (They stumble, kissing, into her apartment and slam the door shut)"
"3","Howard: Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back."
"3","Raj: Yeah, it was first come, first served."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3","Scene: A moment later."
"3","Sheldon: I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions."
"3","Howard: Great."
"3","Raj: Thanks."
"3","Sheldon: Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
"3","Raj: We have to tell him."
"3","Sheldon: Tell me what?"
"3","Howard: Damn his Vulcan hearing."
"3","Sheldon: You fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?"
"3","Howard: Okay, Sheldon, sit down."
"3","Sheldon: If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea."
"3","Howard: Yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole."
"3","Sheldon: If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about."
"3","Raj: It’s not about that."
"3","Howard: And we agreed to never speak of it again."
"3","Sheldon: So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting."
"3","Howard: He’s speaking about it."
"3","Raj: For me, it was a bonding moment."
"3","Howard: Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?"
"3","Raj: I thought we were going to be gentle with him."
"3","Howard: That’s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D."
"3","Howard: Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off."
"3","Raj: He just went colon, capital O."
"3","Sheldon: You tampered with my experiment?"
"3","Howard: We had to."
"3","Raj: It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian."
"3","Sheldon: Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know."
"3","Howard: Actually, it was his idea."
"3","Sheldon: Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard."
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"3","Penny: I missed you so much."
"3","Leonard: I missed you, too."
"3","Penny: I couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone."
"3","Leonard: Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard."
"3","Leonard (whispering): Do not make a sound."
"3","Sheldon: Whispering do not make a sound is a sound."
"3","Leonard: Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"3","Penny: Oh, this is ridiculous. What?"
"3","Sheldon: Hello, Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?"
"3","Penny: It’s great to see you too. Come on in."
"3","Sheldon: Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
"3","Leonard: Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don’t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
"3","Penny: Okay, can someone please tell me what’s going on here?"
"3","Sheldon: What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
"3","Penny: Is that true?"
"3","Leonard: It was the only way to make him happy."
"3","Penny: Why did you have to make him happy?"
"3","Leonard: Because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
"3","Sheldon: That seems like a bit of an overreaction."
"3","Leonard: No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe."
"3","Leonard: Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal."
"3","Sheldon: You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal"
"3","Penny: Oh, the poor thing."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, I feel terrible."
"3","Penny: Wait, wait. Aren’t you going to go talk to him?"
"3","Leonard: What? Uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here."
"3","Penny: No, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. I will."
"3","Leonard: Man, I cannot catch a break."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Penny knocks and enters."
"3","Penny: Hey. Do you want to talk?"
"3","Sheldon: About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!"
"3","Penny: Oh, hon… Uh… (singing) Soft kitty, warm kitty…"
"3","Sheldon: That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick."
"3","Penny: Oh. Sorry. I don’t know your sad song."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child."
"3","Penny: Well, you know, I do understand what you’re going through."
"3","Sheldon: Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?"
"3","Penny: Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol’ slutbag."
"3","Sheldon: Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?"
"3","Penny: Well, they’re pretty tasty."
"3","Sheldon: And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
"3","Penny: Look, Sheldon, I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?"
"3","Sheldon: I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!"
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria. The guys have shaved and had haircuts. Howard has kept his moustache."
"3","Raj: I like the new look."
"3","Howard: Thanks. I call it the Clooney."
"3","Raj: I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how’s Sheldon doing?"
"3","Leonard: Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better."
"3","Howard: If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally… you know."
"3","Leonard: Howard…"
"3","Howard: Personally, I don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask."
"3","Leonard: Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business."
"3","Howard (to his genitals): He says they didn’t do it."
"3","Leonard (to Sheldon, entering): Sheldon, over here. (Sheldon sits at another table and tries to choke all three to death with the force. Raj pretends he is choking.)"
"3","Howard: What are you doing?"
"3","Raj: I feel bad for the guy."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?"
"3","Sheldon: Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated."
"3","Leonard: Come on. We said we were sorry."
"3","Sheldon: It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me."
"3","Kripke (arriving): Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation."
"3","Sheldon: You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning."
"3","Kripke: That’s not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife."
"3","Sheldon: All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour."
"3","Kripke: Off a cwiff."
"3","Sheldon: My credibility may have been damaged…"
"3","Kripke: Compwetely wecked."
"3","Sheldon: But I would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein."
"3","Kripke: Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein’s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you’re still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
"3","Leonard: So much for our friendship with Sheldon."
"3","Raj: Well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out."
"3","Penny: Hi."
"3","Leonard: Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn’t have a chance to give you this."
"3","Penny: Oh, Leonard, you shouldn’t have. Oh, boy! What is it?"
"3","Leonard: It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole."
"3","Penny: Are you serious?"
"3","Leonard: Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin."
"3","Penny: Oh, my God. That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that I didn’t understand."
"3","Leonard: It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on… (she kisses him)"
"3","Howard (arriving): Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away."
"3","Leonard: Man, I can not catch a break."
"3","Penny: So, how do you know he ran away?"
"3","Howard: Well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I’m running away."
"3","Leonard: Okay, well, thanks for letting me know."
"3","Penny: Well, Leonard, aren’t you going to do something?"
"3","Leonard: Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment. (His phone rings) Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment."
"3","Penny: Well, you’re not gonna go with them?"
"3","Leonard: Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don’t want to go to Texas!"
"3","Howard: Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we’re done."
"3","Leonard: Trust me, you’ll be fine. See ya."
"3","Penny: Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He’s your best friend."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here."
"3","Penny: No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon."
"3","Leonard: Really?"
"3","Penny: Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days."
"3","Leonard: Maybe you can."
"3","Penny: Go."
"3","Raj: Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?"
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s mother’s kitchen."
"3"," "
"3","Mrs Cooper: Here you go, Shelly."
"3","Sheldon: Thanks, Mom."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat."
"3","Sheldon: Aw, Mom."
"3","Mrs Cooper: This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all…"
"3","Sheldon: Fed."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Give us, Lord, our daily…"
"3","Sheldon: Bread."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Please know that we are truly…"
"3","Sheldon: Grateful."
"3","Mrs Cooper: For every cup and every…"
"3","Sheldon: Plateful."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Amen. Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?"
"3","Sheldon: My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Whatever. Jesus still loves you."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he’s Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?"
"3","Sheldon: They’re not my friends."
"3","Mrs Cooper: All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids."
"3","Sheldon: That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you."
"3","Scene: A rental car."
"3","Leonard: I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat."
"3","Howard: Hello? I’m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys’ large they had."
"3","Raj: I’m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where’s the tumbleweeds? Where’s the saloons?"
"3","Leonard: Saloons?"
"3","Raj: Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas."
"3","Howard: This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
"3","Raj: I was really hoping to see a cattle drive."
"3","Leonard: What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s mother’s house."
"3","Leonard: Will you please take that stupid hat off?"
"3","Howard: No, I want to blend in."
"3","Raj: To what? Toy Story?"
"3","Mrs Cooper: Hi, boys."
"3","Howard: Howdy, ma’am."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Howdy to you, too. You got here quick."
"3","Leonard: – We took the red-eye."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Well, come on in."
"3","Howard: Thank you kindly."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Can I… Can I get you something to drink?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, no, thank you."
"3","Howard: If y’all don’t mind, I got a hankerin’ for a Lone Star beer."
"3","Mrs Cooper: There’s no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat."
"3","Howard: Sorry. I’ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it."
"3","Mrs Cooper: You’ll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn’t it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who’s an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she’d be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you."
"3","Leonard: Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it."
"3","Mrs Cooper: A girl?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, yes, ma’am."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Oh, good. I’ve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: What are they doing here?"
"3","Leonard: We came to apologize."
"3","Howard: Again."
"3","Leonard: And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back."
"3","Leonard: No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."
"3","Mrs Cooper: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion."
"3","Sheldon: Evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact."
"3","Mrs Cooper: And that is your opinion."
"3","Sheldon: I forgive you. Let’s go home."
"3","Mrs Cooper: Don’t tell me prayer doesn’t work."
"3","Scene: In Penny’s bed."
"3","Leonard: How about that? I finally caught a break."
"3","Penny: Uh-huh."
"3","Leonard: You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?"
"3","Penny: Sure."
"3","Leonard: Why does it have to get weird?"
"3","Penny: I don’t know."
"3","Leonard: I mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…"
"3","Penny: Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah?"
"3","Penny: It’s weird."
"3","Leonard: Totally."
"3","(* This scene was originally filmed using the word “coke” but it was overdubbed for television purposes. On the DVD version, the original is used.)"
"3","Series 03 Episode 02 – The Jiminy Conjecture"
"3","Scene: The comic book store."
"3","Howard: Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws."
"3","Sheldon: Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?"
"3","Howard: Okay, first of all…"
"3","Raj: Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person."
"3","Sheldon: I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested."
"3","Leonard: Hey, guys."
"3","Howard: What are you doing here?"
"3","Leonard: What do you mean? It’s new comic book night."
"3","Raj: Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."
"3","Leonard: There’s more to life than sex, Raj."
"3","Howard: Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?"
"3","Sheldon: I did."
"3","Leonard: Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know."
"3","Howard: You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended."
"3","Raj: Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky."
"3","Leonard: It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve."
"3","Howard: What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy."
"3","Sheldon: Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction."
"3","Raj: Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
"3","Leonard: Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine."
"3","Raj: Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine."
"3","Leonard: I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great."
"3","Howard: Okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?"
"3","Raj: Oh, yeah."
"3","Leonard: To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…"
"3","Raj: Disappointed? Let down?"
"3","Howard: Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?"
"3","Leonard: All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be."
"3","Howard: Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be."
"3","Raj: That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down."
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
"3","Credits Sequence"
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, dinner’s here."
"3","Sheldon: Tandoori Palace?"
"3","Leonard: No, we went somewhere new."
"3","Sheldon: You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?"
"3","Leonard: No, look, Mumbai Palace."
"3","Sheldon: Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace."
"3","Leonard: Trust me, this will be just fine."
"3","Howard: You are the authority on just fine."
"3","Leonard: What’s that supposed to mean?"
"3","Howard (after Raj whispers to him): Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great."
"3","Penny: What are they talking about?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t know"
"3","Sheldon: I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…"
"3","Leonard: Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh."
"3","Sheldon: If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
"3","Penny: Okay, yeah, well, I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside."
"3","Leonard: Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?"
"3","Sheldon: I sense I may have crossed some sort of line."
"3","Raj: Yeah, you…"
"3","Howard: Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out."
"3","Penny: Ugh, I am so embarrassed!"
"3","Leonard: Please don’t be mad."
"3","Penny: What did you tell them?"
"3","Leonard: Nothing bad, just that last night was fine."
"3","Penny: Fine? You said it was fine?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?"
"3","Penny: It was… okay."
"3","Leonard: Okay?"
"3","Penny: Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes."
"3","Leonard: So, you’ve been through this before?"
"3","Penny: No."
"3","Leonard: Okay-dokay."
"3","Penny: You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?"
"3","Leonard: So much."
"3","Penny: Okay. See, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off."
"3","Leonard: Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."
"3","Penny: Don’t talk, just drink."
"3","Howard: No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them."
"3","Raj: Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t."
"3","Sheldon: Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. (Howard indicates that he has got it.) Oh, good! Now I can eat."
"3","Raj: What’s that?"
"3","Howard: Sounds like a cricket."
"3","Sheldon: Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket."
"3","Howard: Oh, give me a frickin’ break. How could you possibly know that?"
"3","Sheldon: In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."
"3","Raj: How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?"
"3","Sheldon: Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06."
"3","Howard: Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket."
"3","Sheldon: Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play."
"3","Howard: No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin."
"3","Raj: Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess."
"3","Sheldon: That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade."
"3","Howard: Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket."
"3","Sheldon: I can’t take your money."
"3","Howard: What’s the matter, you chicken?"
"3","Sheldon: I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."
"3","Raj: Chickens can’t climb trees"
"3","Sheldon: Thank God."
"3","Howard: Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me."
"3","Sheldon: Fair enough. What stake do you propose?"
"3","Howard: I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue."
"3","Sheldon: All right, you have a wager."
"3","Howard: Hmm."
"3","Raj: Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it."
"3","Slight time shift. The guys are searching for the cricket."
"3","Raj: I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight."
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment, Penny and Leonard are kissing. They break and look at each other uncomfortably."
"3","Leonard: More wine?"
"3","Penny: Hit me."
"3","Scene: The apartment, the guys are still searching for the cricket. They are inside the cupboard."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t see anything."
"3","Howard: Shh!"
"3","Raj: Hallway. (All try to exit at once and get stuck in doorway.)"
"3","Sheldon: One at a time. (Same thing happens again. Eventually they leave the apartment. There is a growling noise.) What was that?"
"3","Raj: My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?"
"3","Howard: Shh! Elevator shaft."
"3","Sheldon: Help me open it."
"3","Howard: Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft."
"3","Sheldon: Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four."
"3","Howard: Let’s open her up."
"3","Sheldon: Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?"
"3","Howard: Don’t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"
"3","Raj: Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"3","Leonard: What are we drinking now?"
"3","Penny: Peppermint schnapps."
"3","Leonard: Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?"
"3","Penny: Because I like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: What?"
"3","Penny: Schnapps."
"3","Leonard: Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun."
"3","Scene: The elevator shaft. Sheldon is inside."
"3","Raj: Be careful."
"3","Sheldon: If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
"3","Raj (hearing the cricket): Stairwell."
"3","Sheldon: Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here."
"3","Scene: Penny’s bathroom. Leonard is vomiting in the toilet."
"3","Penny: Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?"
"3","Leonard: I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)"
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria. Raj has the cricket in a jar."
"3","Raj: Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?"
"3","Sheldon: His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket."
"3","Raj: What would you name him?"
"3","Sheldon: An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy."
"3","Howard: All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast’s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose."
"3","Sheldon: Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."
"3","Howard: That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?"
"3","Raj: Oh, I really don’t care anymore"
"3","Leonard: God, I had the most horrible night."
"3","Raj: What happened?"
"3","Sheldon: Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess."
"3","Howard: Shiksa. Shik-sa."
"3","Sheldon: Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long."
"3","Howard: Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you’re wrong again."
"3","Sheldon: We haven’t established that I’m wrong once."
"3","Howard: All right. Tell you what, let’s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor"
"3","Crawley tell us what kind of cricket Toby is."
"3","Sheldon: He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. (They leave)"
"3","Leonard: I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends."
"3","Scene: The Entomology Department."
"3"," "
"3","Raj: Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here. (Howard tickles the back of his neck. He screams) Don’t do that!"
"3","Howard: You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs."
"3","Raj: Yeah, well, I don’t like bugs, okay? They freak me out."
"3","Sheldon: Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome"
"3","Prof Crawley (arriving): Don’t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle?"
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?"
"3","Prof Crawley: Who wants to know?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department."
"3","Prof Crawley: Couldn’t wait, huh?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry?"
"3","Prof Crawley: I haven’t even packed yet, and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines."
"3","Howard: No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question."
"3","Prof Crawley: Let me ask you one first. What’s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?"
"3","Raj: Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?"
"3","Prof Crawley: What’s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?"
"3","Raj: I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist."
"3","Sheldon: No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?"
"3","Prof Crawley: Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we’re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We’re talking Oxnard in the onion fields."
"3","Howard: Well, could you look at Toby?"
"3","Prof Crawley: Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket."
"3","Sheldon: Told you."
"3","Prof Crawley: It’s a field cricket."
"3","Howard: Yes!"
"3","Sheldon: No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?"
"3","Prof Crawley: Young man, I’ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley."
"3","Sheldon: Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential."
"3","Prof Crawley: Let me show you something. See that? That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that’s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can’t. That tramp took me for everything!"
"3","Sheldon: Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations."
"3","Raj: Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you."
"3","Scene: The lobby."
"3","Penny: Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?"
"3","Sheldon: Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box."
"3","Penny: What do you have a safe deposit box for?"
"3","Sheldon: Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager."
"3","Penny: What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular."
"3","Sheldon: Penny, I’d rather not talk about it."
"3","Penny: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m not feeling so hot either."
"3","Sheldon: Why would that make me feel better?"
"3","Penny: I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken."
"3","Penny: What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?"
"3","Sheldon: A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley."
"3","Penny: Okay, forget the chicken."
"3","Sheldon: Well, I wish I could."
"3","Penny: No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard."
"3","Sheldon: Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?"
"3","Penny: No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends."
"3","Sheldon: I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned."
"3","Scene: The apartment"
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Leonard: Hey. What’s going on?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz."
"3","Leonard: Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?"
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz."
"3","Leonard: Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes."
"3","Leonard: Interesting."
"3","Sheldon: Hardly."
"3","Leonard: Excuse me."
"3","Sheldon: Have I crossed some sort of line again?"
"3","Leonard: Little bit. (Exits)"
"3","Sheldon: Hmm. Oh, who cares?"
"3","Scene: Penny’s doorway."
"3","Penny: Oh, hey."
"3","Leonard: Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?"
"3","Penny: Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends."
"3","Leonard: Is that what you want?"
"3","Penny: I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends."
"3","Leonard: I guess."
"3","Penny: It would take the pressure off."
"3","Leonard: It would, wouldn’t it?"
"3","Penny: So, we’ll just be friends."
"3","Leonard: Good, good."
"3","Penny: Come here. (She gives him a hug. It turns into a big kiss.)"
"3","Leonard (closing door): Okay-dokay"

"3","Scene: The apartment kitchen. Penny is cooking breakfast while singing and dancing along to “Man I Feel Like A Woman” by Shenia Twain. Sheldon enters."
"3","Penny: Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me."
"3","Sheldon: No."
"3","Penny: Why not?"
"3","Sheldon: Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing."
"3","Penny: Are you fun in any of them?"
"3","Sheldon: The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance."
"3","Penny: All right, want some French toast?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s Oatmeal Day."
"3","Penny: Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal."
"3","Sheldon: Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?"
"3","Leonard: Morning."
"3","Sheldon: Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast."
"3","Leonard: Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet."
"3","Sheldon: It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment."
"3","Leonard: We did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
"3","Sheldon: I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?"
"3","Leonard: No, her bed kind of… broke."
"3","Sheldon: That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition"
"3","of a second normal size human being wouldn’t cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself."
"3","Penny: A homunculus?"
"3","Leonard: Perfectly formed miniature human being."
"3","Penny: Oh, you’re my little homunculus."
"3","Leonard: Don’t do that."
"3","Penny: Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?"
"3","Sheldon: I want oatmeal."
"3","Penny: Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass."
"3","Sheldon: I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal."
"3","Penny: You know what, I give up. He’s impossible."
"3","Sheldon: I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny."
"3","Sheldon: What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible."
"3","Leonard: I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
"3","Sheldon: You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?"
"3","Leonard: It’s a… (gives up)"
"3","Sheldon: Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday."

"3"," "
"3","Penny: Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim."
"3","Leonard: Wow!"
"3","Penny: I know. What are the odds?"
"3","Sheldon: Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches."
"3","Penny: Ooh, Sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you."
"3","Leonard: Come on, you guys, let it go."
"3","Penny: Fine, whatever. Are you finished?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate"
"3","Penny: Um, yeah, sure, thanks."
"3","Leonard: What was that?"
"3","Sheldon: You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice."
"3","Leonard: It does. But in my experience, you don’t."
"3","Sheldon: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable."
"3","Howard (arriving, in goth gear): What’s going on, day dwellers?"
"3","Penny: Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don’t ask, don’t tell?"
"3","Howard: No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?"
"3","Penny: Oh, wow, you’re actually going out like that?"
"3","Howard: No, no. I’m going out like this. (Whips off jacket to reveal tattoos up both arms)"
"3","Leonard: Howard, what did you do?"
"3","Howard: They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery."
"3","Sheldon: You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub."
"3","Howard: Really?"
"3","Sheldon: Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?"
"3","Howard: Okay, how about you two? Look, I’ve got some extra tat sleeves."
"3","Leonard: Why are you carrying extras?"
"3","Howard: Well, In case I snag one on someone’s nipple ring."
"3","Penny: Uh, yeah, I think we’ll pass."
"3","Howard: Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?"
"3","Leonard: In this case, you bet she is."
"3","Howard (after Raj whispers): Yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner."
"3","Leonard: They’re gonna get beaten up at that club."
"3","Penny: They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot."
"3","Sheldon: Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate."
"3","Penny: Thank you."
"3","Scene: The goth club."
"3","Raj: I think we’re fitting in quite nicely."
"3","Howard: It’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer."
"3","Raj: Oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"
"3","Howard: Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?"
"3","Raj: No, I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now."
"3","Howard: What?"
"3","Raj: Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining."
"3","Howard: Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night."
"3","Raj: Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys."
"3","Girl: Good for you."
"3","Howard: I’m actually much morelost than he is."
"3","Girl: Nice ink."

"3","Second girl: What’s your names?"
"3","Howard: I’m Howard."

"3","Howard: Nice to meet you, Bethany."
"3","Raj: Yes, very nice."
"3","Bethany: Nice to meet you too."
"3","Second girl: I’m Sarah. Not that anyone cares."
"3","Raj: Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?"
"3","Penny: What’s this cartoon called again?"
"3","Leonard: Oshikuru: Demon Samurai."
"3","Sheldon: And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime."
"3","Penny: Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three."
"3","Sheldon: You’re here a lot now."
"3","Penny: Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. Chocolate?"
"3","Penny: Yes please. (Her phone rings) Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I… (sees Sheldon looking disapprovingly) You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. (Sheldon silently offers her another chocolate. She takes it.) You’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…"
"3","Leonard: Okay, I know what you’re doing."
"3","Sheldon: Really?"
"3","Leonard: Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour."
"3","Sheldon: Very good. Chocolate?"
"3","Leonard: No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat."
"3","Sheldon: Actually, it turns out I can."
"3","Leonard: Well, you shouldn’t."
"3","Sheldon: There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
"3","Leonard: No, this has to stop now."
"3","Sheldon: I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will."
"3","Leonard: No, you’re not sanding Penny."
"3","Sheldon: Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
"3","Leonard: Yes, you’re forbidden."
"3","Sheldon (Squirting him with a water spray): Bad Leonard."
"3","Bethany: So what do you guys do?"
"3","Howard: Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music."
"3","Raj: Goth food."
"3","Sarah: What’s goth food?"
"3","Raj: Uh… blackened salmon?"
"3","Bethany: No, I meant what do you do for jobs?"
"3","Raj: Oh, we’re scientists."
"3","Howard: Yeah, you know, the dark sciences."
"3","Bethany: What are the dark sciences"
"3","Raj: Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about."
"3","Howard: Oy vay."
"3","Raj: That sounds really cool."
"3","Howard: Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream."
"3","Raj: So what do you gals do?"
"3","Bethany: I work at the Gap."
"3","Howard: Really? How about that? I’ve been to the Gap."
"3","Raj: Yeah, I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket."
"3","Sarah: I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring."
"3","Bethany: Yeah. Why don’t we go somewhere else and have some fun?"
"3","Howard: Okay."
"3","Raj: Sure, we like fun."
"3","Howard: We are fun people."
"3","Raj: Dark and fun."
"3","Bethany: Come on, I know a place you’ll really dig."
"3","Howard: Did you bring the black condoms?"
"3","Raj: In my fanny pack."
"3","Howard: Let’s go."
"3","Scene: A tattoo parlour. Bethany is getting a tattoo."
"3","Raj: Are you happy now?"
"3","Howard: Not particularly."
"3","Penny (voice outside door): Oh’ my God, she didn’t!"
"3","Leonard: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?"
"3","Sheldon: Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week."
"3","Leonard: No."
"3","Sheldon: If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed."
"3","Leonard: You’re not squirting her in the face with water."
"3","Sheldon: No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever."
"3","Leonard: Forget it."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend."
"3","Leonard: I’m not. And Penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
"3","Sheldon: You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?"
"3","Leonard: Yes."
"3","Sheldon You wouldn’t prefer a throaty chuckle?"
"3","Leonard: You’re not changing how Penny laughs."
"3","Sheldon: No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
"3","Penny (entering): Uh, sorry guys, that girl is (high pitched) freaky!"
"3","Sheldon: Come again?"
"3","Penny (normal voice): Freaky."
"3","Sheldon (lower voice): Freaky?"
"3","Penny (lower voice): Yeah, freaky."
"3","Sheldon: Have a chocolate."
"3","Scene: The tattoo parlour. Howard is laying down, preparing to have a tattoo on his lower back."
"3","Raj: Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?"
"3","Howard: Uh, yeah!"
"3","Raj: What is your mother going to say?"
"3","Howard: She’s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now."
"3","Bethany: What are you going to get, Howard?"
"3","Howard: Well, I can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog."
"3","Bethany: Kermit the Frog?"
"3","Howard: You know (Kermit voice) Hi ho, I’m on Howard’s butt!"
"3","Bethany: Get the mean little skull, and I’ll see if I can make him smile."
"3","Howard: Yeah, I’d like the mean little skull, please."
"3","Sarah: What are you going to get, Raj?"
"3","Raj: With my luck, hepatitis"
"3","Tattooist: Okay, here we go."
"3","Howard: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"3","Tattooist: That’s just rubbing alcohol."
"3","Howard: I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!"
"3","Tattooist: I’m putting on the stencil."
"3","Howard: What comes after the stencil?"
"3","Tattooist: This."
"3","Howard: Aaaaaargh! Okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo."
"3","Bethany: What’s the big deal, you’ve done this before."
"3","Howard: No, I haven’t, look. (Rips off tattoo sleeves) I’m sorry, I’m a fraud, he’s a fraud."
"3","Raj: We’re both frauds."
"3","Howard: Yeah, I think I covered that."
"3","Raj: But I was summing up."
"3","Howard: We’re not goth, we’re just guys."
"3","Raj: Very, very smart guys."
"3","Bethany: So you were totally scamming us?"
"3","Howard: Yes. And I wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive."
"3","Bethany: I’m leaving."
"3","Sarah: I’m leaving too. Not that anyone cares."
"3","Raj: When we tell this story, let’s end it differently."
"3","Howard: What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum."
"3","Penny: Of course."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. (Throws a chocolate. Penny catches it in her mouth)"
"3","Penny: Mmm, these are so good"
"3","Leonard: Unbelievable."
"3","Penny: What?"
"3","Leonard: I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
"3","Penny: well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place."
"3","Leonard: Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late."
"3","Penny: Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet."
"3","Leonard: Let’s go."
"3","Sheldon: Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that."
"3","Scene: Raj’s car."
"3","Howard: Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends."
"3","Raj: I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?"
"3","Howard: What’s that got to do with the story?"
"3","Raj: Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me."
"3","Howard: Fine, they smelled good."
"3","Raj: Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle."
"3","Howard: Whatever."
"3","Raj: And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us."
"3","Howard: No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick."
"3","Raj: I’m sorry. Go on."
"3","Howard: Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place."
"3","Raj: But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?"
"3","Howard: We say they’re in a very intimate area."
"3","Raj: Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?"
"3","Howard: Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub."
"3","Raj: But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?"
"3","Howard: True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls."
"3","Raj: Wow. What a great night."
"3","Howard: Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night."
"3","Raj: Yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls."
"3","Howard: Could happen."
"3","Raj: I wonder how they smell."

"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Sheldon: This movie baffles me every time we watch it."
"3","Leonard: What do you mean?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?"
"3","Penny (arriving): Hi, guys. Hi, honey."
"3","Leonard: Hey."
"3","Howard: Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."
"3","Penny: You’re boring people sweetie."
"3","Sheldon: Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely."
"3","Penny: So, what are you guys doing?"
"3","Howard: Celebrating Columbus Day."
"3","Leonard: We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus."
"3","Penny: Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?"
"3","Sheldon: The parade."
"3","Penny: Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial."
"3","Leonard: What’s he on trial for?"
"3","Penny: Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited."
"3","Leonard: Oh. I’ll be there."
"3","Sheldon: Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?"
"3","Penny: I guess I could serve both."
"3","Sheldon: You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this."
"3","Howard: Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil."
"3","Penny: Tur-briska-fil?"
"3","Howard: Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds."
"3","Penny: Raj, what about you?"
"3","Howard: Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? (Raj bursts into tears and runs away) All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3"," "
"3","Scene: A few moments later."
"3","Leonard: So, what’s going on with Raj?"
"3","Howard: Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil."
"3","Penny: Hard to believe, but go on."
"3","Howard: The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported."
"3","Leonard: What do you mean, he’s getting deported?"
"3","Sheldon: I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate."
"3","Howard: Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?"
"3","Penny: Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues."
"3","Sheldon: Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession."
"3","Howard: Okay, she’s gone."
"3","Raj: Sorry. I lost my cool."
"3","Leonard: So, what’s going on?"
"3","Raj: Okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end."
"3","Howard: So?"
"3","Raj: So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat."
"3","Leonard: So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?"
"3","Raj: You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?"
"3","Sheldon: And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate."
"3","Raj: I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere."
"3","Howard: Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?"
"3","Penny (from outside): Why doesn’t he just get another job?"
"3","Howard (after Raj whispers to him): What are you asking me for? I don’t know if you can talk now or not."
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria."
"3","Raj: Oh, beef, I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald’s, you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,"
"3","believe you me, is really not that special."
"3","Leonard: Don’t worry, you’ll find another job."
"3","Raj: Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”"
"3","Sheldon: Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj."
"3","Raj: Hello Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated."
"3","Raj: I’m sad."
"3","Sheldon: I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged."
"3","Raj: What are you eating?"
"3","Sheldon: Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce."
"3","Raj: Oh, beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all."
"3","Leonard: I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?"
"3","Raj: We believe cows are gods."
"3","Sheldon: Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God."
"3","Raj: Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry."
"3","Raj: Me, too. I’m just, I’m a little on edge."
"3","Sheldon: Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best."
"3","Raj: Thank you."
"3","Sheldon: And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows."
"3","Howard (arriving): Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team."
"3","Raj: You, you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!"
"3","Howard: Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview."
"3","Raj: I’m on it."
"3","Sheldon: That’s happy, right?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah."
"3","Sheldon: Nailed it."
"3","Scene: Professor Laughlin’s office."
"3","Prof Laughlin: Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?"
"3","Raj: No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis."
"3","Prof Laughlin: Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?"
"3","Raj: It’s a little early, isn’t it?"
"3","Prof Laughlin: Not on Proxima Centauri."
"3","Raj: That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan."
"3","Prof Laughlin: Oh, well done. I have a feeling you’re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali."
"3","Raj: Thank you, sir. (There is a knock on the door. A young woman enters)"
"3","Woman: I’m sorry. Am I late?"
"3","Prof Laughlin: No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She’ll be heading up our data analysis team."
"3","Dr Millstone: It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? (During this, Raj surreptitiously wanders over to where Prof Laughlin’s drinks are, pours himself a large sherry and knocks it back in one.)"
"3","Raj: Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency."
"3","Dr Millstone: That’s just fascinating."
"3","Raj: Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?"
"3","Howard: What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?"
"3","Raj: You know, he’s British, I’m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much."
"3","Leonard: Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint."
"3","Raj: That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service."
"3","Howard: I’m really going to miss you."
"3","Raj: Will you come visit me in India?"
"3","Howard: Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?"
"3","Raj: Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan."
"3","Howard: Tell you what, we’ll skype."
"3","Sheldon (arriving): Gentlemen."
"3","Sheldon: Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?"
"3","Raj: No."
"3","Sheldon: I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…"
"3","Leonard: Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me."
"3","Raj: You want me to work with you?"
"3","Sheldon: For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job."
"3","Raj: Okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you."
"3","Sheldon: For me."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"3","Raj (knocking and entering): Sheldon, are you busy?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course I’m busy."
"3","Raj: Shall I wait?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes, please. (After about 30 seconds) How may I help you?"
"3","Raj: I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you."
"3","Raj: Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture."
"3","Sheldon: I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions."
"3","Sheldon: I reject them all."
"3","Raj: Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job."
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview."
"3","Raj: Wha… You’re kidding!"
"3","Sheldon: Please."
"3","Raj: All right."
"3","Sheldon: So, that’s what you wear to an interview?"
"3","Raj: Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, pulling strings, are we?"
"3","Raj: Sheldon, for God’s sakes, don’t make me beg."
"3","Sheldon: Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that."
"3","Penny: Ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?"
"3","Leonard: Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
"3","Penny: Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?"
"3","Leonard: What are you thinking?"
"3","Penny: Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out."
"3","Leonard: You are a dirty girl."
"3","Penny (as the making out is interrupted by a knock on the door): Oh, God, how did he know?"
"3","Howard: Hello."
"3","Leonard: Hi, Howard."
"3","Howard: Am I interrupting?"
"3","Leonard: Little bit, yeah."
"3","Howard: Guess I should have called."
"3","Penny: Yeah, maybe."
"3","Howard: Tonight’s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino."
"3","Leonard: Uh-huh."
"3","Howard: But he’s working with Sheldon."
"3","Penny: Yes, we know."
"3","Howard: Want me to leave?"
"3","Leonard: You know, whatever."
"3","Howard: Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city."
"3","Yikes."
"3","Penny: Hey, I happen to love this movie."
"3","Howard: Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize."
"3","Sheldon: All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."
"3","Raj: Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke."
"3","Sheldon: I’m the boss. I make the jokes."
"3","Raj: Sorry, go ahead and make your joke."
"3","Sheldon: This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus."
"3","Raj: All right, let’s buckle down and work."
"3","(To the tune of Eye of the Tiger by Survivor, there is a montage of images, in all of which Sheldon and Raj are staring at the same equation on a whiteboard.)"
"3","Raj: Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: What?"
"3","Raj: I need an aspirin."
"3","Sheldon: Top desk drawer."
"3","Sheldon: Alright?"
"3","Raj: Yes."
"3","Sheldon: Good."
"3","(Montage of scenes resumes)"
"3","Scene: Penny and Leonard exiting Leonard’s bedroom."
"3","Leonard: That was fun. Thank you."
"3","Penny: Leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex."
"3","Leonard: Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away."
"3","Howard: Top o’ the mornin’o ya!"
"3","Leonard: What are you doing here?"
"3","Howard: Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour."
"3","Penny: Oh, kill me."
"3","Howard: By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard."
"3","Penny: See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that."
"3","Howard: What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?"
"3","Penny: Do something."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk."
"3","Howard: Sure. ‘sup, homes?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time."
"3","Howard: Oh. I get it, I’m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I’ll get out of your way. Uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot."
"3","Leonard: Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up."
"3","Penny: That’s great."
"3","Howard: Ill just hang out with my mom. That’s always fun."
"3","Leonard: Good."
"3","Penny: Are we terrible people?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t know. What do you want me to do?"
"3","Penny: Get him, bring him back."
"3","Leonard: Are you sure?"
"3","Penny: Yeah."
"3","Leonard: Okay. Howard come back."
"3","Howard: Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s office. Sheldon is writing on the whiteboard."
"3","Raj: No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?"
"3","Raj: I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space."
"3","Sheldon: Astro means star."
"3","Raj: Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I’d be kicking your butt."
"3","Sheldon: English is your native language."
"3","Raj: Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!"
"3","Sheldon: There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it."
"3","Raj: My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca."
"3","Sheldon: Caca?"
"3","Raj: It means doo-doo."
"3","Sheldon: All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…"
"3","Raj: Aha! So I am working with you."
"3","Sheldon: In this context, with me means for me."
"3","Raj: Ah, well, in this context… (blows raspberry)"
"3","Sheldon: Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it."
"3","Raj: Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle."
"3","Sheldon: No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target."
"3","Raj: Let me finish."
"3","Sheldon: You’re defacing my work."
"3","Raj: I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it."
"3","Sheldon: Give me the eraser."
"3","Sheldon: I said give it to me."
"3","Raj: Come and get it."
"3","Sheldon: Fine. (Uses hand as an eraser. Then realises his hand is dirty) Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!"
"3","Raj: You are not my superior."
"3","Sheldon: I am in every way."
"3","Raj: Oh, yeah? Can you do this? (Performs complex finger trick*) Nice working with you. I’m sorry, for you. (Exits. Sheldon stares a moment, then tries to perform the trick. Fails.)"
"3","Scene: Outside Raj’s flat."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj."
"3","Raj: I’m busy."
"3","Sheldon: Doing what? (Performs finger trick again) All right, you’ve made your point."
"3","Raj: What do you want, Sheldon?"
"3","Sheldon: I looked over the board and it turns out you were right."
"3","Raj: So you were wrong."
"3","Sheldon: I didn’t say that."
"3","Raj: That’s the only logical inference."
"3","Sheldon: Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me."
"3","Raj: For you or with you?"
"3","Sheldon: In this context for me could mean with me."
"3","Raj: All right, but I have some conditions."
"3","Raj: I’ll take the job. See you Monday."
"3","Sheldon: Wait, you have to drive me home."
"3","Raj: How did you get here?"
"3","Sheldon: I walked."
"3","Raj: So walk home."
"3","Sheldon: I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles."
"3","Raj: All right. (As they walk down the corridor, Eye of the Tiger starts playing again.)"

"3","The three guys: Kites, ho!"
"3","Penny: Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?"
"3","Leonard: If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho."
"3","Leonard: We’re heading out for some kite fighting."
"3","Penny: Kite fighting?"
"3","Leonard: Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport."
"3","Sheldon: Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger."
"3","Leonard: You want to come watch?"
"3","Penny: Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game."
"3","Leonard: Oh. Football, sure."
"3","Howard: Good guess."
"3","Penny: I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan."

"3","Leonard: So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you."
"3","Leonard: Oh, how kind of her."
"3","Sheldon: Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?"

"3","Penny: Sure you have."
"3","Leonard: Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?"

"3","Leonard: Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses."

"3","Leonard: Great."
"3","Scene: The apartment. Leonard and Raj are watching a football game on the television."
"3","Leonard: Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this."
"3","Raj: Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections."
"3","Leonard: Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj."
"3","Raj: I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help."

"3","Raj: I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?"
"3","Howard: Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?"
"3","Raj: It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them."
"3","Howard: But I had a shot with that jogger."
"3","Raj: Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. (Leaves)"
"3","Howard: It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?"
"3","Leonard: There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
"3","Howard: All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there."
"3","Leonard: Sacks, sacks…"
"3","Sheldon: It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage."
"3","Leonard: Huh… Scrimmage…"
"3","Sheldon: The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence."
"3","Leonard: Oh."
"3","Howard: Sheldon knows football?"
"3","Leonard: Apparently."
"3","Howard: I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?"
"3","Sheldon: I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot."
"3","Leonard: Unbelievable."
"3","Sheldon: If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken."
"3","Leonard: So you could teach me?"
"3","Sheldon: Football or chicken-fried meats?"
"3","Leonard: Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in."
"3","Sheldon: If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
"3","Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun."
"3","Sheldon: That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life."
"3","Leonard: Please, I’m asking you as a friend."
"3","Sheldon: Are you making this a tier one friendship request?"
"3","Leonard: Yes."
"3","Sheldon: Fine."
"3","Leonard: I really appreciate this."
"3","Sheldon: Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen."
"3","Leonard: I’m sorry?"
"3","Sheldon: That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself."
"3","Scene: The kitchen. Sheldon is making toast in a cylon toaster which burns an image of a cylon onto the toast."
"3","Leonard: When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?"
"3","Sheldon: When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?"
"3","Leonard: What’s wrong with a football jersey?"
"3","Sheldon: Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress."
"3","Leonard: I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way."
"3","Leonard: Anyway, wish me luck."
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
"3","Leonard: Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way."
"3","Sheldon: How would you put it?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, okay, like you said."
"3","Sheldon: Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho."
"3","Leonard: Good-Bye, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at."
"3","Sheldon: What’s funny about Cylon toast?"
"3","Scene: Raj’s apartment. Raj is watching a Bollywood movie. There is a knock on the door."
"3","Raj: It’s open."
"3","Howard: Hey, pal."
"3","Raj: What do you want?"
"3","Howard: I brought you a little gift. New kite."
"3","Raj: The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty."
"3","Howard: Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?"
"3","Raj: Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away."
"3","Howard: Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be."
"3","Raj: You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend."
"3","Howard: Stipulated."
"3","Raj: And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there."
"3","Howard: I know, I know."
"3","Raj: And where were you?"
"3","Howard: Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court."
"3","Raj: You’re impossible."
"3","Howard: Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk."
"3","Raj: Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche."
"3","Howard: No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself."
"3","Raj: No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you."
"3","Howard: Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want."
"3","Raj: I don’t know."
"3","Howard: Come on. Let me take you someplace nice."
"3","Raj: I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits."
"3","Howard: Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go."
"3","Raj: Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?"
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment. Everyone is watching football."
"3","Leonard: Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?"
"3","Penny: Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game."
"3","Leonard: Oh. Did not know that."
"3","Penny: How much beer have you had?"
"3","Leonard: None, why?"
"3","Penny: Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live."
"3","Leonard: Okay, yeah. I can see the difference."
"3","Guy in baseball hat: Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional grounding."
"3","Second guy: Totally."
"3","Leonard: That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul."
"3","Penny: Here, have some pizza, sweetie."
"3","Leonard: Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant."
"3","Penny: I know. I just need you stop talking."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, come in."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread."
"3","Penny: There’s some in the fridge."
"3","Sheldon: You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures."
"3","Penny: On Earth, we say thank you."
"3","Sheldon: So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?"
"3","Leonard: Mimesis?"
"3","Sheldon: You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis."
"3","Leonard: What the hell are you talking about?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
"3","Leonard: Oh, I guess so."
"3","Sheldon: Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here."
"3","Sheldon: I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances."
"3","Leonard: Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs."
"3","Penny: You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon."
"3","Leonard: No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left."
"3","Penny: Until half time."
"3","Leonard: This is just half? We’ve been here for hours."
"3","Penny: And you’re gonna be here for a couple more."
"3","Leonard: Oh, you’re kidding me."
"3","Penny: No."
"3","Leonard: Nice meeting all of you."
"3","Penny: So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart."
"3","Scene: The Le Brea Tar Pits."
"3","Raj: I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you."
"3","Howard: My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie."
"3","Raj: I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday."
"3","Howard: Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?"
"3","Raj: Fine. Go ahead."
"3","Howard: No. This is our day."
"3","Raj: If you want to chase after her, chase after her."
"3","Howard: Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that."
"3","Raj: Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man."
"3","Howard: You think so?"
"3","Raj: Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal."
"3","Howard: Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me."
"3","Raj: Actually, in this case, I think she was."
"3","Howard: Really?"
"3","Raj: Yeah."
"3","Howard: Bye."
"3","Raj: What a douche."
"3","Series 03 Episode 07 – The Guitarist Amplification"
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Penny: Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real."
"3","Leonard: We must not be playing it right."
"3","Penny: All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed."
"3","Sheldon: Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider."
"3","Penny: Yay."
"3","Sheldon: You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday."
"3","Leonard: Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday."
"3","Sheldon: Why not?"
"3","Leonard: Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?"
"3","Penny: Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport."
"3","Leonard: There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?"
"3","Penny: Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers."
"3","Leonard: Wait. What are you talking about?"
"3","Penny: My friend, Justin."
"3","Sheldon: Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday."
"3","Leonard: Who is this Justin?"
"3","Sheldon: Your turn, Leonard."
"3","Penny: I told you about him."
"3","Leonard: No, you didn’t."
"3","Sheldon: Roll the dice, Leonard."
"3","Penny: Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he’s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks."
"3","Sheldon: Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?"
"3","Leonard: Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?"
"3","Penny: He’s not some guy. He’s my friend."
"3","Leonard: So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?"
"3","Penny: Well, he’s definitely not gay."
"3","Leonard: Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee."
"3","Penny: Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out."
"3","Leonard: Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
"3","Sheldon: I’ll just roll for you."
"3","Penny: Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?"
"3","Leonard: What was your first clue?"
"3","Sheldon: Uh-oh! Industrial accident."
"3","Penny: You know what? Don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot."
"3","Leonard: I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!"
"3","Sheldon: You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina."
"3","Penny: How is that not talking to me like I’m an idiot? It’s my friend, it’s my couch, and it’s my freakin’ life!"
"3","Sheldon: It’s also your roll."
"3","Leonard: You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?"
"3","Penny: Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it’s none of your business!"
"3","Leonard: Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?"
"3","Penny: Oh, now I’m a child? Well, at least I’m not an idiot anymore!"
"3","Leonard: The two aren’t mutually exclusive!"
"3","Penny: Oh, you are such a… (Sheldon has placed ice in the blender and turned it on) What the hell is he doing?"
"3","Leonard: He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!"
"3","Leonard: I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender."
"3","Sheldon: Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?"
"3","Leonard: No, we just had a little spat."
"3","Sheldon: Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?"
"3","Credits sequence"
"3","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"3","Leonard: I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch."
"3","Sheldon: Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car."
"3","Leonard: I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?"
"3","Leonard: An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely."
"3","Sheldon: All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr."
"3","Leonard: And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!"
"3","Sheldon: Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her."
"3","Leonard: What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
"3","Sheldon: Leonard! Stop the car!"
"3","Leonard: What?"
"3","Sheldon: I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore."
"3","Scene: Leaving the apartment."
"3","Sheldon: Come on, come on, we’re late."
"3","Leonard: Calm down, we’ll make the movie."
"3","Sheldon: I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
"3","Raj: Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull."
"3","Sheldon: Go, go, Power Rangers, go!"
"3","Penny: Hey."
"3","Leonard: Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies."
"3","Sheldon: No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
"3","Leonard: Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?"
"3","Penny: Not really, no."
"3","Sheldon: All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening."
"3","Leonard: Just give us a minute."
"3","Howard: Oh, take all the time you need."
"3","Leonard: So, are we going to talk about last night?"
"3","Penny: Are you ready to apologize?"
"3","Leonard: No."
"3","Penny: E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing."
"3","Leonard: Oh, come on. This is stupid."
"3","Penny: Oh, there it is again! You think I’m stupid!"
"3","Leonard: No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."
"3","Penny: Oh, yeah? well, there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!"
"3","Leonard: No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!"
"3","Raj: Well, that was rather unpleasant."
"3","Howard: Yeah, I don’t think I need my preshow urination anymore."
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies."
"3","Scene: The comic book store."
"3"," "
"3","Howard: Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183."
"3","Sheldon: Got it."
"3","Howard: Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It’ll help take your mind off things."
"3","Stuart: Hey, guys. What’s going on?"
"3","Leonard: Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits."
"3","Stuart: Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let’s face it, that’s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books."
"3","Leonard: Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?"
"3","Howard: No, I mean, she’s obviously way out of line."
"3","Leonard: Thank you!"
"3","Howard: But if she dumps you, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?"
"3","Leonard: I am not going to fold."
"3","Raj: Well, excuse me, I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”"
"3","Howard: Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off."
"3","Raj: You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?"
"3","Howard: I didn’t know you were upset about that."
"3","Raj: Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset."
"3","Howard: Okay, sorry."
"3","Raj: Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!"
"3","Howard: I said I’m sorry."
"3","Raj: Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!"
"3","Howard: Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “Have you ever peed so much in your life?”"
"3","Raj: Oh, my God, you are such a mama’s boy."
"3","Howard: Hey, don’t bring my mother into this!"
"3","Raj: You brought your mother into this!"
"3","Sheldon: Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon."
"3","Howard: Boy, what got him so upset?"
"3","Raj: Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon’s upset."
"3","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory."
"3","Penny: Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
"3","Sheldon: This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm."
"3","Penny: Is Leonard coming?"
"3","Sheldon: No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize."
"3","Penny: Well, that’s not gonna happen."
"3","Sheldon: I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here."
"3","Penny: Which is?"
"3","Sheldon: I want you to crawl back to him and apologize."
"3","Penny: I’m busy."
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch."
"3","Penny: Fine. What do you want?"
"3","Sheldon: I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
"3","Penny: Yes."
"3","Sheldon: Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?"
"3","Penny: No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich."
"3","Sheldon: You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich."
"3","Penny: Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course not. I’ll have my usual."
"3","Penny: Great."
"3","Sheldon: Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?"
"3","Penny: Don’t you usually get lemonade?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes."
"3","Penny: Do you want lemonade?"
"3","Penny: Anything else?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard."
"3","Penny: I am not going to apologize. I’ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting."
"3","Sheldon: Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable."
"3","Penny: Well, I’m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn’t about you."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t follow."
"3","Penny: Yeah, yeah, I’ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go."
"3","Sheldon: All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong."
"3","Penny: Leonard is wrong."
"3","Sheldon: Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?"
"3","Penny: I’m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I’ve committed?"
"3","Sheldon: Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?"
"3","Penny: Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you’re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?"
"3","Sheldon: Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing."
"3","Penny: My singing?"
"3","Sheldon: That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it."
"3","Penny: Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?"
"3","Sheldon: Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper."
"3","Penny: Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!"
"3","Sheldon: And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped."
"3","Leonard: Hey."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour."
"3","Leonard: Sure."
"3","Sheldon: Go apologize to Penny."
"3","Sheldon: Right now would be good."
"3","Penny (knocking): Leonard!"
"3","Sheldon: Although, a few minutes ago would have been better."
"3","Penny: I hear you don’t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality."
"3","Leonard: What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?"
"3","Penny: It doesn’t matter why he told me. It’s true, isn’t it?"
"3","Leonard: Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!"
"3","Penny: That isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!"
"3","Leonard: Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?"
"3","Penny: Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
"3","Leonard: Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!"
"3","Penny: No, I’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
"3","Leonard: Why didn’t you say so?"
"3","Penny: Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!"
"3","Leonard: Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!"
"3","Penny: Really? Why not? You’re so smart, and I’m so dumb!"
"3","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj."
"3","Raj: Stop knocking! It’s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can’t come home for my cousin Sanjay’s wedding."
"3","Mrs Koothrappali: Sheldon, ask our son what we’re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him."
"3","Raj: I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi."
"3","Mrs Koothrappali: You should be thanking us!"
"3","Dr Koothrappali: Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up."
"3","Raj: I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?"
"3","Mrs Koothrappali: Because you’re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard."
"3","Raj: Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding."
"3","Scene: Penny’s car."
"3","Penny (out of the window): Sheldon! (whistles)"
"3","Leonard: What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog."
"3","Penny: Hey, why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?"
"3","Leonard: The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t."
"3","Penny: What stop sign?"
"3","Leonard: Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!"
"3","Scene: Outside Howard’s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell."
"3","Howard’s Mother: Howard, answer the door! I’m busy!"
"3","Howard: I’m busy too, you answer it."
"3","Howard’s Mother: I can’t! I’m on the toilet!"
"3","Howard: For God’s sake, I don’t need to hear that! Can’t you just say, I’m busy?"
"3","Howard’s Mother: I said I’m busy, but that wasn’t good enough for you!"
"3","Howard: You know what? I hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head."
"3","Howard’s Mother: Well, if it’s a home invader, don’t tell them I’m on the toilet!"
"3","Howard: There’s no one there. You’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!"
"3","Leonard: Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?"
"3","Stuart: Yeah, he’s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest."
"3","Leonard: Thank you."
"3","Stuart: Uh, Penny?"
"3","Penny: Yeah?"
"3","Stuart: Is everything okay?"
"3","Penny: What do you mean?"
"3","Stuart: Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?"
"3","Penny: Oh, yeah, kind of. It’s, it’s no big thing."
"3","Stuart: Oh, good, good. (She moves away) I love you."
"3","Leonard: I’m not leaving until you talk to me."
"3","Penny: All right, what’s going on?"
"3","Leonard: It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us."
"3","Sheldon: Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you."
"3","Penny: Come on, Sheldon, let’s go home. Look, we’re done fighting."
"3","Sheldon: I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates."
"3","Penny: Okay, there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting."
"3","Sheldon: Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?"
"3","Penny: Oh, my God, would you let this go?!"
"3","Stuart: I’d let it go."
"3","Leonard: Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? (Sheldon turns on a loud toy robot) Oh, for God’s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. (Sheldon turns on another robot)"
"3","Penny: Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let’s just… Sheldon, please,"
"3","try and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we’re going to fight. But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you. Right, Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: Always is a long time. Sure. Always."
"3","Penny: You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?"
"3","Sheldon: I want that one."
"3","Penny: Okay, you can have that one."
"3","Leonard: Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk."
"3","Penny: Buy him the robot, Leonard."
"3","Sheldon: Can I get this comic book, too?"
"3","Penny: Yes, you can."
"3","Stuart: We meet again."
"3","Scene: Penny’s bed."
"3","Leonard: So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?"
"3","Penny: He’s a musician. He’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to."
"3","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is in his spot. Beside him, a long haired bearded person is asleep. There is a guitar propped up on the arm of the sofa."
"3","Sheldon: I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot."
"3","Series 03 Episode 08 – The Adhesive Duck Deficiency"
"3","Scene: A camp site."
"3","Howard: How much time do we have?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower."
"3","Raj: Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93."
"3","Howard: Anything yet?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock."
"3","Howard: Hang on, how about now?"
"3","Raj: We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO."
"3","Howard: Ooh, Real Sex."
"3","Raj: Big deal. Every time I watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers."
"3","Howard: Alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed."
"3","Leonard: Oh, hey. Dune."
"3","Raj: Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert."
"3","Leonard: Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us."
"3","Raj: Yes, it’s not the same without him. (They all laugh)"
"3","Howard: Oh, this sucks, I’m switching back to Real Sex."
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Sheldon: Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. (He laughs)"
"3"," "
"3","Credits sequence."
"3","Sheldon: And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings."
"3","Penny (voice off): Sheldon help!"
"3","Sheldon: I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. (At Penny’s door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.."
"3","Penny: Come in! Hurry!"
"3","Sheldon: Penny?"
"3","Penny: I’m back here."
"3","Sheldon: (At Penny’s bedroom door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.."
"3","Penny: Oh, for god’s sakes, I’m in the bathroom!"
"3","Sheldon: Shall I come back at a better time?"
"3","Penny: Get in here! Hurry! Don’t you dare knock."
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Penny: I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder."
"3","Sheldon: Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction."
"3","Penny: What?"
"3","Sheldon: Tubs are slippery."
"3","Penny: I know. I slipped."
"3","Sheldon: I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub."
"3","Penny: Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?"
"3","Sheldon: They’re holding umbrellas."
"3","Sheldon: The ducks in my tub."
"3","Penny: Uh-huh."
"3","Sheldon: They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas."
"3","Penny: Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room."
"3","Sheldon: Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so."
"3","Penny: Okay, can you drive me?"
"3","Sheldon: I don’t drive."
"3","Penny: Well, I can’t drive!"
"3","Sheldon: Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse."
"3","Penny: Ow."
"3","Sheldon: But I could call you a cab or an ambulance."
"3","Penny: No, no, no, I can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please."
"3","Sheldon: All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress."
"3","Penny: No one’s saying that. Let’s go."
"3","Sheldon: Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash."
"3","Scene: The camp site."
"3","Leonard: I wish Penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping."
"3","Raj: Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus."
"3","Howard: Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation."
"3","Raj: Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?"
"3","Howard: Oh I don’t know, 50, 55."
"3","Raj: Oh, menopause, nature’s birth control."
"3","Leonard: Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up."
"3","Howard: I am."
"3","Raj: Yeah, me, too."
"3","Howard: Look, they gave me homemade cookies."
"3","Leonard: Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do."
"3","Raj: So, what are we waiting for?"
"3","Howard: Relax, I said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap."
"3","Raj: Good idea. They’ll be refreshed."
"3","Howard: Cookie?"
"3","Raj: Yeah, thank you. Mmmm."
"3","Leonard: Mmmm, not bad."
"3","Raj: Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers."
"3","Howard: Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts."
"3","Raj: Huh. Mmm. Good cookies."
"3","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"3","Sheldon: I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?"
"3","Penny: I don’t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt."
"3","Sheldon: My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident."
"3","Penny: One was already in an accident."
"3","Sheldon: That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving."
"3","Penny: Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!"
"3","Sheldon: Okay, here."
"3","Penny: Seriously? Those shorts with that top?"
"3","Sheldon: All right."
"3","Penny: No… No… Oh, that’s cute."
"3","Sheldon: We should have you checked for a concussion."
"3","Penny: Okay, now, you got to help me put these on."
"3","Penny: But don’t look."
"3","Sheldon: Don’t look?"
"3","Penny: I don’t want you to see me naked."
"3","Sheldon: Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice."
"3","Penny: Yeah, great."
"3","Sheldon: They always look. It never ends well."
"3","Penny: Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve."
"3","Sheldon: Ok."
"3","Penny: Is that my arm?"
"3","Sheldon: It doesn’t feel like an arm."
"3","Penny: Then, maybe you should let it go."
"3","Sheldon: All righty."
"3","Leonard: Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
"3","Howard: Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky."
"3","Raj: That’s beautiful, dude. You should… You should write that down before someone steals it."
"3","Howard: So, when do the meteors get here?"
"3","Raj: The meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path."
"3","Leonard: I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down."
"3","Raj: Okay, how’s that?"
"3","Leonard: Better. Thanks."
"3","Howard: Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
"3","Leonard: What’s so funny?"
"3","Raj: It’s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid. (With an American accent) Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
"3","Scene: Penny’s car."
"3","Sheldon: For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle."
"3","Penny: You have your learner’s permit, right?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator."
"3","Penny: Good."
"3","Sheldon: Didn’t work out well."
"3","Penny: All right, can we please go?"
"3","Sheldon: One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?"
"3","Penny: It’s right there."
"3","Sheldon: Where is the passenger side mirror?"
"3","Penny: In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again."
"3","Raj: If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king."
"3","Leonard: I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd."
"3","Howard: I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie."
"3","Raj: I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first."
"3","Leonard: You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it."
"3","Howard: It was my Uncle Murray’s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara’s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen."
"3","Raj: One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch."
"3","Leonard: People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?"
"3","Howard: To this day, I can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie."
"3","Penny: Could you please drive a little faster?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?"
"3","Penny: Nothing. The engine does that sometimes."
"3","Sheldon: That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station."
"3","Penny: No. The light has been on since I bought the car."
"3","Sheldon: All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes."
"3","Penny: It’s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock."
"3","Sheldon: Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately."
"3","Penny: Oh, god, I’m gonna lose the arm."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?"
"3","Sheldon: Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?"
"3","Penny: It’s not soup, it’s courage."
"3","Sheldon: No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup."
"3","Penny: How did you see it? You said you wouldn’t look."
"3","Sheldon: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks."
"3","Howard: Anything?"
"3","Leonard: No. That was the last pudding cup."
"3","Howard: No! What about Slim Jims?"
"3","Leonard: That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?"
"3","Raj: Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time."
"3","Howard: Wait. Wait, wait. So you’re saying we’re out of food?"
"3","Leonard: The only thing in here are blue ice packs."
"3","Raj: I know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops."
"3","Leonard: Oh, god, I am so hungry."
"3","Howard: Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding."
"3","Leonard: Okay."
"3","Scene: The hospital waiting room."
"3","Sheldon: All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury."
"3","Penny: I dislocated my shoulder."
"3","Sheldon: All right. And how did the accident occur?"
"3","Penny: You ready know that."
"3","Sheldon: Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
"3","Penny: No."
"3","Sheldon: Kidney disease?"
"3","Sheldon: Migraines?"
"3","Penny: Getting one."
"3","Sheldon: Are you currently pregnant?"
"3","Sheldon: Are you sure? You look a bit puffy."
"3","Penny: Change migraine to yes."
"3","Sheldon: When was your last menstrual period?"
"3","Penny: Oh, next question."
"3","Sheldon: I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
"3","Penny: Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?"
"3","Sheldon: Episodes of sub psychotic rage."
"3","Penny: Ass."
"3","Sheldon: Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock."
"3","Penny: Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don’t know, comforting?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here."
"3","Penny: Thanks. That’s much better."
"3","Raj: Oh, I’m so hungry!"
"3","Leonard: Will you shut up? We’re all hungry."
"3","Howard: Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos."
"3","Leonard: What kind of score are we looking at?"
"3","Howard: Hot dogs, buns, s’mores, I mean, it’s a freaking 7-11."
"3","Leonard: All right, everyone grab flashlights."
"3","Howard: Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack."
"3","Leonard: Quick, get forks."
"3","Howard: You don’t need forks. It’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands."
"3","Raj: He’s right."
"3","Leonard: I feel like we’re forgetting something important."
"3","Raj: Me, too. But what? (Behind them, the meteor shower has begun)"
"3","Howard: Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?"
"3","Leonard and Raj together: Yes! Yes!"
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"3","Sheldon: Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool."
"3","Penny: Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I’d say that."
"3","Sheldon: Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds."
"3","Penny: You know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs."
"3","Sheldon: That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it."
"3","Penny: Sing “Soft Kitty” to me."
"3","Sheldon: “Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick."
"3","Penny: Injured and drugged is a kind of sick."
"3","Sheldon (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
"3","Penny: Wait, wait. Let’s sing it as a round. I’ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that’s where you come in. I’ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… I’ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty… (Sheldon joins in with the round) little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
"3","Scene: The camp site. Raj is telling a ghost story with the torch on his face."
"3","Raj: …And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin."
"3","Howard: That’s still not funny."
"3","Raj (imitating him): That’s still not funny."
"3","Howard: And she was my second cousin."
"3","Raj (imitating him): And she was my second cousin."
"3","Howard: You’re a real douche."
"3","Raj: Who cares? You slept with your cousin."
"3","Series 03 Episode 09 – The Vengeance Formulation"
"3","Scene: Outside an apartment building."
"3","Howard: So two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “What the heck was all that about?”"
"3","Bernadette: I don’t really get it."
"3","Howard: Well, see, it took two years for the snail to… (she kisses him) not important."
"3","Bernadette: Can I ask you a question?"
"3","Howard: Sure."
"3","Bernadette: Where do you think this is going?"
"3","Howard: To be honest, I was hoping at least second base."
"3","Bernadette: You’re so funny. You’re like a stand-up comedian."
"3","Howard: A Jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new."
"3","Bernadette: Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish."
"3","Howard: No, I was just… never mind."
"3","Bernadette: Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means."
"3","Howard: We do?"
"3","Bernadette: Sex."
"3","Howard: You’re kidding."
"3","Bernadette: But I need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand."
"3","Howard: Okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct answer, right? It’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?"
"3","Bernadette: Maybe you need to think about it a little."
"3","Howard: You know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship."
"3","Bernadette: Call me when you figure it out."
"3","Howard: Three dates means sex? Who knew?"
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Howard: Greetings, homies, homette."
"3","Penny: Why are you back from your date so early?"
"3","Howard: In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more."
"3","Penny: What exactly does that mean?"
"3","Leonard: He struck out."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3"," "
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria."
"3","Howard: Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?"
"3","Raj: Actually, I’ve never had three dates with the same woman."
"3","Leonard: With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates."
"3","Howard: Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?"
"3","Leonard: No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
"3","Sheldon (arriving): I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?"
"3","Leonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates."
"3","Sheldon: I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
"3","Leonard: Never mind, what’s your announcement?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…"
"3","Kripke: Hey, Cooper, I hear you’re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends."
"3","Kripke: My pweasure."
"3","Sheldon: My thank you was not sincere."
"3","Kripke: But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don’t answer, it’s wetowical."
"3","Sheldon: Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that."
"3","Leonard: Are you really going to be on NPR?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy."
"3","Leonard: Very cool, congratulations."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul."
"3","Raj: I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, “Fever 104, आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” That means: “Fever 104, home of the really good current music.” It’s much catchier in Hindi."
"3","Sheldon: All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
"3","Howard: Excuse me, I have a master’s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis."
"3","Sheldon: Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
"3","Leonard: You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it."
"3","Raj: In fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad."
"3","Penny: Hi, guys."
"3","Leonard: Hey."
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Penny: Yo, Raj, talk to me. I’m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven’t you called Bernadette?"
"3","Howard: Did she say something?"
"3","Penny: Yeah, she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?"
"3","Howard: I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I’m not sure she’s my type."
"3","Penny: She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?"
"3","Howard: Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different."
"3","Penny: Different how?"
"3","Howard: Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica."
"3","Penny: Are you high?"
"3","Leonard: You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall."
"3","Howard: Okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be."
"3","Penny: Howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?"
"3","Howard: Hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean I have to."
"3","Leonard: Excuse me, I’m sitting here."
"3","Penny: Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically."
"3","Leonard: Again, I’m right here."
"3","Penny: My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath."
"3","Leonard: I am here, right? You see me."
"3","Howard: Hey, I’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? (To Raj) Yes, you’re delicious caramel, too."
"3","Penny: All right, you know what, I will tell you why it’s wrong…"
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me, may I interject?"
"3","Penny: What?"
"3","Sheldon: Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
"3","Howard: Thank you, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question."
"3","Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing."
"3","Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you’re listening to NPR’s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
"3","Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot."
"3","Scene switches to Sheldon’s office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard."
"3","Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper."
"3","Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira."
"3","Ira: Now, let’s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole."
"3","Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection."
"3","Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole."
"3","Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen."
"3","Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!"
"3","Scene: Howard’s bathroom. He is in the bath."
"3","Howard: So nice you could join me this evening. You’re looking lovely as always."
"3","Katee Sackhoff: Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies."
"3","Howard: Come on, Katee, don’t make it sound so cheap."
"3","Katee: I’m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act."
"3","Howard: Thank you. So, shall we get started?"
"3","Katee: Sure. But can I ask you a question first?"
"3","Howard: You want to play Cylon and colonist?"
"3","Katee: No. I want to know why you’re playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight."
"3","Howard: You mean, Bernadette?"
"3","Katee: No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She’s a wonderful girl and she really likes you."
"3","Howard: I know, but she’s not you."
"3","Katee: I’m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy."
"3","Howard: Really? Tall?"
"3","Katee: Six-four."
"3","Howard: Ouch."
"3","Katee: The point is, you’ve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you’re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth."
"3","Howard’s Mother: Howard! What are you doing in there?"
"3","Howard: I’m taking a bath!"
"3","Howard’s Mother: I hope that’s all you’re doing! We share that tub!"
"3","Howard: Don’t remind me! (Katee has vanished) Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"3","Leonard: How ya doin’, buddy?"
"3","Sheldon: I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?"
"3","Leonard: Come on, it wasn’t that bad."
"3","Sheldon: What do you want?"
"3","Raj (in a munchkin voice): We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you."
"3","Leonard: Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you."
"3","Sheldon: It wasn’t funny."
"3","Raj: I thought it was funny."
"3","Leonard: Raj."
"3","Raj: You laughed."
"3","Sheldon: Did you laugh?"
"3","Leonard: I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back."
"3","Sheldon: I refuse to sink to his level."
"3","Raj: You can’t sink. With all that helium in you, you’re lucky you don’t float away."
"3","Leonard: Are you really admitting defeat?"
"3","Sheldon: I never admit defeat."
"3","Leonard: Good."
"3","Sheldon: However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again."
"3","Leonard: What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?"
"3","Raj: I don’t think that’s possible, dude."
"3","Leonard: You’re not helping."
"3","Raj: I didn’t come to help, I came to mock."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane."
"3","Raj: That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply."
"3","Sheldon: Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke."
"3","Leonard: No, no."
"3","Sheldon: It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy."
"3","Leonard: Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance."
"3","Sheldon: Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not."
"3","Leonard: Let’s keep thinking."
"3","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory. Howard enters."
"3","Penny: Oh, gee, you’re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels."
"3","Howard: Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She’s working today, right?"
"3","Penny: Yes, but I don’t think she wants to see you."
"3","Howard: Why not?"
"3","Penny: Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya."
"3","Bernadette: Hello, Howard."
"3","Howard: Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you."
"3","Bernadette: I can’t now, I’m working."
"3","Howard: This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?"
"3","Bernadette: Is this more comedy that I don’t understand?"
"3","Howard: No. I’m serious. I’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real."
"3","Bernadette: So, this isn’t a joke?"
"3","Howard: No."
"3","Bernadette: Then you’re insane."
"3","Howard: I prefer to think of myself as quirky."
"3","Bernadette: Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t even had sex yet."
"3","Howard: Fair enough. When’s your break?"
"3","Bernadette: Wow. (Walks away)"
"3","Howard: Don’t you just hate when this happens?"
"3","Penny: Wow."
"3","Scene: The apartment kitchen."
"3","Sheldon: All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
"3","Raj: What’s this?"
"3","Sheldon: Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
"3","Raj: Foamy vengeance."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, exactly."
"3","Leonard: This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?"
"3","Sheldon: Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
"3","Raj: Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor."
"3","Sheldon: You flatter me, sir."
"3","Leonard: Let me guess, motion sensors?"
"3","Sheldon: The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha."
"3","Leonard: I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. (Sits down. There is a flatulent noise)"
"3","Sheldon: It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
"3","Raj: Here comes Kripke!"
"3","Leonard: Who is that with him?"
"3","Raj: I believe that’s the president of the university."
"3","Leonard: And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!"
"3","Sheldon: There is no abort."
"3","Raj: Well, how could you not put in an abort?"
"3","Sheldon: I made a boo-boo, all right?"
"3","Kripke: I think the board will weally appweciate how well we’re using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma… (foam falls from the ceiling soaking everyone)"
"3","Raj: Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day."
"3","Leonard: At least they don’t know it was you."
"3","Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab): Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise."
"3","Raj: Well, I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?"
"3","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory."
"3","Penny: Hey, here’s your tip from table seven."
"3","Bernadette: Oh, thanks."
"3","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"3","Howard (on the stage, into a microphone): Testing. Check. Check two."
"3","Bernadette: Oh, now what?"
"3","Penny: You want me to throw him out?"
"3","Bernadette: No, that’s okay."
"3","Penny: Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him."
"3","Howard: I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I’ve done wrong. (To the tune of the Four Tops song Bernadette) Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette…"
"3","Penny: Oh, I am so sorry."
"3","Bernadette: Are you kidding? That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me."
"3","Howard (still singing): …Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!"

"3","Scene: The apartment"
"3","Penny: Hey, Leonard, check this out. (Throws some food in the air and catches it in her mouth)"
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, she’s doing it again."
"3","Leonard: I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food."
"3","Sheldon: No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India."
"3","Penny: You want me to put it back?"
"3","Sheldon: Leonard."
"3","Leonard: It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon."
"3","Howard (arriving): What’s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette."
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Howard: Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette."
"3","Leonard: Yeah. Hey."
"3","Howard: Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles."
"3","Bernadette: I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street cred."
"3","Howard: I hope it’s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner."
"3","Leonard: Sure. The more, the merrier."
"3","Sheldon: Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon…"
"3","Sheldon: Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six."
"3","Penny: Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
"3","Leonard: Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys."
"3","Everyone: NO!"
"3","Bernadette: What?"
"3","Penny: Oh, yeah, you can’t sit there."
"3","Bernadette: Why not?"
"3","Leonard: That’s where Sheldon sits."
"3","Bernadette: He can’t sit somewhere else?"
"3","Penny: Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted."
"3","Sheldon: Perhaps there’s hope for you after all."
"3","Credits sequence."

"3","Scene: A few moments later."
"3","Bernadette: Ooh, I love your shoes."
"3","Penny: Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren’t they?"
"3","Bernadette: Where’d you get them?"
"3","Penny: Shoes for Less."
"3","Bernadette: I’ve been meaning to go over there."
"3","Penny: Oh, great selection, great prices."
"3","Sheldon: My mother was right. Hell is real."
"3","Howard: Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat."
"3","Penny: Womenfolk?"
"3","Howard: Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?"
"3","Penny: Just eat your dinner."
"3","Bernadette: Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour."
"3","Penny: Yeah, well, I don’t think it’s very funny."
"3","Bernadette: Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh."
"3","Penny: Howard, never let her go."
"3","Bernadette: So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics."
"3","Leonard: I am. Are you interested in physics?"
"3","Bernadette: Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing."
"3","Leonard: Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
"3","Bernadette: That’s amazing."
"3","Sheldon: Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. (Raj whispers to him) While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
"3","Bernadette: Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?"
"3","Leonard: Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
"3","Bernadette: Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast."
"3","Sheldon: Howard?"
"3","Howard: Yeah?"
"3","Sheldon: Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?"
"3","Howard: What?"
"3","Sheldon: Bazinga. I don’t care."
"3","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon and Raj are playing a racing game on the Wii."
"3","Raj: Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber."
"3","Sheldon: That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree."
"3","Raj: And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive."
"3","Sheldon: Just need a little more practice."
"3","Raj: What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart."
"3","Penny (knocking and entering): Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again."
"3","Penny: It’s not about shoes."
"3","Sheldon: Then speak."
"3","Penny: Um, actually, can we do it in private?"
"3","Sheldon: All right. (To Raj) Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy."
"3","Penny: Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?"
"3","Sheldon: A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
"3","Penny: Yeah, okay, cool. I don’t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does."
"3","Sheldon: Why can’t Leonard teach you?"
"3","Penny: ‘Cause I want to surprise him."
"3","Sheldon: Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
"3","Penny: Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me."
"3","Sheldon: Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
"3","Penny: You’re sitting here playing video games all day."
"3","Sheldon: Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?"
"3","Penny: Sure. I did the one with the frogs."
"3","Sheldon: The one with the frogs."
"3","Penny: Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer."
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so."
"3","Penny: Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment."
"3","Sheldon: Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics."
"3","Penny: Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo."
"3","Sheldon: Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes."
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria."
"3","Howard: Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette."
"3","Bernadette: Who are all those people?"
"3","Howard: Have no idea. Hey, Leonard."
"3","Bernadette: Hi."
"3","Leonard: Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette."
"3","Howard: Thought I’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines."
"3","Bernadette: He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he works."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, no, I got it."
"3","Bernadette: So, how’s your experiment going?"
"3","Leonard: Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow."
"3","Bernadette: Boy, I’d love to see that."
"3","Leonard: You’re welcome to come."
"3","Bernadette: Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?"
"3","Howard: Like Hanukkah in July."
"3","Bernadette: Do they have that?"
"3","Howard: No."
"3","Bernadette: Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me."
"3","Howard: Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?"
"3","Bernadette: Sure."
"3","Howard: Thanks, honey. (She goes) All right, what is your deal?"
"3","Leonard: Excuse me?"
"3","Howard: Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah? So?"
"3","Howard: Wow! You really are a piece of work. It’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?"
"3","Leonard: What are you talking about?"
"3","Howard: Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women."
"3","Leonard: Has it ever worked?"
"3","Howard: Not so far, but that’s not the point!"
"3","Leonard: Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend."
"3","Howard: I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m crazy."
"3","Leonard: I believe you."
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Sheldon: Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla."
"3","Penny: Hey, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting."
"3","Penny: Ready to get started?"
"3","Sheldon: One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?"
"3","Penny: Um, I don’t have one."
"3","Sheldon: How are you going to take notes without a notebook?"
"3","Penny: I have to take notes?"
"3","Sheldon: How else are you gonna study for the tests?"
"3","Penny: There’s gonna be a test?"
"3","Sheldon: Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating."
"3","Penny: Thank you."
"3","Sheldon: You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins."
"3","Penny: Ancient Greece?"
"3","Sheldon: Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?"
"3","Penny: Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?"
"3","Sheldon: This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off."
"3","Penny: Twenty six hundred years?"
"3","Sheldon: Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?"
"3","Penny: I have to go to the bathroom."
"3","Sheldon: Can’t you hold it?"
"3","Penny: Not for twenty six hundred years."
"3","Sheldon: Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted."
"3","Scene: Howard’s bedroom."
"3","Bernadette: Howard?"
"3","Howard: Huh?"
"3","Bernadette: It unhooks in the front."
"3","Howard: Oh, that explains a lot."
"3","Howard’s Mother: Howard, I’m home!"
"3","Howard: Of course."
"3","Howard’s Mother: Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I’m fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel."
"3","Howard: That’s great, Ma!"
"3","Howard’s Mother: What’s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?"
"3","Bernadette: I guess I should go."
"3","Howard: No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?"
"3","Howard’s Mother: Lamb stew? I’d have to go to the supermarket."
"3","Howard: Please? I got a real hankering."
"3","Howard’s Mother: Oh, I can’t say no to my little tushy face. I’ll be back soon."
"3","Howard: Thanks, Ma."
"3","Howard’s Mother: Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?"
"3","Howard: Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!"
"3","Howard’s Mother: You’re right! When you’re right, you’re right! What if they’re out of the Le Seur?"
"3","Howard: Then get the regular!"
"3","Howard’s Mother: All right! You don’t have to yell!"
"3","Howard: Sorry about that."
"3","Bernadette (her phone chimes): Let me just put that on vibrate."
"3","Howard: I’m already on vibrate."
"3","Bernadette: You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?"
"3","Howard: Uh, what do you mean?"
"3","Bernadette: He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out."
"3","Howard: Really? He said that?"
"3","Bernadette: You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?"
"3","Howard: Me? No. I may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man."
"3","Bernadette: Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?"
"3","Howard: I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission. (Bernadette storms out) Come on, I don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra."
"3","Sheldon: Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?"
"3","Penny: Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?"
"3","Sheldon: No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!"
"3","Penny: Sorry."
"3","Sheldon: Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?"
"3","Penny: I don’t know."
"3","Sheldon: How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?"
"3","Penny: Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry. (Smiling) Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?"
"3","Penny: No, you just suck at teaching."
"3","Sheldon: Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
"3","Penny: Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?"
"3","Sheldon: All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…"
"3","Penny: Not that far back!"
"3","Sheldon: Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?"
"3","Penny: I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?"
"3","Sheldon: Greece."
"3","Penny: Damn it!"
"3","Sheldon: There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?"
"3","Penny: Squared?"
"3","Sheldon: No."
"3","Penny: Aristotle?"
"3","Penny: Five?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh!"
"3","Penny: Then I don’t know."
"3","Sheldon: Why are you crying?"
"3","Penny: Because I’m stupid!"
"3","Sheldon: That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
"3","Penny: Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?"
"3","Sheldon: All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do."
"3","Penny: Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated."
"3","Sheldon: It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it."
"3","Penny: Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?"
"3","Sheldon: A good question."
"3","Sheldon: And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
"3","Penny: Oh, balls."
"3","Sheldon: It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…"
"3","Scene: Leonard’s lab."
"3","Howard: Okay, I got a bone to pick with you."
"3","Leonard: What did I do now?"
"3","Howard: I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me."
"3","Leonard: What?"
"3","Howard: We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you."
"3","Leonard: You do have a problem with her hanging out with me."
"3","Howard: Yeah, but that’s not what you tell her."
"3","Leonard: What was I supposed to tell her?"
"3","Howard: I don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche."
"3","Leonard: And what would that be?"
"3","Howard: Come on, do I have to think of everything?"
"3","Bernadette: Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi."
"3","Howard: Hi."
"3","Bernadette: What are you doing here?"
"3","Howard: Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s experiment."
"3","Bernadette: No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was stupid."
"3","Leonard: You told her my experiment was stupid?"
"3","Howard: I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let’s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with."
"3","Leonard: Should I, um, leave you two alone?"
"3","Bernadette: No, Leonard, you should hear this."
"3","Leonard: Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go."
"3","Howard: Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I’m not."
"3","Leonard: We’re shocked."
"3","Howard: Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys."
"3","Leonard: Or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
"3","Howard: But I now realize how foolish that is."
"3","Leonard: He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater."
"3","Howard: It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?"
"3","Howard: Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another chance."
"3","Bernadette: What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?"
"3","Leonard: It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid."
"3","Bernadette: Come here, tushy face."
"3","Leonard: Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now."
"3","Bernadette: Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on."
"3","Leonard: I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do."
"3","Penny: Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist."

"3","Sheldon: No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was."
"3","Leonard: When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun."
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account."
"3","Leonard (continuing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3"," "
"3","Penny: I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again."
"3","Leonard: We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up."
"3","Penny: Really? Why not?"
"3","Leonard: Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society."
"3","Penny: Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?"
"3","Leonard: Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures."
"3","Penny: So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree."
"3","Sheldon: I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this."
"3","Penny: What is it?"
"3","Sheldon: You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton."
"3","Penny: Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy."
"3","Sheldon: Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree."
"3","Leonard: Here we go."
"3","Sheldon: December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."
"3","Leonard: Merry Newton-mas, everyone."
"3","Sheldon: I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why."
"3","Penny: No, it’s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane."
"3","Sheldon: No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree."
"3","Leonard: No, he doesn’t."
"3","Sheldon: I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man."
"3","Sheldon: Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you."
"3","Penny: What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?"
"3","Leonard: Tomorrow."
"3","Penny: When were you going to tell me?"
"3","Leonard: Um, tomorrow?"
"3","Penny: Why were you keeping this a secret?"
"3","Leonard: Well, I just, I thought…"
"3","Sheldon: If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate."
"3","Penny: Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable."
"3","Leonard: You are, it’s just…"
"3","Sheldon: If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu."
"3","Penny: Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts."
"3","Leonard: I know. And those specials, they change every day."
"3","Penny: Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on."
"3","Leonard: Okay, sorry."
"3","Penny: So what did she say when you told her we were going out?"
"3","Leonard: Um…"
"3","Penny: You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?"
"3","Penny: Why not?"
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om."
"3","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"3","Beverley: It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up."
"3","Sheldon: No trouble at all."
"3","Leonard: I drove, Mother. I’m driving now."
"3","Beverley: Yes, dear. Mommy’s proud. I’ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory."
"3","Sheldon: My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate."
"3","Leonard: Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?"
"3","Sheldon: August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery."
"3","Beverley: Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?"
"3","Sheldon: You did."
"3","Beverley: I don’t really like flowers."
"3","Sheldon: Neither do I, but it’s the social convention."
"3","Beverley: It is, isn’t it?"
"3","Leonard: Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?"
"3","Beverley: Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers."
"3","Leonard: No, I heard that."
"3","Beverley: Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?"
"3","Leonard: I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do."
"3","Beverley: Well, I would assume it’s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues."
"3","Sheldon: It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling."
"3","Beverley: Yes, but we are on the subject, so I’m obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?"
"3","Leonard: Fine, Mom. How are you?"
"3","Beverley: Mmm, menopausal."
"3","Leonard: Now I’m less fine."
"3","Beverley: Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?"
"3","Leonard: No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?"
"3","Sheldon: My bad. I did send a gift from both of us."
"3","Beverley: She’s a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist."
"3","Leonard: You must be very happy."
"3","Beverley: Why? I’m not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…"
"3","Leonard: Not the time, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?"
"3","Beverley: It’s all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard’s not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate."
"3","Sheldon: Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you."
"3","Beverley: So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?"
"3","Howard: What? No."
"3","Beverley: Why not?"
"3","Howard: Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another."
"3","Beverley: I see."
"3","Howard: No, really. I have a girlfriend now."
"3","Beverley: And where is she this evening?"
"3","Howard: She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died."
"3","Beverley: I see. Her grandmother died."
"3","Howard: Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend."
"3","Leonard: I don’t know what you’re talking about."
"3","Howard: What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!"
"3","Leonard: All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”"
"3","Howard: Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist."
"3","Beverley: Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you’re hurting your partner."
"3","Howard (to Raj who has whispered to him): Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?"
"3","Penny (arriving): Hi. Sorry I’m late."
"3","Leonard: Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny."
"3","Beverley: Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?"
"3","Penny: Well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas, so I’m going to say no."
"3","Howard: If it helps, we’re all good with your breasts."
"3","Beverley: Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I’m divorcing yours."
"3","Leonard: What?"
"3","Beverley: Yes. He was cheating on me."
"3","Leonard: No!"
"3","Beverley: Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear."
"3","Penny: No, it sounded like a compliment."
"3","Leonard: When did this happen?"
"3","Beverley: Mmm, well, let’s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard’s father?"
"3","Sheldon: September 22nd."
"3","Beverley: Oh, yes, that’s right. The weekend after Leonard’s dog died."
"3","Leonard: Mitzy’s dead?"
"3","Sheldon: She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?"
"3","Beverley: Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who’s getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?"
"3","Leonard: You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!"
"3","Beverley: So, Penny, what’s new in your life?"
"3","Penny: Nothing. Not a damn thing."
"3","Scene: Penny’s car."
"3","Beverley: Thank you for driving me back to my hotel."
"3","Penny: Oh, it’s not a problem."
"3","Beverley: I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don’t want someone like that operating heavy machinery."
"3","Penny: No, you do not."
"3","Beverley: Your check engine light is on."
"3","Penny: Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce."
"3","Beverley: Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that’s not subjected to regular maintenance."
"3","Penny: Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?"
"3","Beverley: Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that’s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch."
"3","Penny: Sure, sure."
"3","Beverley: Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven’t had intercourse with him in eight years."
"3","Penny: Eight years?"
"3","Beverley: Oh, that’s nothing. I’ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982."
"3","Penny: Yikes. What’s so funny?"
"3","Beverley: That’s exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes."
"3","Penny: You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?"
"3","Beverley: Oh, I don’t drink."
"3","Penny: I do, I’ll teach you."
"3","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: What is it?
Sheldon: I made tea."
"3","Leonard: I don’t want tea."
"3","Sheldon: I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea."
"3","Leonard: Then why are you telling me?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s a conversation starter."
"3","Leonard: That’s a lousy conversation starter."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate."
"3","Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?"
"3","Sheldon: What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five."
"3","Leonard: I want that too. Why are you here?"
"3","Sheldon: To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
"3","Leonard: Thank you, that’s very comforting."
"3","Sheldon: That’s not the comforting part."
"3","Leonard: It’s not?"
"3","Sheldon: No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."
"3","Leonard: You’re right, I do feel better."
"3","Sheldon: Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family."
"3","Leonard: You’re my surrogate family?"
"3","Sheldon: If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night."
"3","Scene: A bar."
"3","Penny: Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once."
"3","Beverley: Yikes."
"3","Penny: I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl."
"3","Beverley: I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities."
"3","Penny: As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine."
"3","Beverley: Oh, that is fascinating. I’m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I’m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?"
"3","Penny: Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again."
"3","Beverley: Yes. If a little is good, more must be better."
"3","Penny: Hey, Bev, guess what?"
"3","Beverley: What?"
"3","Penny: I’m sleeping with your son."
"3","Beverley: Really? Which one?"
"3","Penny: The one from whom I live across the hall from."
"3","Beverley: Well, that’s convenient. How did his penis turn out?"
"3","Penny: Oh, Beverly, I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis."
"3","Beverley: Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy’s penis?"
"3","Penny: Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating."
"3","Beverley: Really? Well, that means he’s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn’t care enough about his mother to tell her he’s in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted."
"3","Penny: Well, let’s go find out who."
"3","Beverley: You go get a taxi. I’m gonna slip my business card into that busboy’s back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so."
"3","Penny: Leonard?"
"3","Beverley: Sonny boy!"
"3","Penny: Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!"
"3","Leonard: What the hell is going on?"
"3","Penny: You’re in trouble."
"3","Beverley: Why didn’t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?"
"3","Penny: Yeah, not bad, not bad."
"3","Leonard: Are you guys drunk?"
"3","Beverley: Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?"
"3","Penny: Oh, thank you."
"3","Beverley: You’re welcome. Is it because she’s uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?"
"3","Penny: What the hell happened to lovely and charming?"
"3","Leonard: How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?"
"3","Beverley: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship."
"3","Leonard: I do."
"3","Beverley (gives him an uncomfortable hug): There. It’s late. Now, go to bed. I’m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart."
"3","Penny: That’s the Del Taco."
"3","Sheldon: Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?"
"3","Beverley: Speaking of warm feelings, come here. (She grabs Sheldon and kisses him) No, I’d rather have the busboy."
"3","Beverley: Thank you for taking me to the airport."
"3","Sheldon: You’re very welcome."
"3","Leonard: Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here."
"3","Beverley: Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you’ll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated."
"3","Beverley: Thank you."
"3","Sheldon: I blame Penny."
"3","Penny: I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny."
"3","Leonard: Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?"
"3","Beverley: I think it’s best that you not know."
"3","Sheldon: Agreed."
"3","Penny: Agreed."
"3","Leonard: What the hell, agreed."
"3","Beverley: And I want you to take very good care of this young woman."
"3","Penny: Oh, thank you, Beverly."
"3","Beverley: You’re welcome. She doesn’t have much in the way of career prospects, don’t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well."
"3","Leonard: Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?"
"3","Beverley: Yes, dear."
"3","Leonard: I’m over it."
"3","Penny (finishing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la."
"3","Series 03 Episode 12 – The Psychic Vortex"
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Leonard: Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends."
"3","Howard: Yes, actual women are the best."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?"
"3","Leonard: Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?"
"3","Howard: No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection."
"3","Leonard: What are you trying to tell me, Howard?"
"3","Howard: There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too."
"3","Leonard: Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar."
"3","Raj (arriving): Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen."
"3","Leonard: Got it."
"3","Howard: Seen it."
"3","Sheldon: Detailed analysis posted online."
"3","Raj: Well, then what are we going to do tonight?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette."
"3","Howard: Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled."
"3","Leonard: How did we get actual women?"
"3","Raj: Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?"
"3","Sheldon: It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us."
"3","Raj: We do?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
"3","Raj: I don’t want to do that."
"3","Sheldon: All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
"3","Raj: What about me?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3","Scene: A little later."
"3","Raj: Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot."
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s."
"3","Raj: Race riots?"
"3","Sheldon: The zoot suit riots."
"3","Raj: Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?"
"3","Sheldon: I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?"
"3","Raj: No. We would just walk around and see what’s what."
"3","Sheldon: That’s a semantically null sentence."
"3","Raj: Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be."
"3","Sheldon: Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest."
"3","Raj: Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good."
"3","Sheldon: If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?"
"3","Raj: I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff."
"3","Sheldon: Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination."
"3","Raj: Oh, boy."
"3","Sheldon: One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland."
"3","Raj: I don’t want to go to Flatland."
"3","Sheldon: You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects."
"3","Raj: Oy."
"3","Sheldon: Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge."
"3","Raj: Sheldon, I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don’t want to go alone."
"3","Sheldon: Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up."
"3","Raj: What?"
"3","Sheldon: Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles."
"3","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"3","Leonard: I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant."
"3","Bernadette: Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite."
"3","Howard: Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?"
"3","Penny: That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?"
"3","Bernadette: Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?"
"3","Howard: Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are."
"3","Bernadette: How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?"
"3","Penny: Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon."
"3","Leonard: Great. How come?"
"3","Penny: Well, promise you won’t make fun of me."
"3","Leonard: Of course, I would never make fun of you."
"3","Penny: Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial."
"3","Leonard (laughing): Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?"
"3","Howard: Good job not making fun of her."
"3","Penny: She’s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site."
"3","Leonard: Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site."
"3","Penny: Why are you being such a jerk?"
"3","Leonard: You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?"
"3","Penny: Ha-ha, bite me."
"3","Leonard: Come on, Penny."
"3","Howard: Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here."
"3","Bernadette: I’m sliding into third."
"3","Scene: The university mixer."
"3","Raj: Thanks for coming with me."
"3","Sheldon: Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern."
"3","Raj: Did you really have to bring it in with you?"
"3","Sheldon: What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?"
"3","Raj: Come on, let’s get a drink."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t drink."
"3","Raj: Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw."
"3","Sheldon: I would like a root beer float."
"3","Raj: Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream."
"3","Sheldon: They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party."
"3","Raj: He’ll have a Shirley Temple."
"3","Sheldon: And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley."
"3","Raj: Okay, let’s check out the females."
"3","Sheldon: All right. There’s a female."
"3","Raj: That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old."
"3","Sheldon: But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?"
"3","Raj: No. I’m looking for a hookup."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?"
"3","Raj: Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?"
"3","Raj: You help me run my game."
"3","Sheldon: Okay. What is your game?"
"3","Sheldon: When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
"3","Girl: Hey, that’s pretty cool. What is it?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with."
"3","Girl: You’re very funny. I’m Abby."
"3","Sheldon: I’m Sheldon. How do you do?"
"3","Raj: How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj."
"3","Abby: Hi, Raj. Where are you from?"
"3","Raj: The mysterious subcontinent of India."
"3","Abby: Ooh, India."
"3","Raj: You know India?"
"3","Abby: I saw Slumdog Millionaire."
"3","Raj: Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist."
"3","Sheldon: I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry. (Smiles and nods)"
"3","Abby: Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha."
"3","Martha: Hi."
"3","Raj: Hello."
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Martha: Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?"
"3","Sheldon: In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight."
"3","Martha: Oh, that is so awesome."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?"
"3","Scene: A restaurant."
"3","Bernadette: So, what should we talk about?"
"3","Howard: Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?"
"3","Penny: Oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car."
"3","Leonard: I’m sorry, but facts are facts."
"3","Penny: Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact."
"3","Leonard: No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact."
"3","Penny: Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me."
"3","Leonard: You’re welcome. How’s your fish?"
"3","Penny: Amazing. Would you like to try some?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, sure."
"3","Penny: Well, the fact is, you can’t."
"3","Leonard: Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here."
"3","Howard: What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?"
"3","Bernadette: No, thank you."
"3","Howard: Sorry."
"3","Leonard: Maybe we should just stop talking about this."
"3","Penny: Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether."
"3","Waiter: How is everything tonight?"
"3","Bernadette: Really uncomfortable."

"3","Leonard: You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… (she shuts the door in his face) Want your fish? (Opens door, takes fish, closes it again) I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. (Opens his own apartment door to find Sheldon, Raj and the two girls playing Rock Band and performing American Woman)"
"3","Leonard: What’s going on?"

"3","Scene: Leonard’s lab."
"3","Howard: Hey."
"3","Leonard (handing him protective glasses): Laser."
"3","Howard: Had a great night last night. I don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base."
"3","Leonard: What the hell is eighth base?"
"3","Howard: Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How’d things go with Penny?"
"3","Leonard: Oh, couldn’t be better."
"3","Howard: Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?"
"3","Leonard: It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next."
"3","Howard: All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon."
"3","Leonard: How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?"
"3","Howard: Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens."
"3","Leonard: And that didn’t bother you?"
"3","Howard: Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing."
"3","Leonard: What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?"
"3","Howard: Hey, I’m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you."
"3","Leonard: Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
"3","Howard: Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the"

"3","Leonard: What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard."
"3","Howard: I respect that. (Takes Leonard’s hand, draws a dot on it.)"
"3","Leonard: What is that?"
"3","Howard: Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight."
"3","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is learning Finnish."
"3","Sheldon: The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet. (There is a knock on the door) One minute. Sis n."
"3","Raj: What was that?"
"3","Sheldon: It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish."
"3","Raj: जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?"
"3","Sheldon: I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane."
"3","Raj: I don’t get it. You had a great time."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again."
"3","Raj: Please, Sheldon, I’m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha."
"3","Sheldon: Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider."
"3","Raj: My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years."
"3","Raj: So does that mean we can go with the girls again?"
"3","Sheldon: Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!"
"3","Raj: You can’t wear the hands on the date."
"3","Sheldon: Hulk sad."
"3","Scene: The laundry room."
"3","Leonard: Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you."
"3","Penny: Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?"
"3","Leonard: No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in."
"3","Penny: Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?"
"3","Leonard: Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?"
"3","Penny: I would not."
"3","Leonard: Okay, let’s go see your psychic."
"3","Penny: Really?"
"3","Leonard: Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
"3","Penny: You saying I don’t have an open mind?"
"3","Leonard: No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff."
"3","Penny: You know, I believe in ghosts, too."
"3","Leonard: Great."
"3","Penny: And astrology."
"3","Leonard: I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals."
"3","Penny: Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work."
"3","Leonard: Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?"
"3","Penny: Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo."
"3","Martha: Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores."
"3","Sheldon: You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late."
"3","Martha: Uh-huh."
"3","Sheldon: Time for bed."
"3","Martha: Okay."
"3","Sheldon: Good night, puny human! (He gets up and leaves)."
"3","Scene: Outside Sheldon’s bedroom."
"3","Martha: Sheldon?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes?"
"3","Martha: Listen, they’re kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while."
"3","Sheldon: Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night."

"3","Howard: Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys."
"3","Raj: Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now."
"3","Howard: A little jealous, are we?"
"3","Raj: No, I’m not jealous. All right, I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now, can we order?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu."
"3","Leonard: So what? It’s the same food."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken."
"3","Raj: So?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes, General Tso."
"3","Raj: Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?"
"3","Sheldon: So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?"
"3","Leonard: It’s obviously a typo."
"3","Sheldon: Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters."
"3","Raj: No, no, no, no, I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like."
"3","Howard: It doesn’t mean any of that! It’s a typo."
"3","Leonard: You know what? Let’s just get a pizza."
"3","Sheldon: Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s."
"3","Howard: Sure, no mobsters there."
"3","Scene: The stairwell."
"3","Sheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster."
"3","Leonard: And why is that?"
"3","Sheldon: It was listed under seafood."
"3","Leonard: What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?"
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
"3","Leonard (noticing their door has been broken open): What the…?"
"3","Sheldon: The TV is gone."
"3","Leonard: So are our laptops."
"3","Sheldon: Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books."

"3","Leonard: We like games."
"3","Sheldon: Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman."
"3","Policeman: Assorted video games."
"3","Sheldon: When does the CSI team get here?"
"3","Policeman: What?"
"3","Sheldon: In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect."
"3","Leonard: What about me?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job."
"3","Leonard: Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?"
"3","Policeman: I’d be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold."
"3","Sheldon: I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested."
"3","Policeman: We’re done here. Call this number, and we’ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company."
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?"
"3","Policeman: Do you have any more information that might be relevant?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem."
"3","Leonard: How is that going to help them?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."
"3","Policeman: Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco."
"3","Leonard: What are we supposed to do now?"
"3","Sheldon: The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep."
"3","Leonard: Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, how I wish I could."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon is restless. He gets up and checks the door is locked. He then moves his chest of drawers in front of the door. Goes back to bed."
"3","Sheldon: I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat."
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"3","Penny: I can’t believe it. If I hadn’t been working the dinner shift, I would’ve run"

"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
"3","Leonard: Hand me the bat."
"3","Sheldon: We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
"3","Penny: It won’t happen again, what’s up?"
"3","Sheldon: Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay."
"3","Leonard: We’re fine, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: All right, then. Good night."
"3","Penny: Good night. That was weird, even for him."
"3","Leonard: Mm-hmm."
"3","Penny: Who is it?"
"3","Sheldon: Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper."
"3","Penny: Yes?"
"3","Sheldon: May I come in?"
"3","Penny: Yeah."
"3","Sheldon: I see you’re drinking wine."
"3","Leonard: Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed."
"3","Sheldon: Uh-huh."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch."
"3","Leonard: What do you want?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support."
"3","Leonard: But you don’t like other people."
"3","Sheldon: I do tonight. It’s scary over there."
"3","Leonard: It’s getting scary here, too."

"3","Penny: Um… three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don’t know. Star Wars?"
"3","Leonard: Did we win? Can we go to bed?"

"3","Penny: Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep."
"3","Sheldon: All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400."
"3","Leonard: Great. Good night."
"3","Penny: Wait, wait, what’s 0400?"
"3","Leonard: 4am."
"3","Penny: That’s, like, in 45 minutes."
"3","Leonard: Just keep walking. (Sheldon checks door then puts TV on his phone)"
"3","Woman on TV: It’s quiet out there."
"3","Man on TV: Maybe a little too quiet."
"3","Woman on TV: Where are you going?"
"3","Man on TV: Just gonna take a look around outside."
"3","Sheldon: Bad idea."
"3","Woman on TV: No, Jim, don’t open the door!"
"3","Sheldon: Listen to her, Jim."
"3","Man on TV: Don’t worry, there’s no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard’s room.)"
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny!"
"3","Leonard: Who is it?"
"3","Scene: Outside the apartment."
"3","Howard: All right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system."
"3","Sheldon: What if they cut the power?"
"3","Raj: There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply."
"3","Sheldon: What if someone steals my keys?"
"3","Raj: There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners."
"3","Sheldon: What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?"
"3","Leonard: I’ll send them a basket of muffins."
"3","Howard: Now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software."
"3","Leonard: Where did you get all this stuff?"
"3","Howard: I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence."
"3","Leonard: He just gave it to you?"
"3","Howard: I’m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn’t all that good."
"3","Penny (entering): Raj, your car is blocking me… (A wire net falls on her, while a computer voice repeats the words “Intruder Alert”) What the hell?"
"3","Leonard: Sorry, let me help you."
"3","Sheldon: Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna."
"3","Howard: Don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably."
"3","Sheldon: Better."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"3","Sheldon: Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. (Hears a noise. Goes to check, then panics and climbs out window onto ledge.) Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. (Crawls along to Leonard’s window, where Leonard and Penny are inside being intimate. Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
"3","Penny: Oh, my…"
"3","Leonard: God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?"
"3","Sheldon: I heard a noise."
"3","Leonard: It was us. We knocked over a lamp."
"3","Sheldon: Why would you knock over a lamp?"
"3","Leonard: We were going to have…"
"3","Penny: He doesn’t need to know what we were doing, Leonard."
"3","Sheldon: Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. (Starts to climb back out of window)"
"3","Leonard: What are you doing? Use the door."
"3","Sheldon: Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk."
"3","Leonard: Great, you do that."
"3","Sheldon: Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?"
"3","Leonard: I’m lactose intolerant."
"3","Sheldon: And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?"
"3","Penny: No, thanks."
"3","Sheldon: Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss."
"3","Leonard: Sorry about that."
"3","Penny: Ugh, what can you do? Here. (From outside there is the sound of the net falling and computer voice saying “Intruder alert.” Then Sheldon screaming. They run out to find Sheldon convulsing under the net.)"
"3","Leonard: Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, are you okay?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder."
"3","Sheldon: My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that."
"3","Leonard: Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?"
"3","Sheldon: Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting."
"3","Penny: Come on, Sheldon, you can’t move. Don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid."
"3","Penny: Is he quitting his job at the university?"
"3","Leonard: Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it."
"3","Sheldon: All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?"
"3","Penny: Born and raised. (Sheldon crosses Nebraska off his map)"
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon is packing."
"3","Sheldon: It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail."
"3","Leonard: Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?"
"3","Sheldon: I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there."
"3","Howard: Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you."
"3","Sheldon: I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite."
"3","Leonard: They call themselves Bozites?"
"3","Sheldon: They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to miss you."
"3","Sheldon: Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video."
"3","Sheldon on laptop screen: Greetings. As you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, that’s so… (Turns to find he has gone.)"
"3","Sheldon (entering again): You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn’t Bozeman."
"3","Howard (after Raj whispers to him): How the hell do I know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?"
"3","Scene: Bozeman, Montana bus depot."
"3","Sheldon: That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!"
"3","Man: Help you with your bags, sir?"
"3","Sheldon: Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please."

"3","Howard: Hey, look who’s back!"
"3","Sheldon: Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me."

"3","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is stood in the middle of the room. His whiteboard is behind him. Every few moments he turns round suddently."
"3","Penny: Whatcha doing?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain."
"3","Penny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?"
"3","Sheldon: Is it morning?"
"3","Penny: Yes."
"3","Sheldon: Then I’ve been up all night."
"3","Penny: And you’re stuck?"
"3","Sheldon: Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?"
"3","Penny: Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee."
"3","Leonard: Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment."
"3","Penny: What is he doing now?"
"3","Leonard: Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off."
"3","Sheldon: Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight."
"3","Leonard: Aye, aye, Captain."
"3","Sheldon: I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce."
"3","Leonard: Maybe you need a fresh start."
"3","Sheldon: You’re right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3","Scene: The cafeteria."
"3","Sheldon: Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…"
"3","Howard: How long has he been stuck?"
"3","Leonard: Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years."
"3","Sheldon: Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees."
"3","Howard: Have you tried rebooting him?"
"3","Leonard: No, I think it’s a firmware problem."
"3","Raj (arriving): Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?"
"3","Howard: Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating."
"3","Leonard: I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double."
"3","Howard: What could be better? We’re in."
"3","Raj: Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go."
"3","Howard: You can come with us."
"3","Raj: No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com."
"3","Sheldon: Structure, constant structure. One atom…"
"3","Howard: Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
"3","Howard: I thought I smelled popcorn."
"3","Sheldon: Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…"
"3","Leonard: I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie."
"3","Raj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate): Hey, those are my lima beans!"
"3","Sheldon: Not lima beans, carbon atoms."
"3","Raj: But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie."
"3","Leonard: Here, you want my peas?"
"3","Sheldon: Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons."
"3","Howard: Want my corn?"
"3","Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?"
"3","Leonard: So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?"
"3","Howard: Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons."
"3","Leonard: Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?"
"3","Howard: Not this time, I promise."
"3","Raj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes."
"3","Sheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges."
"3","Raj: Screw you. Give me back my lima beans."
"3","Scene: The stairwell."
"3","Bernadette: Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?"
"3","Penny: Not recently."
"3","Bernadette: I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing."
"3","Penny: For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them."
"3","Leonard: You had some nice moves out there, Howard."
"3","Howard: Thanks. You, too."
"3","Leonard: Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?"
"3","Howard: Not really. I was in my boogie zone."
"3","Bernadette: When Howard tried to do the splits…"
"3","Penny: Shh."
"3","Leonard: Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx."
"3","Penny: Oh, poor baby."
"3","Leonard: Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you."
"3","Penny: Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. (Steps on marbles which are all over the floor, screams and falls)"
"3","Leonard: Oh, my God! Are you… (falls as well)"
"3","Sheldon: Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!"
"3","Penny: Oh, damn."
"3","Leonard: Are you okay?"
"3","Penny: Do I look okay?"
"3","Leonard: Don’t bark at me. I fell, too."
"3","Penny: Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it."
"3","Howard: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
"3","Sheldon: The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet."
"3","Bernadette: With marbles?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?"
"3","Bernadette: Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?"
"3","Sheldon: I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."
"3","Penny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?"
"3","Leonard: No, that’s a crazy thing."
"3","Bernadette: Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?"
"3","Sheldon: They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine."
"3","Bernadette: Which leads to…?"
"3","Sheldon: Impaired cognitive function."
"3","Bernadette: Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed."
"3","Sheldon: But I don’t want to go to bed."
"3","Bernadette: I’m going to count to three. One…"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, all right."
"3","Leonard: That was amazing how you handled him."
"3","Bernadette: I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement."
"3","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom."
"3"," "
"3","Penny: Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep."
"3","Leonard: It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman."
"3","Penny: Well, it creeps me out."
"3","Leonard: Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it."
"3","Penny: Just answer the phone."
"3","Leonard: Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there."
"3","Penny: What happened?"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village."
"3","Penny: Okay. Have fun."
"3","Scene: A children’s play area."
"3","Leonard: Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?"
"3","Security Guard: Ball pit."
"3","Leonard: Thanks for not calling the cops."
"3","Security Guard: Oh, hey, it’s no big deal. My sister’s got a kid who’s special."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?"
"3","Sheldon: Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms."
"3","Leonard: Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?"
"3","Sheldon: Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms."
"3","Leonard: No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now."
"3","Sheldon: But I’m still working."
"3","Leonard: If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out."
"3","Sheldon: You can try, but you’ll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)"
"3","Leonard: For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!"
"3","Sheldon (popping his head up): Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga."
"3","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over their bed. He knocks on the wall."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
"3","Leonard (Waking up as Penny screams): What! What, what, what?"
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
"3","Leonard: What?"
"3","Sheldon: I have good news."
"3","Leonard: And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?"
"3","Sheldon: Your cell phone was off."
"3","Leonard: Because we didn’t want to be disturbed."
"3","Sheldon: And that didn’t work out, did it?"
"3","Penny: Sheldon, what do you want?"
"3","Sheldon: I came to tell you I’ve got the answer."
"3","Leonard: Really? You figured out the graphene problem?"
"3","Sheldon: No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out."
"3","Penny: Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up."
"3","Leonard: What are you talking about?"
"3","Penny (as Sheldon sits on the bed): Oh."
"3","Sheldon: Einstein."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, I’m going to need a little more."
"3","Sheldon: Albert Einstein."
"3","Leonard: Keep going."
"3","Sheldon: When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office."
"3","Leonard: So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?"
"3","Sheldon: Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
"3","Leonard: Sounds like a great plan."
"3","Sheldon: Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow."
"3","Leonard: Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night."
"3","Sheldon: You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back."
"3","Penny: Leonard doesn’t snore."
"3","Sheldon: No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard."
"3","Leonard: Told you."
"3","Scene: An employment office"
"3","Employment Office Assistant: So, Mr. Cooper, you’re looking for a job."
"3","Sheldon: A menial job. Like yours."
"3","Assistant: Why, thank you for noticing. I’m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?"
"3","Sheldon: I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?"
"3","Assistant: No."
"3","Sheldon: Shouldn’t you check your database?"
"3","Assistant (clicks her keyboard a few times): No."
"3","Sheldon: You didn’t really type."
"3","Assistant: I didn’t really have to. So, how about construction?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis."
"3","Assistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead."
"3","Sheldon: I could do that."
"3","Assistant: Good."
"3","Sheldon: One question."
"3","Assistant: Yes?"
"3","Sheldon: What’s sheetrock?"
"3","Assistant: Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?"
"3","Sheldon: That seems acceptable."
"3","Assistant: Do you have your own car?"
"3","Sheldon: I don’t drive."
"3","Assistant: Of course you don’t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?"
"3","Sheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory."
"3","Assistant: I see. Just give me a second. Security!"
"3","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory."
"3","Penny: Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you."
"3","Sheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray): Behind you."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed."
"3","Penny: No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?"
"3","Sheldon: A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am."
"3","Penny: You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
"3","Sheldon: Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
"3","Bernadette: Thanks, Sheldon."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy."
"3","Sheldon: You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen."
"3","Scene: The same, later."
"3","Sheldon: All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit."
"3","Leonard: Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes."
"3","Leonard: Double guacamole?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course."
"3","Leonard: No cilantro?"
"3","Sheldon: Nope."
"3","Leonard: Lettuce shredded, not chopped?"
"3","Sheldon: Yep."
"3","Leonard: You understand why I’m doing this to you?"
"3","Sheldon: I do."
"3","Leonard: That’ll be all. That was fun."
"3","Raj: How long can he keep this up?"
"3","Leonard: I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer."
"3","Raj: He never went back to the university?"
"3","Leonard: Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu."
"3","Raj: Sheesh."
"3","Howard: I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van."
"3","Raj: But he’s afraid of dogs."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan."
"3","Penny: Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon took our order."
"3","Penny: Sheldon doesn’t work here."
"3","Leonard: Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either."
"3","Sheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps): Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry. I don’t work here."
"3","Scene: The roller disco."
"3","Howard: Happy now?"
"3","Raj: I’m on a cloud. Swing me. (Howard swings Raj several times.)"
"3","Scene: The ball pit, presumably earlier."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, come here."
"3","(Sheldon once again keeps popping up his head and shouting “Bazinga” as Leonard flails around trying to catch him.)"
"3","Series 03 Episode 15 – The Large Hadron Collision"
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria."
"3","Howard (on the phone): Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I’ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?"
"3","Raj: Dude, I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?"
"3","Sheldon: Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
"3","Howard: That’s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone."
"3","Raj: Thank you."
"3","Howard: Although, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk."
"3","Leonard: Who’s miserable and alone?"
"3","Raj: Me."
"3","Leonard: Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend."
"3","Sheldon: In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener."
"3","Leonard: Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?"
"3","Howard: Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There’s a $39.95 lover’s special at P.F. Chang’s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front."
"3","Sheldon: Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"
"3","Howard: I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food."
"3","Raj: Well, if anyone’s interested, I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal."
"3","Leonard: Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let’s see, who’s left? Oh, that’s right. My plans. Isn’t anyone going to ask?"
"3","Raj: Fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny."
"3","Leonard: That’s not what I was going to tell you."
"3","Raj: It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me."
"3","Leonard: Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?"
"3","Sheldon: Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize."
"3","Leonard: Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing."
"3","Howard: I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend."
"3","Raj: The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?"
"3","Howard: That’s the one."
"3","Leonard: In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him."
"3","Sheldon: In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?"
"3","Leonard: Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!"
"3","Howard: Oh, man!"
"3","Raj: No way, dude!"
"3","Sheldon: This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing."
"3","Raj: Why wouldn’t you take Penny?"
"3","Leonard: I am taking Penny."
"3","Raj: Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, you got a minute?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland."
"3","Sheldon: Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?"
"3","Leonard: Penny."
"3","Sheldon: What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research."
"3","Leonard: Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps."
"3","Sheldon: But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research."
"3","Leonard: I’m sorry, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six."
"3","Sheldon: Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!"
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Penny: Okay, what’s the big surprise?"
"3","Leonard: Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day."
"3","Penny: Oh. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. We’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?"
"3","Leonard: No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa."
"3","Penny: Okay, I’m starting to think Swiss is key here."
"3","Leonard: Uh-huh."
"3","Penny: We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?"
"3","Leonard: How does that involve air travel?"
"3","Penny: We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?"
"3","Leonard: No."
"3","Penny: Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I’m over it."
"3","Leonard: We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing."
"3","Penny: We’re going skiing in Switzerland?!"
"3","Leonard: Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day."
"3","Penny: Oh, my God, Leonard! That’s incredible!"
"3","Sheldon: Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny."
"3","Penny: My Rabe-what-ly?"
"3","Sheldon: Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny."
"3","Sheldon: Afraid not. Do you recognize this?"
"3","Leonard: Not the roommate agreement."
"3","Sheldon: Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
"3","Leonard: Oh, for God’s sakes."
"3","Penny: You actually put that in an agreement?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie."
"3","Sheldon: He can’t kill me, even if I turn."
"3","Penny: Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?"
"3","Sheldon: No, that seemed a little farfetched."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?"
"3","Sheldon: I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing."
"3","Penny: Okay, I know I shouldn’t ask, but what is…?"
"3","Sheldon (after demonstrating): I’d be much further along if I’d been allowed to practice."
"3","Leonard: Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland."
"3","Sheldon: Is that your final decision?"
"3","Leonard: It is."
"3","Sheldon: Very well."
"3","Penny: It’s not over, is it?"
"3","Leonard: What do you think? (The sound of Tuvan throat singing comes from Sheldon’s bedroom.)"
"3"," "
"3","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"3","Leonard: Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games."
"3","Sheldon: All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
"3","Leonard: You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?"
"3","Sheldon: You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did."
"3","Leonard: Come on, Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"
"3","Sheldon: Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch."
"3","Leonard: Rupert Murdoch?"
"3","Sheldon: He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2."
"3","Howard: I’m sorry I couldn’t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette."
"3","Raj: I know. I saw the Tweet."
"3","Howard: So, what did you end up doing?"
"3","Raj: Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree."
"3","Leonard: You seen Sheldon?"
"3","Raj: No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?"
"3","Howard: I’d take Sheldon to Switzerland."
"3","Leonard: Seriously?"
"3","Howard: Absolutely. And I’d leave him there. (Sheldon enters, puts a tray in front of Leonard, and exits.)"
"3","Raj: What the hell is that?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware."
"3","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom."
"3","Sheldon: Morning, old chum."
"3","Leonard: What’s going on?"
"3","Sheldon: I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo."
"3","Leonard: You made Frodo pancakes?"
"3","Sheldon: Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
"3","Leonard: Why are you doing this?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?"
"3","Leonard: Thanks. It’s good."
"3","Sheldon: What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary."
"3","Leonard: You hate Babylon 5."
"3","Sheldon: I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend."
"3","Leonard: Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland."
"3","Sheldon: Drat. No Frodo for you."
"3","Scene: The laundry room."
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Penny: Hello."
"3","Sheldon: Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here."
"3","Penny: Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room."
"3","Penny: Better acoustics for your throat singing?"
"3","Sheldon (trying it): It’s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD."
"3","Penny: Oh, for God’s sakes."
"3","Sheldon: Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you."
"3","Penny: I’m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?"
"3","Sheldon: Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination."
"3","Penny: Okay, show’s over."
"3","Sheldon: No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go."
"3","Sheldon: Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents."
"3","Penny: I’ll talk to Leonard."
"3","Sheldon: You will?"
"3","Penny: Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go."
"3","Sheldon (Hugging her): Oh, Penny, thank you!"
"3","Penny: You’re welcome."
"3","Sheldon: Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration."
"3","Penny: I think we’re there."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, good. Bye-bye."
"3","Raj: You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day."
"3","Howard: Trust me, you can’t. I’ve tried."
"3","Raj: No, no, no, I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, I need to talk to you."
"3","Sheldon: All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?"
"3","Leonard: Some what?"
"3","Sheldon: Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland."
"3","Leonard: You’re not going to Switzerland!"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?"
"3","Leonard: She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, that good news."
"3","Leonard: Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Penny, not you!"
"3","Sheldon: Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation."
"3","Leonard: I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!"
"3","Sheldon: That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you."
"3","Sheldon: Really?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, really."
"3","Sheldon: Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends."
"3","Leonard: I’m sorry you feel that way."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: Why don’t you enlighten me?"
"3","Sheldon: With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited."
"3","Howard: Ooh, that’s gotta sting."
"3","Scene: Penny’s bedroom."
"3","Leonard: Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day."
"3","Penny: I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion."
"3","Leonard: Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold."
"3","Penny: Think it through, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: Oh!"
"3","Penny: Oh!"
"3","Leonard (Penny sneezes): Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?"
"3","Penny: No, no, it’s probably just allergies."
"3","Leonard: Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental."
"3","Penny: Do any of them work?"
"3","Leonard: Not really, I’m just an enthusiast."
"3","(Time passes. Sound of Penny retching in the bathroom)"
"3","Leonard: Penny? You okay?"
"3","Penny: Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!"
"3","Penny: I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague."
"3","Leonard: Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?"
"3","Penny: Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead."
"3","Scene: Outside Sheldon’s bedroom."
"3","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come. (Sound of Sheldon vomiting in the bathroom)"
"3","Sheldon: Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute. (Vomits again) Oh, look, it’s the cholermus."
"3","Penny: Here’s your soup."
"3","Sheldon: Chicken?"
"3","Penny: Yes."
"3","Sheldon: With the little stars?"
"3","Sheldon: Heated to 180 degrees?"
"3","Penny: Why don’t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me."
"3","Sheldon: You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick."
"3","Penny: Yeah, well, I’m sick, too."
"3","Sheldon: Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle."
"3","Penny: I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon (remembering the hug): It’s you! I touched you!"
"3","Penny: Happy Valentine’s Day."
"3","Scene: A Swiss hotel room."
"3","Raj: Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, I forgot about all this."
"3","Raj: But I never will."

"3","Leonard: Will you please turn your shirt off?"
"3","Raj: What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared."
"3","Howard: Yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples."
"3","Leonard: Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?"
"3","Stuart: Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday."
"3","Sheldon: Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed."
"3","Stuart: No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan’s doing him a favour."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?"
"3","Leonard: Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease."
"3","Sheldon: Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now."
"3","Raj: Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee! (Presses play on his iPod. His shirt starts to play “I’m So Excited” by the Pointer Sisters. He dances.)"
"3","Howard: I’m sad to say I taught him those moves."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3"," "
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Leonard: I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. (Raj presses his iPod. The theme from Jeopardy plays.) Alex, I’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass? (Presses again, his shirt blows a raspberry.)"
"3","Sheldon: I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman."
"3","Howard: That’s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom."
"3","Raj: That’s a great idea, I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well."
"3","Sheldon: What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?"
"3","Howard: Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut."
"3","Raj: Well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision."
"3","Sheldon: There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer."
"3","Howard: Why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?"
"3","Leonard: He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket."
"3","Sheldon: Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine."
"3","Penny: Hi!"
"3","Leonard: Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?"
"3","Penny: Um, can you give me a hint?"
"3","Leonard: Stan Lee."
"3","Penny: Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?"
"3","Leonard: No, no, Stan Lee."
"3","Penny: Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!"
"3","Leonard: You have no idea who he is, do you?"
"3","Penny: Of course I do. You’re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in."
"3","Leonard: Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?"
"3","Penny: Um, he was on Star Trek."
"3","Leonard: Nope."
"3","Penny: Star Wars?"
"3","Leonard: No."
"3","Penny: Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?"
"3","Leonard: That’s Bruce Lee."
"3","Penny: Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee’s nerdy brother, Stan?"
"3","Howard: Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?"
"3","Sheldon: Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet."
"3","Howard: But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don’t you put it in the bank?"
"3","Sheldon: I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge."
"3","Howard: You’ve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court."
"3","Sheldon: Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena."
"3","Penny: I’m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?"
"3","Sheldon: It bothers me."
"3","Howard: Sheldon, this is a summons."
"3","Sheldon: A summons for what?"
"3","Howard: Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture."
"3","Sheldon: November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room."
"3","Penny: No, it isn’t."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, it is."
"3","Sheldon: Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
"3","Penny: Mmm, no, it isn’t."
"3","Sheldon: Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
"3","Penny: Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?"
"3","Sheldon: So you betrayed me?"
"3","Penny: No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands."
"3","Sheldon: But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you."
"3","Penny: Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day."
"3","Leonard: It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine."
"3","Sheldon: I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty."
"3","Howard: You are guilty. (Raj’s shirt plays the gavel sound from Law & Order) That one I liked."
"3","Sheldon: I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, I’m sorry. I’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series."
"3","Sheldon: You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now."
"3","Howard: Okay, he’s going to jail."
"3","Leonard (after Raj whispers to him): Oh, that’s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day."
"3","Sheldon: Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee."
"3","Leonard: Whoa! What do you mean all?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, okay. No."
"3","Sheldon: Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?"
"3","Leonard: That’s what I’m saying."
"3","Sheldon: Howard?"
"3","Howard: Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie’s Choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. No."
"3","Sheldon: Raj? You’ll be there, won’t you? (Shirt plays “incorrect” quiz sound) All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness."
"3","Penny: Oh, balls."
"3","Sheldon: Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks."
"3","Scene: Penny’s door."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"3","Penny (opening door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"3","Sheldon: That’s just wrong."
"3","Penny: All right, let’s go."
"3","Sheldon: Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I’d like to call on your skills as an actress."
"3","Penny: What is this?"
"3","Sheldon: I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?"
"3","Penny: Do I have a choice?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?"
"3","Penny (reading): Darn tootin’, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase."
"3","Sheldon: Excellent. Go on."
"3","Penny: The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I’ve ever seen in, like, ever."
"3","Sheldon: And who performed that heroic act?"
"3","Penny: Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you."
"3","Sheldon: There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts."
"3","Penny: But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?"
"3","Sheldon: Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well."
"3","Penny (pretending to be close to tears): But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally."
"3","Sheldon: Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again."
"3","Scene: The courtroom."
"3","Judge: Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?"
"3","Sheldon: Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself."
"3","Judge: I know what it means. I went to law school."
"3","Sheldon: And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement."
"3","Judge: The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium."
"3","Sheldon: Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete."
"3","Judge: Impressive."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you."
"3","Judge: Guilty. Pay the cashier."
"3","Sheldon: I object. You’re completely ignoring the law."
"3","Judge: No, I’m following the law. I’m ignoring you."
"3","Sheldon: Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours."
"3","Judge: Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I’m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark."
"3","Sheldon: I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth."
"3","Scene: A police cell. Three people sit on a bench inside. Sheldon points at the one on the end."
"3","Sheldon: That’s my spot."
"3","Scene: A queue outside the comic book store."
"3","Raj: I can’t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter."
"3","Leonard: Oh, come on, why would you do that?"
"3","Raj: Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr."
"3","Howard: Okay, I’m cutting. I’m not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off."
"3","Leonard (phone rings.): Hey."
"3","Penny: Sheldon’s in jail."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon’s in jail?"
"3","Raj: You called it."
"3","Leonard: For what?"
"3","Penny: What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes."
"3","Leonard: So tell him to apologize."
"3","Penny: Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail."
"3","Leonard: Oh, no, that’s terrible. Ooh, the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye."
"3","Scene: The police cell."
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?"
"3","Guard: What?"
"3","Sheldon: I need to use the restroom."
"3","Guard: Knock yourself out. (Points to urinal in cell)"
"3","Sheldon: That’s the toilet?"
"3","Guard: Well, it ain’t a wishing well."
"3","Sheldon: Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize."
"3","Leonard: Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
"3","Howard: Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
"3","Raj: Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee."
"3","Howard: That’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names."
"3","Raj: Hey, I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model."
"3","Penny: We’re home."
"3","Leonard: Oh, hey, buddy. How’d it go?"
"3","Sheldon: You know very well how it went."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
"3","Sheldon: I was found guilty and fined $533."
"3","Penny: I’m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others."
"3","Sheldon: I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
"3","Howard: Plus, you didn’t get to meet Stan Lee."
"3","Leonard: Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit."
"3","Howard: You’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato."
"3","Sheldon: You had gelato with Stan Lee?"
"3","Howard: He said we could call him Stan."
"3","Leonard: Except for Raj."
"3","Sheldon: Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today."
"3","Penny: Okay, I realize that…"
"3","Sheldon: Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee."
"3","Penny: Okay, maybe you’ll have another chance to have…"
"3","Sheldon: No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
"3","Penny: Did he just somehow give me the finger?"
"3","Howard: Not just the finger. The moving finger."
"3","Scene: The comic book store."
"3","Penny: Hey, Stuart."
"3","Stuart: Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi."
"3","Penny: What’s going on?"
"3","Stuart: Nothing. I’m just getting ready to close up and head out."
"3","Penny: Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?"
"3","Stuart: Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat."
"3","Penny: Oh, nice."
"3","Stuart: Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn’t even show up."
"3","Penny: Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour."
"3","Stuart: Sure, yeah, name it."
"3","Penny: Well, I’m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet."
"3","Stuart: Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t have his phone number."
"3","Penny: Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you."
"3","Stuart: Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address."
"3","Penny: Really? Great!"
"3","Stuart: But I can’t give it to you."
"3","Penny: Then why did you tell me you had it?"
"3","Stuart: I don’t know. Just chatting. You’re looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight."
"3","Penny: I’m sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway."
"3","Stuart: Mm-hmm. Wait."
"3","Penny: Yeah?"
"3","Stuart: Maybe we can make a deal."
"3","Penny: What kind of deal?"
"3","Stuart: I will give you the address if you go to my cousin’s wedding with me."
"3","Penny: You’re extorting a date out of me?"
"3","Stuart: I kind of have to. The cousin who’s getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with."
"3","Penny: Can I bring Leonard?"
"3","Stuart: Sure. What the hell."
"3","Penny: Deal."
"3","Stuart: We’ll tell people he’s your cousin."
"3","Scene: Outside Stan Lee’s house."
"3","Sheldon: This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb, then we were on Stan Lee’s walk, and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door."
"3","Penny: Yup."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee."
"3","Penny: Okay, sweetie, I don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies, or he’s just gonna say hi, or really what’s gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we’ll…"
"3","Stan Lee (opening door): Yeah?"
"3","Penny: Are you Stan Lee?"
"3","Stan Lee: Oh, damn."
"3","Penny: Hi. I’m Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: We’re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes."
"3","Penny: Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail."
"3","Stan Lee: I see. And you thought you’d just come over to my house uninvited?"
"3","Sheldon: You said we were invited."
"3","Penny: Oh, no, no, I said I’m inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee’s house."
"3","Stan Lee: You know, you fan boys are unbelievable. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don’t you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, I’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you."
"3","Penny: I’m sorry. He doesn’t really understand sarcasm."
"3","Stan Lee: Well, I’ll give him something he’ll understand. Joanie, call the police!"
"3","Penny: Nice to meet you."
"3","Raj: Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors…"
"3","Howard: Would you just let it go?"
"3","Raj: And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom."
"3","Leonard (as Sheldon enters): Hey, where’ve you been?"
"3","Sheldon: I’ll tell you where I’ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
"3","Howard: Sweet."
"3","Sheldon: Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy."
"3","Series 03 Episode 17 – The Precious Fragmentation"
"3","Scene: The stairwell. Leonard is carrying a large box."
"3","Leonard: Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle."
"3","Leonard: One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle."
"3","Penny (who is inside the apartment): Oh, it’s about time, I’m starving."
"3","Leonard: Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food."
"3","Penny: Why not?"
"3","Leonard: Don’t panic, this is better."
"3","Penny: Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city."
"3","Penny: Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down."
"3","Leonard: We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him."
"3","Penny: Who’s Adam West?"
"3","Sheldon: Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
"3","Howard: My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one."
"3","Leonard: Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
"3","Howard: They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks."
"3","Leonard: We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here."
"3","Penny: There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one."
"3","Leonard: No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! (Raj whispers to Leonard) Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind."
"3","Howard: Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?"
"3","Penny: That is so sad."
"3","Sheldon: No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman."
"3","Credits sequence"
"3"," "
"3","Scene: The same"
"3","Leonard: Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical."
"3","Penny: Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony."
"3","Leonard: Okay, bye."
"3","Penny: Okay."
"3","Leonard: Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots."
"3","Raj: And an Aquaman action figure."
"3","Howard: Looks like someone drew a penis on him."
"3","Raj: Huh? That’ll come off."
"3","Howard: You see what you’re doing? Stop that."
"3","Sheldon: Fascinating."
"3","Leonard: What?"
"3","Sheldon: It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring."
"3","Leonard: Oh."
"3","Raj: It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it."
"3","Sheldon: It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to"
"3","rule them all."
"3","Raj: One Ring to find them."
"3","Howard: One Ring to bring them all."
"3","Leonard: And in the darkness bind them."
"3","Raj: Holy crap, are we nerdy."
"3","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory"
"3","Howard: So, I was doing some checking on the ring."
"3","Raj: Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape."
"3","Raj: No, that’s okay. I’ll get it."
"3","Howard: Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world."
"3","Leonard: Seedy underbelly?"
"3","Howard: You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff."
"3","Raj: Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?"
"3","Howard: Just a guy. I know a guy."
"3","Raj: Is it Eddie Crispo?"
"3","Howard: No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking."
"3","Raj: Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo."
"3","Howard: I know lots of dangerous people, okay?"
"3","Raj: Name one."
"3","Howard: Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. It’s the real deal."
"3","Sheldon: If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
"3","Leonard: He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?"
"3","Howard: No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring."
"3","Sheldon (snatching it): Mine!"
"3","Leonard: No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together."
"3","Sheldon: Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure."
"3","Leonard: How is this maritime salvage?"
"3","Sheldon: Other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
"3","Raj: Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?"
"3","Howard: Well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…"
"3","Raj: Your guy Eddie Crispo?"
"3","Howard: Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand."
"3","Raj: Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski."
"3","Howard: Why do you want a jet ski?"
"3","Raj: All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence."
"3","Sheldon: We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
"3","Howard: It’s sad how great that sounds."
"3","Leonard: Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him."
"3","Howard: Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie."
"3","Raj: There are no Jewish hobbits."
"3","Howard: Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah."
"3","Leonard: We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?"
"3","Sheldon: You mean my ring?"
"3","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"3","Sheldon: The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did."
"3","Leonard: Give me that."
"3","Raj: Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski."
"3","Sheldon: I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way."
"3","Leonard: You always get your way."
"3","Sheldon: I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring."
"3","Penny: Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it."
"3","Penny: What ring?"
"3","Leonard: This ring."
"3","Sheldon: Looking for something?"
"3","Leonard: Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?"
"3","Penny: Why?"
"3","Leonard: It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it."
"3","Penny: Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don’t even get to keep it?"
"3","Howard: If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great Aunt Ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat."
"3","Leonard: How am I looking now?"
"3","Scene: Penny and Leonard are asleep in Leonard’s bed. Sheldon creeps in and tries to take the ring from round Penny’s neck, but she turns over. He tries to make buzzing fly noises to get her to turn back, but she turns all the way the other way. He then uses an extender with a claw on the end to lif the ring from Penny’s chest. As he tries to remove it, she wakes up, screams, and punches him in the face."
"3","Sheldon: Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!"
"3","Leonard: What was that?"
"3","Penny: Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him."
"3","Leonard: That’s my girl."
"3","Scene: The cafeteria."
"3","Howard: So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter."
"3","Raj: Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?"
"3","Leonard: No."
"3","Raj: I was afraid of that. (Opens his laptop to reveal an Indian looking man on a webcam.) Go ahead."
"3","Man on Screen: Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj’s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali."
"3","Raj: Also my cousin."
"3","Howard: You brought a lawyer?"
"3","Venkatesh: Don’t answer that. I’ll get straight to the point. My client’s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis."
"3","Leonard: We’re not giving him two Jet Skis."
"3","Venkatesh: Look, we’re big boys, why don’t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done."
"3","Leonard: No Jet Skis."
"3","Venkatesh: All right, forget the Jet Skis."
"3","Raj: Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”"
"3","Venkatesh: What can I say? They played hardball. We lost."
"3","Raj: You’re useless."
"3","Venkatesh: I told you that when you hired me."
"3","Raj: I’m signing off now."
"3","Venkatesh: Call your mother, she worries."
"3","Howard: Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe."
"3","Leonard: You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?"
"3","Sheldon: You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room."
"3","Sheldon: No, it’s mine."
"3","Raj: It’s all of ours. (They begin to struggle over the ring.)"
"3","Leonard: Okay, now, this is ridiculous!"
"3","Howard: Then let go!"
"3","Leonard: I’m not letting go, you let go."
"3","Howard: I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on."
"3","Leonard: Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?"
"3","Raj: Sure. Let go of the ring."
"3","Leonard: All right, it starts now."
"3","Howard: You do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. (They start to move away from the table while all still holding the ring.)"
"3","Raj: Wait, my laptop. (They go back for it.)"
"3","Scene: The stairwell. The guys are coming up the stairs, all still holding the ring."
"3","Howard: You know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic."
"3","Leonard: And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?"
"3","Sheldon: I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service."
"3","Leonard: You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City."
"3","Raj: There are six seasons, dude."
"3","Leonard: Oh, crap!"
"3","Raj: No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride."
"3","Leonard: Door. (Leonard tries to unlock the door and drops the keys.)"
"3","Raj: Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae."
"3","Penny: Whatcha doin’?"
"3","Leonard: Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly."
"3","Penny: No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me."
"3","Leonard: Thank you."
"3","Penny: FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret."
"3","Leonard: I’m out."
"3","Scene: The apartment. The three guys are still holding the ring. Howard is on the phone."
"3","Howard: I’m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office."
"3","Raj: No, he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!"
"3","Howard: Will you be quiet?"
"3","Raj: Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!"
"3","Howard: I’ll call you back."
"3","Raj: I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies."
"3","Howard: Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!"
"3","Raj: If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies."
"3","Sheldon: Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?"
"3","Raj: Why don’t we go after your mother?"
"3","Sheldon: Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?"
"3","Howard: That’s not gonna Better pull out the big gun."
"3","Raj: You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother."
"3","Sheldon: No! I call no Meemaws."
"3","Raj: Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t want to hear this."
"3","Howard: Then let go of the ring and walk away."
"3","Sheldon: Never."
"3","Howard: All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it."
"3","Sheldon: Stop it!"
"3","Raj: Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty."
"3","Sheldon: I said stop it!"
"3","Howard: We’re getting to him."
"3","Sheldon: Waterfalls!"
"3","Raj: What?"
"3","Sheldon: Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks."
"3","Howard: What are you doing?"
"3","Sheldon: Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing."
"3","Raj: It’s, it’s not working, dude."
"3","Sheldon: Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee."
"3","Raj: Then let go of the ring and go."
"3","Howard: No, actually, I wouldn’t mind going, too."
"3","Raj: Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…"
"3","Sheldon: Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
"3","Howard: We stand up."
"3","Sheldon: Excellent choice."
"3","Raj: Three."
"3","Howard: Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes."
"3","Scene: Sometime later. The guys are on the settee. Howard is seen asleep, he is not holding the ring. The camera pans along to where Sheldon and Raj still hold the ring. Raj, also asleep, lets go and cuddles up to Howard."
"3","Sheldon: I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine! (He runs to the bathroom) We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. (He looks in the mirror and has turned into golem. He screams and wakes up, still on the settee.) Where’s the ring?"
"3","Leonard: It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from."
"3","Raj: The fires of Mount Doom?"
"3","Leonard: Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours."
"3","Howard: You quit the game! You had no right to take it."
"3","Leonard: I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it."
"3","Raj: Well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner."
"3","Leonard: There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! (Goes to his bedroom. Takes a box from under his bed. Takes out the ring.) My precious."
"3","Scene: Leonard and Penny are asleep in Leonard’s bed. The extender and claw reaches across and pulls down the sheet revealing the ring on a chain round Leonard’s neck."
"3","Sheldon: I knew it. Give us the precious!"
"3","Leonard: NEVER!"
"3","(They begin to struggle, both shouting “give it”, “give it to me” and “it’s mine” at various intervals. Penny gets out of the bed and heads out the door.)"
"3","Penny: Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym."
"3","Series 03 Episode 18 – The Pants Alternative"
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria."
"3","Raj: Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk."
"3","Howard: Yeah, so?"
"3","Raj: So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails."
"3","Howard: What’s your point?"
"3","Raj: My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I’d be very nervous around James Cameron."
"3","Sheldon: It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?"
"3","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science."
"3","Sheldon: And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
"3","Leonard: Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You."
"3","Sheldon: I won?"
"3","Leonard: You won."
"3","Sheldon: I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."
"3","Raj: Well, good for him."
"3","Howard: Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
"3","Credits sequence"
"3"," "
"3","Scene: The apartment. The guys are watching Avatar in 3D. All are wearing 3D glasses except Raj."
"3","Howard: Didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?"
"3","Raj: No."
"3","Leonard: Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses."
"3","Sheldon (phone rings): Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please."
"3","Howard: Uh, hang on, flaming arrow."
"3","Sheldon: Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call (aside) three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don’t want to forfeit the award? Well, you’ve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. (Hangs up) Problem."
"3","Leonard: What?"
"3","Sheldon: They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech."
"3","Howard: Well, no, you’re mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can’t do is shut up."
"3","Raj: Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking."
"3","Sheldon: I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds."
"3","Leonard: What, to you, is a large crowd?"
"3","Sheldon: Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it."
"3","Sheldon: I’m not accepting the award."
"3","Penny: Why not?"
"3","Howard: Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright."
"3","Penny: That’s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen’s court."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous."
"3","Sheldon: Am I? Let me tell you a story."
"3","Howard: Where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?"
"3","Sheldon: I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours."
"3","Penny: I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks."
"3","Sheldon: I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear. (He faints.)"
"3","Penny: Oh, my God."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
"3","Sheldon: Don’t trample me."
"3","Scene: The stairwell. Sheldon is on the phone."
"3","Sheldon: Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes, I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. (Enters apartment. The others are sitting as if waiting for him.) Hello."
"3","Leonard: Sit down, we want to talk to you."
"3","Sheldon: Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?"
"3","Penny: Just sit."
"3","Leonard: We think we can help you with your stage fright."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you."
"3","Penny: Yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant."
"3","Penny: Okay, your problem is, you’re trying to do this all by yourself."
"3","Leonard: We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men."
"3","Sheldon: I do like the X-Men."
"3","Penny: Did I see X-Men?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it."
"3","Penny: Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?"
"3","Sheldon: I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?"
"3","Penny: Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence."
"3","Sheldon: That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety."
"3","Sheldon: What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?"
"3","Leonard: My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
"3","Howard: Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don’t know, some Indian meditation crap."
"3","Sheldon: I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me."
"3","Howard: My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that’s 24-7, buddy."
"3","Sheldon: And I appreciate the pretence."
"3","Penny: So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?"
"3","Sheldon: No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men."
"3","Howard: Oh, that’s not a good name."
"3","Scene: The apartment. Raj is lighting candles. Indian music is playing."
"3","Raj: Okay, Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears."
"3","Sheldon: And yet, you can’t speak to women."
"3","Raj: True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes."
"3","Sheldon: Okay, but don’t punch me."
"3","Raj: What?"
"3","Sheldon: When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me."
"3","Raj: I’m not going to punch you."
"3","Sheldon: That’s what my sister used to say."
"3","Raj: Do you want to do this or not?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry. Proceed."
"3","Raj: All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?"
"3","Sheldon: Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis."
"3","Raj: Okay, you’re in Sheldonopolis."
"3","Sheldon: Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?"
"3","Raj: Whatever you like."
"3","Sheldon: I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation."
"3","Raj: Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square."
"3","Sheldon: Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy."
"3","Raj: Then, put on a sweater."
"3","Sheldon: Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart."
"3","Raj: Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater."
"3","Sheldon: You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount."
"3","Raj: You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!"
"3","Sheldon: Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
"3","Raj: All right. You’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in Sheldon Square."
"3","Sheldon: Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no."
"3","Raj: What now?"
"3","Sheldon: A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! (Sound of door slamming) Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum."
"3","Scene: A clothing store."
"3","Sheldon: I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?"
"3","Penny: It’ll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I’m feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life."
"3","Sheldon: Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?"
"3","Penny: Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice."
"3","Sheldon: It’s only one colour."
"3","Penny: Yeah, so?"
"3","Sheldon: That’s a lot of money for only one colour."
"3","Penny: Fine. Why don’t you pick out what you like."
"3","Sheldon: Hmm. (Cut to Sheldon exiting changing room in a loud check suit). This is pretty sharp."
"3","Penny: No, you’re wrong."
"3","Sheldon (now in a sparkly green suit with rhinestones): This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. (Cut to Sheldon exiting in a white dinner suit with tails) Okay, I think we have a winner."
"3","Penny: Where the hell d’you find that?"
"3","Sheldon: In the prom department."
"3","Penny: It’s ridiculous."
"3","Sheldon: Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court."
"3","Penny: Please just try this one on."
"3","Sheldon: Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. (Goes into changing room. Comes out in black suit looking terrific.) This is absurd. I look like a clown."
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Leonard: So, Sheldon, how you doing?"
"3","Sheldon: That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s."
"3","Leonard: I’m sorry, I’ll start again."
"3","Sheldon: Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?"
"3","Leonard: Um, I don’t know, maybe."
"3","Sheldon: I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
"3","Leonard: How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?"
"3","Sheldon: I was wearing size a million pants."
"3","Leonard: Why don’t we just talk?"
"3","Sheldon: Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."
"3","Leonard: Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?"
"3","Sheldon: Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
"3","Leonard: But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back."
"3","Sheldon: And how did that make you feel?"
"3","Leonard: Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout."
"3","Sheldon: Go on."
"3","Leonard: It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone."
"3","Sheldon: So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother."
"3","Leonard: Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: For what?"
"3","Sheldon: If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony."
"3","Leonard: Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!"
"3","Scene: The award ceremony."
"3","Leonard: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of… (continues as background noise)"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, dear."
"3","Penny: What’s the matter?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m getting dizzy."
"3","Raj: Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men."
"3","Sheldon: I can’t do this. I’m going to faint."
"3","Penny: Here, drink this. It’ll relax you."
"3","Sheldon: Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol."
"3","Penny: Fine, faint."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective."
"3","Penny: Here, see if this one works."
"3","Leonard (still talking): First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. If you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me."
"3","Sheldon: I’m ready."
"3","Leonard: Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
"3","Sheldon: Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. (Singing) There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,"
"3","neptunium, germanium… Everybody! And iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium… Just the Asians! And lanthanum and osmium, and astatine and radium…"
"3","Sheldon: Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?"
"3","Penny: Sure."
"3","Sheldon: Question one, where are my pants?"
"3","Leonard: You might want to check YouTube."
"3","Sheldon: What do I search?"
"3","Leonard: It’s already loaded. Just hit play."
"3","On-screen Sheldon: All right, people, let’s get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body’s in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating."
"3","Leonard: Uh-uh, give it a minute."
"3","On-screen Sheldon: Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here’s Uranus."

"3","Scene: Leonard and Penny are in Penny’s bed."
"3","Penny: Having a little trouble catching your breath there?"
"3","Leonard: No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder."
"3","Penny: Do or do not. There is no try."
"3","Leonard: Did you just quote Star Wars?"
"3","Penny: I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back."
"3","Leonard: Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny."
"3","Penny: Oh. Oh. Thank you."

"3","Penny: Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad."
"3","Leonard: Good. Glad is good."
"3","Penny: Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep."

"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Howard: Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?"
"3","Raj: Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile."
"3","Sheldon: You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant."
"3","Leonard: Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?"
"3","Howard: What’s with him?"
"3","Sheldon: Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle."
"3","Howard: Are you saying he’s man-struating?"
"3","Sheldon: Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels."
"3","Raj: Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about."
"3","Scene: The comic book store."
"3","Howard: Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?"
"3","Raj: Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do."
"3","Sheldon: Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis."
"3","Raj: Maybe that’s what they want to talk about."
"3","Howard: Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?"
"3","Leonard: I honestly don’t care."
"3","Raj: Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions."
"3","Leonard: What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass."
"3","Howard: Would that be a giant rat’s ass?"
"3","Sheldon: For the record, giant rats are possible."
"3","Leonard: Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?"
"3","Howard: Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible."
"3","Sheldon: Of course they are. Leonard’s being one."
"3","Raj: Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny."
"3","Leonard: No, there was no spat."
"3","Howard: Oh, but something happened."
"3","Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it."
"3","Sheldon: But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me."
"3","Howard: What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?"
"3","Raj: Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?"
"3","Leonard: What? No."
"3","Raj: I’m just asking, dude. It happens."
"3","Stuart: You guys still on for bowling tonight?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her."
"3","Stuart: Oh. Ouch."
"3","Sheldon: That is what is referred to as a burn on you."
"3","Howard: Did you ask her to start waxing?"
"3","Leonard: No."
"3","Raj: Did you start waxing?"
"3","Howard: While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?"
"3","Leonard: I’m walking away from you now."
"3","Howard: That wasn’t a no."
"3","Raj: Yeah, I think we’re getting close."
"3","Scene: The stairwell."
"3","Howard: Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way."
"3","Raj: Oh, that would be a good way to go."
"3","Penny: Hi."
"3","Leonard: Oh, hey."
"3","Sheldon: Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock."
"3","Penny: Oh, right, bowling."
"3","Leonard: You don’t have to come if you don’t want to."
"3","Penny: No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me."
"3","Sheldon: We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage."
"3","Penny: It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Sarcasm?"
"3","Penny: Thinly veiled contempt."
"3","Sheldon: Remember, seven o’clock."
"3","Penny: Got it."
"3","Sheldon: Pacific Daylight time!"
"3","Penny: Bite me!"
"3","Sheldon: Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes."
"3","Scene: The bowling alley."
"3","Howard: I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes."
"3","Sheldon: These are my own bowling shoes."
"3","Howard: Then what’s with the disinfectant?"
"3","Sheldon: I know where my feet have been."
"3","Stuart: Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn’t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton."
"3","Wil: Hi, Sheldon. How’s it going?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox."
"3","Wil: You’re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?"
"3","Sheldon: I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?"
"3","Wil: It tells me that I am living rent-free right here (pointing at Sheldon’s head). You ready to bowl?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good."
"3","Wil: Great. Then it’s on."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off."
"3","Time lapse."
"3","Wil: Yes!"
"3","Sheldon: A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird."
"3","Howard: Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan."
"3","Wil: Oh, thanks."
"3","Howard: I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?"
"3","Raj: Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah."
"3","Leonard: Chilli cheese fry?"
"3","Penny: Yes. I love chilli cheese fries."
"3","Leonard: Really? You love them?"
"3","Penny: Yeah, why?"
"3","Leonard: No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something."
"3","Penny: Do you really want to get into this right now?"
"3","Leonard: Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know."
"3","Penny: Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say."
"3","Leonard: Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?"
"3","Penny: I’m not sure."
"3","Leonard: How can you not be sure?"
"3","Penny: Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation."
"3","Leonard: No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night."
"3","Penny: Don’t push it, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: I am not pushing anything."
"3","Penny: You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!"
"3","Raj: Ah, the premature I love you."
"3","Howard: I guessed premature. Does that count?"
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment door."
"3"," "
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"3","Penny: What?"
"3","Sheldon: This is for you."
"3","Penny: Ice cream?"
"3","Sheldon: I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream."
"3","Penny: Um, Ach."
"3","Sheldon: If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna."
"3","Penny: Did Leonard send you over here?"
"3","Sheldon: No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton."
"3","Penny: Yeah, I’m sorry about that."
"3","Sheldon: I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep."
"3","Penny: Again, I’m sorry."
"3","Sheldon: And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette."
"3","Penny: You’re kidding."
"3","Sheldon: No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream."
"3","Penny: All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?"
"3","Sheldon: The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight."
"3","Penny: Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now."
"3","Sheldon: You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that."
"3","Penny: No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll get back to you."
"3","Sheldon: When are you going to talk to him?"
"3","Penny: I don’t know."
"3","Sheldon: He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time."
"3","Penny: You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question."
"3","Scene: The laundry room."
"3","Penny: I think we should talk now."
"3","Leonard: What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good."
"3","Penny: Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?"
"3","Leonard: All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
"3","Penny: Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well."
"3","Leonard: Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like."
"3","Penny: I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, I do."
"3","Penny: So, we’re good?"
"3","Leonard: Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great."
"3","Sheldon: All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here."
"3","Sheldon: Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch."
"3","Penny: The Wesley Crushers?"
"3","Sheldon: No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”"
"3","Penny: I don’t get it."
"3","Leonard: Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek."
"3","Penny: Still don’t get it."
"3","Sheldon: It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley."
"3","Penny: Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher."
"3","Sheldon: What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”"
"3","Howard: You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers."
"3","Sheldon: Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”"
"3","Wil: Hey, look. They named their team after me."
"3","Sheldon: No, it’s not the… Never mind."
"3","Stuart: So, we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis."
"3","Stuart: Ouch again."
"3","Wil: Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I’m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?"
"3","Wil: After you."
"3","Sheldon: No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley."
"3","Wil: It’s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first."
"3","Sheldon: All right."
"3","Wil: It’s a custom, not a rule."
"3","Sheldon: I so loathe you."
"3","Wil: That’s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side."
"3","Sheldon: That’s not even from your franchise!"
"3","Stuart: I, um, I want you to know that even though we’re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will."
"3","Penny: Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know."
"3","Stuart: Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what’s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I’m gonna bowl now."
"3","Sheldon: Be the ball, Howard."
"3","Howard: Leave me alone, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: You weren’t the ball."
"3","Penny: Hey, thanks."
"3","Leonard: This is fun, huh?"
"3","Penny: Yeah."
"3","Leonard: It’s good that we got out and did something physical."
"3","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"3","Leonard: Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins."
"3","Penny: Yeah, that’s right."
"3","Leonard: Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up."
"3","All (chanting): Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!"
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball."
"3","All (chanting): The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!"
"3","Sheldon: Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say."
"3","Wil: I’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend."
"3","Penny: Oh, yeah, me, too."
"3","Wil: It’s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you’re not ready for it."
"3","Penny: Tell me about it."
"3","Wil: I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn’t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal."
"3","Penny: Oh, I’m sorry."
"3","Wil: Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery."
"3","Penny: Really?"
"3","Wil: Yeah, would have been kinder."
"3","Stuart: Wil, you’re up."
"3","Wil: Oh, that’s me."
"3","Sheldon: Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?"
"3","Penny: What are you talking about?"
"3","Sheldon: He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?"
"3","Penny: No!"
"3","Sheldon: Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card."
"3","Sheldon: Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."
"3","Leonard: Penny, you’re up."
"3","Sheldon: All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball."
"3","Penny: Yeah, I got it."
"3","Leonard: We really need a strike here."
"3","Penny: I know."
"3","Leonard: So just take your time and concentrate."
"3","Penny: Leonard, stop pressuring me."
"3","Leonard: I’m not pressuring you."
"3","Penny: Yeah, you are! Just back off!"
"3","Leonard: Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up."
"3","Penny: I didn’t mean shut up."
"3","Leonard: Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it."
"3","Penny: No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry."
"3","Sheldon: Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!"
"3","Leonard: No, let her go."
"3","Sheldon: Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!"
"3","Leonard: I’m pretty sure it’s already over."
"3","Wil: Tough luck, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: You did this, didn’t you?"
"3","Wil: Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?"
"3","Sheldon: No, I suppose not."
"3","Wil: Good. Keep thinking that."
"3","Sheldon: Wheaton!"
"3","Stuart: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I’m telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it’s time to collect."

"3","Scene: The lobby."
"3","Penny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!"
"3","Sheldon: Uh-oh."
"3","Penny: What?"
"3","Sheldon: I was going to get my mail."
"3","Penny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?"
"3","Sheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus."
"3","Penny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus."
"3","Penny: Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus."
"3","Sheldon: Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends."
"3","Penny: Really?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain."
"3","Penny: Right."
"3","Sheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?"
"3","Penny: Everyone."
"3","Sheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse."
"3","Penny: Great."
"3","Sheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve."
"3","Penny: So, how you been?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period."
"3","Penny: You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?"
"3","Sheldon: Bazinga."
"3","Penny: Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?"
"3","Sheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that."
"3","Penny: I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it."
"3","Sheldon: I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce."
"3","Penny: Yep."
"3","Sheldon: That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat."
"3","Penny: Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night."
"3","Sheldon: I’m hungry now."
"3","Penny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?"
"3","Sheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?"
"3","Penny: I don’t have hot dogs."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment)."
"3","Leonard: Hey, where you been?"
"3","Sheldon: I was talking with Penny."
"3","Howard: What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool."
"3","Leonard: No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it."
"3","Raj: Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black."
"3","Sheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil."
"3","Howard: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny."
"3","Sheldon: Which one picks last?"
"3","Howard: What?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry."
"3","Sheldon: Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!"
"3","Leonard: Okay."
"3","Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t know. Why?"
"3","Sheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!"
"3","Credits sequence"
"3"," "
"3","Scene: A few moments later."
"3","Howard: Oh, God, this is good."
"3","Raj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?"
"3","Howard: Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux."
"3","Leonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?"
"3","Sheldon: Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!"
"3","Leonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?"
"3","Howard: Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World."
"3","Leonard: What about you, Raj?"
"3","Raj: Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again."
"3","Leonard: I never stopped hanging out with you."
"3","Raj: Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman."
"3","Howard: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank."
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
"3","Leonard: You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone."
"3","Raj: What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?"
"3","Sheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk."
"3","Leonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?"
"3","Howard: Yeah, since when do you take walks?"
"3","Sheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye."
"3","Howard: Hold on. I’ll walk down with you."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first."
"3","Howard: Or we could go together."
"3","Sheldon: I can’t think of a reason why not."
"3","Howard: Let’s go."
"3","Sheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason."
"3","Raj: I’ve missed you."
"3","Sheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me."
"3","Howard: Okay."
"3","Sheldon: What?"
"3","Howard: You said you were going for a walk."
"3","Sheldon: I didn’t say outside."
"3","Howard: So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"
"3","Sheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior."
"3","Woman’s voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy."
"3","Howard: Which way are you going?"
"3","Sheldon: Which way are you going?"
"3","Howard: I parked my scooter down the block."
"3","Sheldon: I’m going the other way. Bye."
"3","Howard: Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?"
"3","Sheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell."
"3","Howard: I definitely smell raw hot dog."
"3","Sheldon: Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour."
"3","Howard: All right, have a nice walk."
"3","Sheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot."
"3","Howard: You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13 horses here."
"3","Sheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!"
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life."
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Raj: Hey, Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah?"
"3","Raj: I haven’t had sex in a year."
"3","Leonard: Where you going with this, Raj?"
"3","Raj: Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman."
"3","Leonard: So, go."
"3","Raj: Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser."
"3","Leonard: And you think my presence will help with that?"
"3","Raj: Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch."
"3","Leonard: I’m not going out tonight, Raj."
"3","Raj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?"
"3","Leonard: Very much."
"3","Raj: Doesn’t have to be Asian."
"3","Leonard: Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday."
"3","Raj: No, I won’t."
"3","Leonard: Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman."
"3","Raj: You really think so?"
"3","Leonard: I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces."
"3","Raj: But we’ll have sex first, right?"
"3","Sheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian."
"3","Penny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."
"3","Penny: Well, good."
"3","Sheldon: I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you."
"3","Penny: He’s been crying?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention."
"3","Penny: Oh, God, I feel terrible."
"3","Sheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?"
"3","Penny: No. Why, do you?"
"3","Sheldon: No."
"3","Penny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?"
"3","Sheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn."
"3","Penny: All right. So, what’s new in your life?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running."
"3","Penny: Have you been running?"
"3","Sheldon: No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm."
"3","Penny: I’m so glad you like it."
"3","Sheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me."
"3","Penny: Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook."
"3","Sheldon: You can’t cook and you made me this."
"3","Penny: Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell."
"3","Raj: Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?"
"3","Leonard: I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys."
"3","Raj: You don’t know that. Prison changes people."
"3","Sheldon: I told you, walking."
"3","Leonard: For an hour and a half?"
"3","Sheldon: I got lost."
"3","Leonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS."
"3","Sheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares."
"3","Raj: There are no solar flares right now."
"3","Sheldon: Yes, there are."
"3","Raj: Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it."
"3","Sheldon: I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died."

"3","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard."
"3","Leonard: Oh, just come in!"
"3","Sheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice."
"3","Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?"
"3","Sheldon: Maybe this isn’t a good time."
"3","Leonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you."
"3","Sheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me."
"3","Leonard: What do you want?"
"3","Sheldon: You may want to sit down."
"3","Leonard: I’m in bed!"
"3","Sheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon!"
"3","Sheldon: I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back."
"3","Leonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?"
"3","Sheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?"
"3","Leonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?"
"3","Sheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs."
"3","Leonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?"
"3","Sheldon: I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money."
"3","Leonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos."
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny."
"3","Sheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?"
"3","Leonard: Yes."
"3","Sheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."
"3","Leonard: I guess not."
"3","Sheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs."
"3","Scene: The laundry room."
"3","Penny: Oh, um, I, I can come back."
"3","Leonard: D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it."
"3","Penny: Yeah, I guess you’re right."
"3","Leonard: You used to it yet?"
"3","Penny: Nope."
"3","Leonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine."
"3","Penny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me."
"3","Leonard: His mother?"
"3","Penny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels."
"3","Leonard: I was going to do that."
"3","Penny: Oh, well, then you, you do it."
"3","Leonard: No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it."
"3","Penny: Okay, you can take him for shoes."
"3","Leonard: I just took him for shoes."
"3","Penny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet."
"3","Leonard: Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday."
"3","Penny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come."
"3","Leonard: You’re taking him to Disneyland?"
"3","Penny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?"
"3","Leonard: All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste."
"3","Penny: We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food."
"3","Leonard: All I’m saying is give me a heads-up."
"3","Penny: Okay, whatever."
"3","Leonard: And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes."
"3","Penny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it."
"3","Penny: What’s the problem with Goofy?"
"3","Leonard: Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto."
"3","Raj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?"
"3","Howard: Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk about."
"3","Penny: We’re home."
"3","Leonard: It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?"
"3","Sheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic."
"3","Leonard: I was going to see that with him."
"3","Penny: How was I supposed to know that?"
"3","Sheldon: It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you."
"3","Leonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call."
"3","Penny: I know, I know."
"3","Sheldon: I can still eat."
"3","Penny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth."
"3","Sheldon: Okay, but just don’t fight"
"3","Leonard: We’re not fighting."
"3","Penny: Just go."
"3","Leonard: Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?"
"3","Sheldon: Thank you, Penny."
"3","Penny: You’re welcome, sweetie."
"3","Leonard: Want a cup of coffee?"
"3","Penny: Oh, um, I should probably get going."
"3","Leonard: Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee."
"3","Penny: Yep, okay."
"3","Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too."
"3","Leonard: What am I smelling?"
"3","Penny: Sheldon’s churro on my shoes."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"3","Penny: He’s such an angel when he’s asleep."
"3","Leonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up."
"3","Penny: I think we can do it."
"3","Leonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?"
"3","Penny: No, be friends. You and me."
"3","Leonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely."
"3","Penny: Good. I’m glad."
"3","Leonard: Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex."
"3","Penny: Good night, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around."
"3","Sheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no."
"3","Series 03 Episode 21 – The Plimpton Stimulation"
"3","Scene: The university cafeteria."
"3","Sheldon: Hold."
"3","Raj: What?"
"3","Sheldon: Explain your sneeze."
"3","Raj: I’m sorry?"
"3","Sheldon: Do you have allergies?"
"3","Raj: No."
"3","Sheldon: Is there too much pepper on your salad?"
"3","Raj: I don’t put pepper on salads."
"3","Sheldon: I’ve heard enough. Sit over there."
"3","Raj: Oh, come on. I don’t want to sit by myself."
"3","Sheldon: That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled."
"3","Raj: Guys, help me."
"3","Howard: Sheldon, come on."
"3","Leonard: Yeah, it’s just one sneeze. (Raj sneezes) You’re on your own."
"3","Howard: See you, buddy."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment."
"3","Leonard: When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?"
"3","Sheldon: Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."
"3","Howard: Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?"
"3","Sheldon: Sarcasm?"
"3","Howard: Yes, but mixed with genuine concern."
"3","Sheldon: For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton."
"3","Raj: The cosmological physicist from Princeton?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university."
"3","Leonard: Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!"
"3","Sheldon: I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto."
"3","Leonard: Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?"
"3","Sheldon: My room, of course."
"3","Raj: Holy crap! (Through napkin) Holy crap!"
"3","Howard: Yeah, um, I have a two-part question."
"3","Sheldon: Go ahead."
"3","Howard: A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?"
"3","Sheldon: A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
"3","Howard: So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?"
"3","Raj: When can I sit with you again?"
"3","Sheldon: When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics."
"3","Leonard: I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton."
"3","Raj: I can’t believe they let him into Canada."
"3","Howard: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where’s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down."

"3","Scene: The lobby"
"3","Penny: Hey, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?"
"3","Penny: What? What are you doing with, what?"
"3","Sheldon: The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject."
"3","Penny: Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?"
"3","Sheldon: I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days."
"3","Penny: Oh. What?"
"3","Sheldon: I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."
"3","Penny: Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?"
"3","Sheldon: Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?"
"3","Penny: Oh, no, no, no, no. I’m not flabbergasted. I’m puzzled. Yeah, let’s go with puzzled."
"3","Sheldon: A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber."
"3","Penny: Female jibber jabber?"
"3","Sheldon: Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina."
"3","Penny: Oh, they’re not my friends."
"3","Sheldon: I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs."
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Leonard: She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?"
"3","Sheldon: Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event."
"3","Leonard: Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer."
"3","Elizabeth: Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I’d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn’t confuse it with what I’d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I’d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello."
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Elizabeth: Nice to finally meet you in person."
"3","Sheldon: I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
"3","Leonard: Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonard, I live"
"3","here, you’re brilliant."
"3","Sheldon: I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist."
"3","Elizabeth: No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I’m sorry, I’m rambling. Hi-lo."
"3","Leonard: Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?"
"3","Sheldon: No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?"
"3","Elizabeth: Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I’d pick the yogurt."
"3","Sheldon: Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles."
"3","Leonard: Look, it’s you."
"3","Scene: A little later."
"3","Elizabeth: Thank you so much for opening up your home to me."
"3","Leonard: Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys."
"3","Elizabeth: I’m so glad you understand."
"3","Sheldon: No, he doesn’t understand. I understand."
"3","Leonard: Well, I understand, too."
"3","Sheldon: You’re just misappropriating my understanding."
"3","Leonard: Oh, (blows a raspberry). I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you."
"3","Sheldon: From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room."
"3","Elizabeth: All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart."
"3","Sheldon: Get it together, man."
"3","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"3","Sheldon: All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."
"3","Elizabeth: Good to know."
"3","Sheldon: In here, you’ll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive."
"3","Elizabeth: What if there’s a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?"
"3","Sheldon: Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?"
"3","Elizabeth: Can I ask a question about your roommate?"
"3","Sheldon: He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?"
"3","Elizabeth: What’s his relationship status?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes."
"3","Elizabeth: Okay."
"3","Sheldon: Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram."
"3","Elizabeth: How thoughtful."
"3","Sheldon: Sleep well, my friend."
"3","Elizabeth: You, too."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck."
"3","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. There is a knock on the door."
"3","Leonard: Yes?"
"3","Elizabeth: I saw your light on."
"3","Leonard: Is everything all right?"
"3","Elizabeth: Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep."
"3","Leonard: Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you."
"3","Elizabeth: I thought you already read it."
"3","Leonard: I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast."
"3","Elizabeth: Aw, you’re smart."
"3","Leonard: Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across."
"3","Elizabeth: What chapter are you on?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, six."
"3","Elizabeth: Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?"
"3","Leonard: Sure."
"3","Elizabeth: I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked."
"3","Leonard: Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way."
"3","Elizabeth: Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see (removes robe) a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble’s constant."
"3","Leonard: Wow. You really make science come alive."
"3","Scene: The living room."
"3","Sheldon: Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test."
"3","Leonard: Morning, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Morning."
"3","Elizabeth: Morning, Sheldon."
"3","Sheldon: Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night."
"3","Elizabeth: More than pleasant."
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself."
"3","Leonard: How do you take your coffee?"
"3","Elizabeth: Black."
"3","Leonard: Okeydoke."
"3","Sheldon (in bathroom): Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas."
"3","Leonard: Something his mother taught him."
"3","Sheldon: All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection."
"3","Elizabeth: That’s very thoughtful, but I think I’ll finish my coffee first."
"3","Sheldon: Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
"3","Penny: Oh, good, you’re up. Look, my car won’t start. I need a ride to work."
"3","Sheldon: Did you once again ignore your check engine light?"
"3","Penny: No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light."
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."
"3","Leonard: Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
"3","Penny: Hello."
"3","Elizabeth: Hi."
"3","Penny: Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine."
"3","Elizabeth: Nice to meet you."
"3","Penny: Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?"
"3","Elizabeth: Yes, very much."
"3","Penny: Good."
"3","Sheldon: Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him."
"3","Elizabeth: Excuse me."
"3","Leonard: Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car."
"3","Penny: Hang on."
"3","Leonard: Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?"
"3","Penny: We just broke up."
"3","Leonard: What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?"
"3","Penny: Not as good as you apparently."
"3","Leonard: I, um, I don’t follow."
"3","Penny: You know what? It’s, it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it."
"3","Leonard: Well, now…"
"3","Sheldon: Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do."
"3","Penny: I’m not recommending it. I’m saying it already happened."
"3","Sheldon: That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: Well…"
"3","Sheldon: No."
"3","Leonard: Come on. It wasn’t my fault."
"3","Sheldon: The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?"
"3","Penny: You know what? I’m just gonna take the bus to work."
"3","Leonard: Penny, I can still drive you."
"3","Penny: Oh, no, no, it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant."
"3","Sheldon: I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal."
"3","Leonard: I didn’t betray Penny."
"3","Sheldon: Not Penny, me!"
"3","Leonard: How am I betraying you?"
"3","Sheldon: Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, I guess I did."
"3","Scene: The cafeteria. Raj drinks from a hip flask."
"3","Howard: What the hell are you doing?"
"3","Raj: Relax, it’s Nyquil."
"3","Leonard: You still have a cold?"
"3","Raj: Maybe, but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine."
"3","Leonard: Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night."
"3","Raj: Did you get a cold, too?"
"3","Leonard: No, but I was awake all night."
"3","Howard: If you want, I can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills."
"3","Raj: She won’t notice they’re missing?"
"3","Howard: She doesn’t know she takes them."
"3","Leonard: No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues."
"3","Raj: Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?"
"3","Leonard: No."
"3","Howard: Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?"
"3","Howard: ‘Cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart."
"3","Leonard: Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person."
"3","Raj: Did you get a Japanese love pillow?"
"3","Howard: How is a Japanese love pillow another person?"
"3","Raj: It is if you love her and give her a name."
"3","Sheldon: Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali"
"3","Raj: Hi."
"3","Sheldon: And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz."
"3","Howard: Hi."
"3","Raj: I’m a big fan of your work."
"3","Elizabeth: Thank you."
"3","Sheldon: And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter."
"3","Leonard: Hey, you."
"3","Elizabeth: Hey, you."
"3","Leonard: Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?"
"3","Elizabeth: You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?"
"3","Leonard: Sure. Black, right?"
"3","Elizabeth: Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet."
"3","Leonard: Coming right up."
"3","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"3","Howard: What do you mean what? It’s Halo night."
"3","Raj: I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away."
"3","Howard: That’s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom’s chicken soup."
"3","Raj: I’m not hungry."
"3","Elizabeth: Don’t send him away. Let him in."
"3","Howard: Who’s that"
"3","Raj: I bought a parrot."
"3","Howard: Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?"
"3","Elizabeth: Hi. Howard, right?"
"3","Howard: Uh, yeah."
"3","Elizabeth: Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?"
"3","Howard: Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master."
"3","Elizabeth: Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don’t have enough money to pay you. So we’ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement."
"3","Howard: Beg pardon?"
"3","Elizabeth: You two figure out the details, I’m going to go change into something I don’t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh."
"3","Howard: What the frak?"
"3","Raj: Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend."
"3","Howard: We broke up weeks ago."
"3","Raj: Why didn’t you say anything?"
"3","Howard: I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time."
"3","Leonard: Hey, who’s ready for Halo?"
"3","Raj: Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!"
"3","Howard: He’s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is."
"3","Leonard: I don’t understand."
"3","Elizabeth: Oh, good. Leonard’s here."
"3","Raj: Good?"
"3","Leonard: Elizabeth? What’s going on?"
"3","Elizabeth: What’s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don’t have enough money to pay any of you."
"3","Leonard: Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?"
"3","Howard: Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum."
"3","Raj: Okay, show of hands. Who’s up for this? (Only Howard raises his hand.)"
"3","Leonard: We’ll all be naked in front of each other."
"3","Howard: I’m out."
"3","Elizabeth: Everybody ready?"
"3","Raj: Follow my lead. Almost. We’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance."
"3","Elizabeth: Oh, good. It’s so much better when everyone commits."
"3","Raj: Run. Run, run, run. Don’t look back."
"3","Leonard: I thought we had something special."
"3","Raj (locks door): So, you say you can’t pay your rent?"
"3","Scene: The lobby."
"3","Penny: Oh, Leonard?"
"3","Leonard: Hey."
"3","Penny: I found these in the dryer. I’m assuming they belong to Sheldon."
"3","Leonard: Thanks. It’s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."
"3","Penny: You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, I wanted to explain."
"3","Penny: Well, you don’t owe me an explanation."
"3","Leonard: I don’t?"
"3","Penny: No, you don’t."
"3","Leonard: So you’re not judging me?"
"3","Penny: Oh, I’m judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don’t owe me an explanation."
"3","Leonard: Nevertheless, I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did."
"3","Penny: I’m listening."
"3","Leonard: She let me."
"3","Series 03 Episode 22 – The Staircase Implementation"
"3","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"3","Penny: Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet."
"3","Leonard (voice off): It’s just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!"
"3","Sheldon: (voice off): Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam."
"3","Leonard (voice off): Yes, if we lived in a teakettle."
"3","Sheldon: (voice off): This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement."
"3","Leonard (voice off): Aw, screw the roommate agreement!"
"3","Sheldon: (voice off): No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you."
"3","Leonard (voice off): You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat."
"3","Sheldon: (voice off): I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!"
"3","Penny (after a knock on the door): Who is it?"
"3","Leonard: Leonard."
"3","Penny: Hang on."
"3","Leonard: Can I sleep on your couch tonight?"
"3","Penny: Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy."
"3","Leonard: You heard that, huh?"
"3","Penny: Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy."
"3","Leonard: So you agree, he’s nuts."
"3","Penny: Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him."
"3","Leonard: Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him."
"3","Penny: Oh, I do not believe that."
"3","Leonard: You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. (Flasback: The lobby) I’d just started at the university."
"3","Past Leonard: Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldon Cooper’s apartment."
"3","Man with a box: Oh, I bet you’re here to check out the room for rent."
"3","Past Leonard: Yeah."
"3","Man: Run away, dude."
"3","Past Leonard: What?"
"3","Man: Run fast, run far. (End of flashback.)"
"3","Leonard: That should have been my first clue."
"3","Scene: Moments later."
"3","Penny: So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?"
"3","Leonard: For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look."
"3","Penny: Well, yeah, he’d been living with Sheldon."
"3","Leonard: Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback. Past Leonard is getting out of the lift). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door."
"3","Large Black Transvestite: Yeah?"
"3","Past Leonard: Dr. Cooper?"
"3","Transvestite: No, you want the crazy guy across the hall."
"3","Leonard: In retrospect, that was clue number two."
"3","Past Sheldon: Yes?"
"3","Past Leonard: I’m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…"
"3","Past Sheldon: I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?"
"3","Past Sheldon: You said you’re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?"
"3","Past Leonard: Uh, radon?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Are you asking me or telling me?"
"3","Past Leonard: Telling you? Telling you."
"3","Past Sheldon: All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?"
"3","Past Leonard: Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk."
"3","Past Sheldon: Correct. You’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter."
"3","Past Leonard (Enters apartment. It is bare except for two lawn chairs, a television and some whiteboards): Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?"
"3","Past Sheldon: That depends."
"3","Past Leonard: I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?"
"3","Past Sheldon: No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers."
"3","Past Leonard: There’s three?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat."
"3","Past Leonard: Okay."
"3","Past Sheldon: No! That’s where I sit!"
"3","Past Leonard: What’s the difference?"
"3","Past Sheldon: This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs."
"3","Past Leonard: Can you do that?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics."
"3","Past Leonard: Uh, yeah, experimental physics."
"3","Past Sheldon: Hmm."
"3","Past Leonard: What is that?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?"
"3","Past Leonard: Yes."
"3","Past Sheldon: And you have a vehicle?"
"3","Past Leonard: A car, yeah."
"3","Past Sheldon: And you’ll be willing to drive me?"
"3","Past Leonard: Well, can’t you drive?"
"3","Past Sheldon: I can. I choose not to."
"3","Past Leonard: Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Why don’t you let me do this."
"3","Past Leonard: Come on, I just asked."
"3","Past Sheldon: Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
"3","Past Leonard: Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge."
"3","Past Sheldon: That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment."
"3","Past Leonard: Oh, good. I passed the barriers."
"3","Past Sheldon: The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?"
"3","Past Leonard: Uh, I guess."
"3","Past Sheldon: This isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?"
"3","Past Leonard: When I have to."
"3","Past Sheldon: When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies."
"3","Past Leonard: I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight."
"3","Past Sheldon: I can’t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty."
"3","Past Leonard: Fine. I’ll take it."
"3","Past Sheldon: Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!"
"3","Past Leonard: Is this it?"
"3","Past Sheldon: No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room."
"3","Past Leonard: So where do you sleep?"
"3","Past Sheldon: I don’t understand."
"3","Past Leonard: If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke."
"3","Past Sheldon: Do you do this often?"
"3","Past Leonard: On occasion."
"3","Past Sheldon: Your room. You may want to repaint. (End of Flashback)"
"3","Penny: Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?"
"3","Leonard: No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. (Flashback: The apartment)"
"3","Past Sheldon: Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon’s brilliant new series Firefly."
"3","Past Leonard: Does that really need to be in the agreement?"
"3","Past Sheldon: We might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that’s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure."
"3","Past Leonard: We have a flag?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds."
"3","Past Sheldon: Well that’s disappointing. (End of flashback.)"
"3","Penny: Why on earth did you agree to all that?"
"3","Leonard: It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way."
"3","Penny: Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you."
"3","Leonard: Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard’s bedroom.)"
"3","Past Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?"
"3","Past Leonard: Shh. Just pretend we’re not here."
"3","Past Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?Leonard?"
"3","Past Leonard: I’m sure he’ll go away."
"3","Past Sheldon: I’m just going to keep knocking till you answer. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?"
"3","Past Leonard: What do you want? I didn’t say come in!"
"3","Past Sheldon: You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”"
"3","Past Leonard: I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago."
"3","Joyce Kim: That’s it! I’m out of here!"
"3","Past Leonard: But, Joyce, come on."
"3","Past Sheldon: 12 hours? (End of flashback.)"
"3","Penny: Oh, my God."
"3","Leonard: Do I get some sympathy now?"
"3","Penny: A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?"
"3","Leonard: Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim."
"3","Penny: Why not?"
"3","Leonard: Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret."
"3","Penny: What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?"
"3","Leonard: As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have."
"3","Penny: So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?"
"3","Leonard: That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator."
"3","Penny: Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in."
"3","Leonard: It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work… (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)"
"3","Past Sheldon: What is going on here?"
"3","Past Leonard: Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too."
"3","Past Howard: Hey."
"3","Past Raj: Hey."
"3","Past Sheldon: I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?"
"3","Past Howard: I can’t speak for these guys, but I’m sitting on my tushie. It’s a joke."
"3","Past Leonard: Yeah, not a good idea."
"3","Past Raj: Tushie is buttocks, right?"
"3","Past Howard: Right."
"3","Past Raj: Hilarious."
"3","Past Sheldon: Explain the couch."
"3","Past Leonard: Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up."
"3","Past Sheldon: But what’s wrong with the furniture we have?"
"3","Past Leonard: They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company."
"3","Past Sheldon: Did it occur to you that was by design?"
"3","Past Leonard: According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas."
"3","Past Sheldon: But you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach."
"3","Past Leonard: I did notify you."
"3","Past Sheldon: Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter."
"3","Past Leonard: What am I doing in your spam folder?"
"3","Past Sheldon: I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny."
"3","Past Raj: Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. (End of flashback.)"
"3","Penny: Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?"
"3","Leonard: I’m getting to it. (Back to flashback.)"
"3","Past Sheldon: I assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs."
"3","Past Raj: Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Yes."
"3","Past Howard: And you just assume you’re always right?"
"3","Past Sheldon: It’s not an assumption. Change seats with me."
"3","Past Raj: Why?"
"3","Past Sheldon: I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head."
"3","Past Raj: Fine."
"3","Past Leonard: Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!"
"3","Past Sheldon: We don’t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment."
"3","Past Leonard: Why not?"
"3","Past Sheldon: Because no one likes Babylon 5."
"3","Past Leonard: I like it."
"3","Past Raj: Me, too."
"3","Past Howard: So do I."
"3","Past Leonard: There you go– three against one."
"3","Past Sheldon: They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me."
"3","Past Leonard: But I said no to that."
"3","Past Sheldon: And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me."
"3","Past Howard: Why?"
"3","Past Sheldon: There’s a draft on my neck over here."
"3","Past Howard: So, I get the draft?"
"3","Past Sheldon: You’re protected by your turtleneck."
"3","Past Howard: Fine. And it’s a dickey."
"3","Past Sheldon: Hmm, I’m still not comfortable. Of course. There’s too many people here."
"3","Past Leonard: We can fix that. Let’s leave."
"3","Past Howard: Yeah, we can go over to my place."
"3","Past Sheldon: Wait. Let me get my jacket."
"3","Past Howard: You’re not going with us."
"3","Past Sheldon: Why not?"
"3","Past Raj: You’re the guy we’re trying to get away from."
"3","Past Sheldon: Oh. Well, in that case, I don’t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. (End of flashback.)"
"3","Penny: Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room."
"3","Leonard: Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?"
"3","Penny: Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard’s bedroom.)"
"3","Mrs Wolowitz: Howard, are you having a playdate?"
"3","Past Howard: I don’t have playdates! I have colleagues!"
"3","Mrs Wolowitz: Do their parents know they’re here?"
"3","Past Howard: No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!"
"3","Past Leonard: That your dad?"
"3","Past Howard: She grows any more hair on her face, yes."
"3","Past Leonard: Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?"
"3","Past Howard: Three. I designed the engine myself."
"3","Past Raj: Cool. Can it break Mach 1?"
"3","Past Howard: Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on."
"3","Past Leonard: Oh, this just might be your lucky day."
"3","Mrs Wolowitz: Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!"
"3","Past Howard: I haven’t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! (End of flashback.)"
"3","Penny: So, why was it his lucky day?"
"3","Leonard: Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."
"3","Penny: What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?"
"3","Leonard: Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment."
"3","Penny: Are we ever going to get to the elevator?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. (Flashback.)"
"3","Past Leonard: The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust."
"3","Past Howard: Nice."
"3","Past Raj: Cool."
"3","Past Sheldon: Won’t work."
"3","Past Leonard: Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work."
"3","Past Sheldon: You don’t see your mistake, do you?"
"3","Past Leonard: There’s no mistake."
"3","Past Sheldon: This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model."
"3","Past Leonard: Well, I’ve adjusted the formula."
"3","Past Sheldon: Not correctly."
"3","Past Leonard: Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh."
"3","Past Howard: What’s happening?"
"3","Past Leonard: A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!"
"3","Past Howard: You’re waiting for the elevator?"
"3","Past Leonard: Oh. Right."
"3","Past Raj: Wait. It’s here."
"3","Past Sheldon: Give me that. (Takes the rocket fuel. Puts it in elevator. Presses button and jumps out.)"
"3","Past Leonard: What’d you do that for? I had plenty of time. (Elevator explodes.)"
"3","Past Sheldon: You’re welcome. (End of flashback.)"
"3","Leonard: Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security."
"3","Penny: Okay, so, basically, you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?"
"3","Leonard: So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?"
"3","Penny: Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. (Flashback. Penny is in her bedroom, sitting on the bed with a guy, looking at a pregnancy tester.)"
"3","Past Penny: Not pregnant. Yes!"
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3"," "
"3","Sheldon: Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system."
"3","Leonard: Hey."
"3","Sheldon: Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?"
"3","Leonard: Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology."
"3","Sheldon: There’s doubt?"
"3","Leonard: I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it."
"3","Sheldon: That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right."
"3","Leonard: Okay, I’m sorry."
"3","Sheldon: There you go."
"3","Leonard: So, we’re good?"
"3","Sheldon: Good what?"
"3","Leonard: Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?"
"3","Sheldon: Go ahead."
"3","Television voice: Up next Babylon 5."
"3","Leonard (voice off): You’re not even watching!"
"3","Sheldon (voice off): I can hear it!"
"3","Leonard (voice off): Oh, so the dialogue offends you?"
"3","Sheldon (voice off): I would hardly call that dialogue!"
"3","Leonard (voice off): You’re insane, you know that?!"
"3","Sheldon (voice off): Don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know I’ll do it!"
"3","Series 03 Episode 23 – The Lunar Excitation"
"3","Scene: On the roof of the apartment building."
"3","Leonard: Okay, we’ve got power to the laser."
"3","Sheldon: I should’ve brought an umbrella."
"3","Leonard: What for? It’s not going to rain."
"3","Sheldon: I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility."
"3","Howard: That’s a bazinga, right?"
"3","Sheldon: One of my best, don’t you think?"
"3","Leonard: Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility."
"3","Howard: You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows."
"3","Raj: It’s not like that, I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey’s Anatomy."
"3","Sheldon: Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?"
"3","Leonard: Relax, it’s just a dirty sock."
"3","Sheldon: How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?"
"3","Leonard: Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks."
"3","Sheldon: Not my world."
"3","Leonard: Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny."
"3","Sheldon: I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object."
"3","Raj: Why don’t you ask her to come up?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…"
"3","Howard: She dumped you?"
"3","Leonard: She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship."
"3","Sheldon: I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location."
"3","Howard: Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye."
"3","Leonard: Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home."
"3","Howard: If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now."
"3","Raj: Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong."
"3","Credits sequence."
"3","Scene: Penny’s door."
"3","Penny: Oh, hi. What’s going on?"
"3","Leonard: We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon."
"3","Penny: I’m sorry, what?"
"3","Leonard: It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it."
"3","Man in Penny’s Apartment: That makes no sense."
"3","Penny: Um…"
"3","Man: How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There’s no gravity."
"3","Penny: Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard."
"3","Zack: Hey."
"3","Leonard: Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time."
"3","Penny: Yeah, maybe."
"3","Zack: Hey, I want to see this laser thing."
"3","Penny: Oh, but what about the party?"
"3","Zack: It’s a surprise party, doesn’t matter when we get there."
"3","Penny: Oh, right."
"3","Leonard: Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?"
"3","Zack: My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory."
"3","Leonard: Your company?"
"3","Zack: Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs."
"3","Leonard: So, menus."
"3","Zack: I know it sounds easy but there’s a lot of science that goes in designing them."
"3","Scene: The roof."
"3","Howard: Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one."
"3","Penny: Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack."
"3","Sheldon: Hello."
"3","Zack: Whoa! Is that the laser? It’s bitchin’."
"3","Sheldon: Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’."
"3","Zack: Well, mission accomplished."
"3","Leonard: Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
"3","Penny: Oh! That’s very cool."
"3","Zack: One question. How can you be sure it won’t blow up?"
"3","Leonard: The laser?"
"3","Zack: The moon."
"3","Sheldon: See, now this is a man for Penny."
"3","Leonard: Uh, that’s a great question, Zack."
"3","Sheldon: No, it’s not."
"3","Penny: Sheldon! Play nice."
"3","Sheldon: Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question."
"3","Leonard: Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun."
"3","Zack: Smart."
"3","Leonard: Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
"3","Zack: Naked."
"3","Leonard: Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses."
"3","Zack: Cool, it’s gonna be in 3-D?"
"3","Howard: Preparing to fire laser at the moon."
"3","Sheldon: Make it so."
"3","Howard: There it is. There’s the spike!"
"3","Leonard: 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!"
"3","Zack: That’s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?"
"3","Leonard: Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
"3","Zack: What species is that?"
"3","Sheldon: I was wrong. Penny can do better."
"3","Penny: Okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun."
"3","Zack: Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?"
"3","Penny: No, just keep walking."
"3","Sheldon: He must be very skilled at coitus."
"3","Scene: The apartment."
"3","Raj: I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."
"3","Howard: Horse."
"3","Raj: What?"
"3","Howard: The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores."
"3","Raj: That’s disgusting, dude."
"3","Howard: No, it’s not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found."
"3","Leonard: No, thanks."
"3","Howard: You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody."
"3","Leonard: Have they found a match for you?"
"3","Howard: Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left."
"3","Sheldon: I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down."
"3","Leonard: Why not?"
"3","Sheldon: All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to."
"3","Leonard: I’ll help you."
"3","Sheldon: Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night."
"3","Raj: You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating."
"3","Howard: Yeah, right."
"3","Raj: No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife."
"3","Howard: He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts."
"3","Raj: Okay, we’ll call that plan B."
"3","Scene: The apartment. It is night and the lights are off. Knocking."
"3","Leonard: Coming!"
"3","Penny: Damn you, you rat bastard."
"3","Leonard: Are you drunk?"
"3","Penny: Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!"
"3","Leonard: How did I ruin him?"
"3","Penny: ‘Cause in the olden days, I never would’ve known he was so stupid."
"3","Leonard: Come on, he wasn’t that stupid."
"3","Penny: Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!"
"3","Leonard: Okay, yeah, he’s stupid."
"3","Penny: He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers."
"3","Leonard: How is that my fault?"
"3","Penny: You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me."
"3","Leonard: Where are we going?"
"3","Penny: We’re gonna have sex."
"3","Leonard: Why? I mean, okay."
"3","Sheldon: What’s going on?"
"3","Penny: Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud."
"3","Sheldon: Oh! Not this again."
"3","Scene: The next morning."
"3","Sheldon: In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny."
"3","Penny: What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?"
"3","Sheldon: When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?"
"3","Penny: Oh, thanks, I’m not hungry."
"3","Sheldon: FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night."
"3","Penny: Yeah, sorry about that."
"3","Sheldon: As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context."
"3","Penny: Oh, God."
"3","Sheldon: Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: How many times have I asked you not to do that?"
"3","Sheldon: Counting this instance? 317."
"3","Leonard: Where’s Penny?"
"3","Sheldon: She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order."
"3","Leonard: I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye."
"3","Sheldon: Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?"
"3","Leonard: I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
"3","Sheldon: I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter."
"3","Leonard: Oh, hey."
"3","Penny: Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift."
"3","Leonard: Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?"
"3","Penny: Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet."
"3","Leonard: Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
"3","Penny: Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me."
"3","Leonard: Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always."
"3","Penny: Leonard, last night was a mistake."
"3","Leonard: When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
"3","Penny: Look, I’m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?"
"3","Leonard: No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing."
"3","Penny: Oh, God!"
"3","Leonard: So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?"
"3","Penny: Look, I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?"
"3","Leonard: How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson."
"3","Mrs Gunderson: Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?"
"3","Raj: Holy crap."
"3","Howard: What?"
"3","Raj: We finally have proof that aliens walk among us."
"3","Howard: Excuse me?"
"3","Raj: The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon."
"3","Howard: You’re kidding. An actual woman?"
"3","Raj: Yeah, look. Breasts and everything."
"3","Howard: Trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman."
"3","Raj: Since when?"
"3","Howard: I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon."
"3","Leonard: Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?"
"3","Raj: Do you know what he’s talking about?"
"3","Howard: Nope. Why don’t you ask him?"
"3","Raj: Leonard, what are you talking about?"
"3","Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it."
"3","Raj: That was a lousy suggestion."
"3","Howard: Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…"
"3","Scene: A building corridor."
"3","Leonard: If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can’t do it."
"3","Leslie Winkle: Hello?"
"3","Leonard: Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie."
"3","Leslie: Leonard Hofstadter. What’re you doing here?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, I know! It’s been a while!"
"3","Leslie: Yeah, 18 months."
"3","Leonard: Right. Right. So how you doing?"
"3","Leslie: Fine. You?"
"3","Leonard: Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?"
"3","Leslie: Yeah."
"3","Leonard: Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
"3","Leslie: What happened? Blondie dumped you?"
"3","Leslie: Right."
"3","Leonard: Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them."
"3","Leslie: Uh-huh."
"3","Leonard: So, what do you say?"
"3","Leslie: Let me think about it. (Slams door.)"
"3","Leonard: She’s not coming back."
"3","Raj: Uh-oh. She wants to meet us."
"3","Howard: Not us. Him."
"3","Raj: Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her."
"3","Howard: Well, him about to find out about her."
"3","Raj: Really? Us gonna tell him?"
"3","Sheldon: Who’s going to tell whom about what?"
"3","Howard: Sheldon. Hey."
"3","Raj: Hi."
"3","Sheldon: Your surprise confuses me. I live here."
"3","Howard: Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?"
"3","Sheldon: Be more specific."
"3","Howard: Four thirty."
"3","Sheldon: That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning."
"3","Sheldon: It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need."
"3","Raj: Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking."
"3","Howard: Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?"
"3","Sheldon: I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."
"3","Raj: But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler."
"3","Sheldon: Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
"3","Howard: And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”"
"3","Raj: Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum."
"3","Howard: Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?"
"3","Sheldon: Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you."
"3","Raj: Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years."
"3","Sheldon: He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust."
"3","Howard: Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later."
"3","Sheldon: I don’t drink coffee."
"3","Howard: All right, you can have a hot chocolate."
"3","Sheldon: As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them."
"3","Howard: Why?"
"3","Sheldon: What’s life without whimsy?"
"3","Howard: Okay, I’m out."
"3","Raj: Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever."
"3","Sheldon: You’re bluffing."
"3","Raj: Are you willing to risk it?"
"3","Sheldon: Curse you."
"3","Scene: The hallway. Leonard is finishing off a bottle of spirits. He opens the lift and drops the bottle inside."
"3","Leonard: Thirty feet."
"3","Penny: Oh. Hey, Leonard."
"3","Leonard: I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!"
"3","Penny: Are you drunk?"
"3","Leonard: Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!"
"3","Penny: Are you out of your mind?!"
"3","Leonard: I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here."
"3","Scene: A coffee shop."
"3","Sheldon: In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
"3","Raj: You don’t know we’re wrong yet."
"3","Sheldon: Haughty derision it is."
"3","Amy: Excuse me. I’m Amy Farrah Fowler. You’re Sheldon Cooper."
"3","Sheldon: Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock."
"3","Amy: If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year."
"3","Sheldon: Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church."
"3","Amy: I don’t object to the concept of a deity, but I’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance."
"3","Sheldon: Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas."
"3","Amy: Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table."
"3","Sheldon: May I buy you a beverage?"
"3","Amy: Tepid water, please."
"3","Howard: Good God, what have we done?"
