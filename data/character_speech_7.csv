"7","Scene: On the deck of a ship on the North Sea, in the middle of a storm. Leonard is on a sat-phone."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?"
"7","Sheldon (in the apartment): Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but this is important."
"7","(in the apartment)"
"7","Leonard: What is it?"
"7","Sheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case."
"7","Leonard: So?"
"7","Sheldon: So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?"
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here."
"7","Sheldon: You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?"
"7","Leonard: What was what?"
"7","Sheldon: This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken."
"7","Leonard: Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k… (Leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by a huge tentacle. Sheldon wakes up in bed.)"
"7","(Leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by a huge tentacle. Sheldon wakes up in bed.)"
"7","Sheldon: No!"
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment door."
"7","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Penny: What’s the matter?"
"7","Sheldon: Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed."
"7","Penny: Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?"
"7","Sheldon: To be honest, I did."
"7","Penny: Aw."
"7","Sheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it."
"7","Penny: Good night."
"7","Sheldon: No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it."
"7","Penny: You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you."
"7","Sheldon: You’re welcome. Good night."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Raj: I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all."
"7","Howard: I’m proud of you."
"7","Raj: Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good."
"7","Sheldon: Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way."
"7","Raj: Is that true?"
"7","Sheldon: Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace."
"7","Howard: Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new."
"7","Raj: How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie."
"7","Howard: Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie."
"7","Raj: You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?"
"7","Howard: Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you."
"7","Raj: You would do that for me?"
"7","Howard: Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy."
"7","Raj: Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?"
"7","Sheldon: I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it."
"7","Scene: A hotel room."
"7","Bernadette (on phone): Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here."
"7","(on phone)"
"7","Amy (on phone): Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs."
"7","Bernadette: The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun."
"7","Amy: Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs."
"7","Bernadette: Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland."
"7","Amy: Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Sheldon: Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…"
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess."
"7","Penny: Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?"
"7","Sheldon: You overestimate his significance in my life."
"7","Penny: Mmm."
"7","Sheldon: Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? (Taps out No in morse code on the table)"
"7","(Taps out No in morse code on the table)"
"7","Penny: Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I try."
"7","Penny: All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with."
"7","Sheldon: Great. I’ll go first."
"7","Penny: Okay."
"7","Sheldon: By the way, how are you with zippers?"
"7","Penny: Why?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus."
"7","Scene: The mixer party."
"7","Raj: Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting."
"7","Girl: It is. You can download my paper off the university server."
"7","Raj: I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well."
"7","Girl: I will."
"7","Raj: All right."
"7","Howard: How’d it go?"
"7","Raj: Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas."
"7","Howard: Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment."
"7","Raj: Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed."
"7","Howard: I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad."
"7","Raj: That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones."
"7","Mrs Davis: Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali."
"7","Howard: Mrs. Davis, nice to see you."
"7","Raj: You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins."
"7","Mrs Davis: Okay."
"7","Raj: So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable."
"7","Howard: It was better when you couldn’t talk to women."
"7","Scene: The hotel bar."
"7","Bernadette: I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory."
"7","Amy: Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag."
"7","Bernadette: To the advancement of science."
"7","Amy: And to the sick and dying who make it possible."
"7","Bernadette: This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys."
"7","Amy: Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation."
"7","Waiter: From the two gentlemen at the bar."
"7","Amy: Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much."
"7","Bernadette: Be cool."
"7","Amy: You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny."
"7","Bernadette: You’re right. Thank you."
"7","Sheldon: Ooh. Bad move."
"7","Penny: Really? Why?"
"7","Sheldon: My queen can now take your rook from below."
"7","Penny: So that means I lose, right? It’s over?"
"7","Sheldon: If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun."
"7","Penny: Okay, let’s take a break."
"7","Sheldon: We’re all out of alcohol."
"7","Penny: I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much."
"7","Sheldon: Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island."
"7","Penny: I’m calling him."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone."
"7","Leonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing): Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?"
"7","(on board boat, at a party, dancing)"
"7","Penny: Leonard?"
"7","Leonard: Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny."
"7","Everybody: Hi, Penny!"
"7","Penny: Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time."
"7","Leonard: Best time of my life."
"7","Sheldon: Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?"
"7","Leonard: Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!"
"7","Penny: Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you."
"7","Random voice: Iceberg!"
"7","Leonard: Uh-oh, hang on."
"7","Sheldon: Are you in danger?"
"7","Leonard: No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!"
"7","Everybody: Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!"
"7","Penny: Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk."
"7","Sheldon: You were."
"7","Amy: So what happened? How’d it go?"
"7","Bernadette: It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available."
"7","Amy: So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?"
"7","Bernadette: Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you."
"7","Amy: And why would no one blame me?"
"7","Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m saying."
"7","Amy: Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon."
"7","Bernadette: Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight."
"7","Amy: No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that."
"7","Bernadette: I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon."
"7","Amy: And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?"
"7","Bernadette: Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?"
"7","Amy: We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo."
"7","Bernadette: Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?"
"7","Amy: Sure."
"7","Bernadette: Thanks."
"7","Amy: Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous."
"7","Penny: I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?"
"7","Sheldon: That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?"
"7","Penny: No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all."
"7","Sheldon: Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health."
"7","Penny: Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?"
"7","Sheldon: Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?"
"7","Penny: No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all."
"7","Penny: This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?"
"7","Penny: Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now."
"7","Sheldon: Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you."
"7","Penny: He did?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes."
"7","Penny: Oh, that’s really sweet."
"7","Sheldon: Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap."
"7","Penny: Well, now I miss him even more."
"7","Sheldon: Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips."
"7","Penny: Thanks."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, seriously?"
"7","Scene: The mixer."
"7","Raj: Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?"
"7","Mrs Davis: What?"
"7","Raj: I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys."
"7","Mrs Davis: Forget about it."
"7","Raj: You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common."
"7","Mrs Davis: Is that right?"
"7","Raj: Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it."
"7","Sheldon: Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will."
"7","Penny: Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess."
"7","Penny: How about we just talk?"
"7","Sheldon: All right. In 4D chess…"
"7","Penny: No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know."
"7","Sheldon: I own nine pairs of pants."
"7","Penny: Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal."
"7","Sheldon: I see. I own nine pairs of underpants."
"7","Penny: How about I go first?"
"7","Sheldon: But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand."
"7","Penny: Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out."
"7","Sheldon: I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you."
"7","Penny: Oh, God."
"7","Sheldon: And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave."
"7","Sheldon: Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not."
"7","Penny: That’s your big revelation?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter."
"7","Penny: Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed."
"7","Sheldon: Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings."
"7","Penny: What did I do?"
"7","Sheldon: I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing."
"7","Penny: I, I didn’t think it was a big deal."
"7","Sheldon: It is to me; that’s the point."
"7","Penny: Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better."
"7","Sheldon: Your apology is accepted."
"7","Penny: Thank you. How about a hug?"
"7","Sheldon: How about a hearty handshake?"
"7","Penny: Come on."
"7","Sheldon: Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla."
"7","Scene: The hotel room."
"7","Bernadette: Good night."
"7","Amy: Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks."
"7","Bernadette: Yeah, that felt nice."
"7","Amy: Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes."
"7","Bernadette: So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?"
"7","Amy: I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two."
"7","Amy: Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan."
"7","Bernadette: Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard."
"7","Amy: Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon."
"7","Both: Good night."
"7","Mrs Davis: All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter."
"7","Raj: Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog."
"7","Mrs Davis: Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night."
"7","Raj: Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person."
"7","Mrs Davis: Are you hitting on me?"
"7","Raj: No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me."
"7","Mrs Davis: You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali."
"7","Raj: Good night."
"7","Howard: Looks like she accepted your apology."
"7","Raj: And then some. I think we had a moment."
"7","Howard: Oh, please, you did not have a moment."
"7","Raj: Who died and made you king of moments?"
"7","Howard: Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment."
"7","Raj: There was."
"7","Howard: There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?"
"7","Raj: I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her."
"7","Howard: So nothing."
"7","Raj: No, not a thing."
"7","Scene: A bathroom shower."
"7","Penny (acting): Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape."
"7","(acting)"
"7","Leonard (on ship): That is my girlfriend. I swear to God."
"7","(on ship)"
"7","Everyone (on ship): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!"
"7","Penny: Aaaaaaah!"
"7","Series 07 Episode 02 – The Deception Verification"
"7","Scene: The stairwell"
"7","Sheldon: And here’s another interesting weather fact."
"7","Penny: Another? Great."
"7","Sheldon: Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer."
"7","Penny: Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere."
"7","Sheldon: Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store."
"7","Penny: You know, I will miss this."
"7","Sheldon: I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence."
"7","Penny: I won’t."
"7","Sheldon: That criticism will come later in your report card."
"7","Penny: Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card."
"7","Leonard (in Penny’s apartment): Hello."
"7","(in Penny’s apartment)"
"7","Penny (screams): Leonard! Hi!"
"7","(screams)"
"7","Leonard: Keep your voice down."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday."
"7","Leonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you."
"7","Penny: Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?"
"7","Leonard: I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone."
"7","Penny: Oh, that is so romantic."
"7","Leonard: Uh, sure, that’s why I did it."
"7","Penny: Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here."
"7","Sheldon (off): Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys."
"7","(off)"
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The comic book store."
"7","Sheldon: Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something."
"7","Stuart: Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate."
"7","Stuart: Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue."
"7","Sheldon: Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart."
"7","Stuart: Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector."
"7","Sheldon: I’m a real collector. How rare is it?"
"7","Stuart: Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?"
"7","Sheldon: Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman."
"7","Howard: What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?"
"7","Raj: Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan."
"7","Howard: Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot."
"7","Raj: Hey, what’s your problem?"
"7","Howard: I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on."
"7","Raj: Why are you on a diet?"
"7","Howard: I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section."
"7","Raj: Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost."
"7","Sheldon: Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer."
"7","Stuart: All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun."
"7","Stuart: Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare."
"7","Sheldon: Oh."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Leonard: And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat."
"7","Penny: Ah."
"7","Leonard: And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in."
"7","Penny: Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that’s the pizza."
"7","(Knock on door)"
"7","Leonard: Yep. Here’s some money."
"7","Penny: Thank you."
"7","Leonard: And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee."
"7","Penny: Hey."
"7","Pizza guy: Twenty-two fifty."
"7","Penny: Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change."
"7","Pizza guy: Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs."
"7","Penny: Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food."
"7","Penny: That’s nice."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns."
"7","Penny: Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…"
"7","Sheldon: Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport."
"7","Penny: Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!"
"7","(Toilet flushes)"
"7","Sheldon: What, now, do you have company?"
"7","Penny: No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I can take a look at it."
"7","Penny: Well…"
"7","Sheldon: I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."
"7","Penny: Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom."
"7","Sheldon: That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?"
"7","Penny: Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem."
"7","Sheldon: Of course. Ask a silly question."
"7","Penny: Oh."
"7","Sheldon: That’s odd."
"7","Penny: Um, what?"
"7","Sheldon: There are takeout containers in the trash can."
"7","Penny: So? That’s my dinner from last night."
"7","Sheldon: What’s odd is they’re in the trash can."
"7","Penny: Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself."
"7","I"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!"
"7","Penny: What?"
"7","Sheldon: Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?"
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?"
"7","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"7","Bernadette: Hi, honey."
"7","Howard: Hey."
"7","Bernadette: I made some brownies. You want one?"
"7","Howard: You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage."
"7","Bernadette: We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat."
"7","Howard: Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying."
"7","Bernadette: Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?"
"7","Howard: Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again."
"7","Bernadette: Why can’t she do it?"
"7","Howard: ‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back."
"7","Bernadette: Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?"
"7","Howard: I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?"
"7","Bernadette: This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves."
"7","Howard: Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves."
"7","Bernadette: Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass."
"7","Howard: You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that."
"7","Bernadette: That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon."
"7","Howard: Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time."
"7","Bernadette: It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system."
"7","Howard: I feel so stupid. And fat."
"7","Bernadette: It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?"
"7","Howard: Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Amy: Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language."
"7","Sheldon: Yes, I am."
"7","Amy: Then what does tweepadock mean?"
"7","Sheldon: Uh, elephant?"
"7","Amy: Lucky guess."
"7","Sheldon: I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s."
"7","Amy: What happened?"
"7","Sheldon: I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard."
"7","Amy: What?"
"7","Sheldon: She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions."
"7","Amy: I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity."
"7","Amy: You’re being ridiculous."
"7","Sheldon: Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can."
"7","Amy: Poor Leonard."
"7","Scene: Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door."
"7","Amy: Do you hear anything?"
"7","Sheldon: I hear a woman’s voice."
"7","Amy: Is it Penny?"
"7","Sheldon: No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing."
"7","Amy: Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like."
"7","Sheldon: There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants."
"7","Amy: Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard."
"7","Sheldon: Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act. (Unlocks door)"
"7","(Unlocks door)"
"7","Amy: No, Sheldon, don’t."
"7","Sheldon: Aha."
"7","Penny: What the hell?"
"7","Sheldon: Leonard?"
"7","Penny: Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that."
"7","Sheldon: Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?"
"7","(Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Leonard: I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you."
"7","Leonard: That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying."
"7","Penny: No, he doesn’t."
"7","Leonard: I actually have used those exact words before. In that order."
"7","Sheldon: Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room."
"7","Leonard: The what?"
"7","Sheldon: Amy?"
"7","Amy: Please leave me out of this."
"7","Sheldon: Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore."
"7","Leonard: Come on, I said I was sorry."
"7","Sheldon: No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny."
"7","Penny: It was fine."
"7","Leonard: Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?"
"7","Sheldon: You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?"
"7","Leonard: I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah."
"7","Amy: Hello, sailor."
"7","Penny: Ooh, now we’re talking."
"7","Sheldon: Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts."
"7","Howard: Thanks for coming over."
"7","Raj: No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches."
"7","Howard: Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven."
"7","Raj: Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?"
"7","Howard: Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?"
"7","Raj: Well, it’s kind of hard to tell."
"7","Howard: Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question."
"7","Raj: I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this."
"7","Howard: Seriously?"
"7","Raj: Do you want my help or not?"
"7","Howard: Fine."
"7","Raj: Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing."
"7","Howard: Yeah, they kind of do."
"7","Raj: Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)"
"7","(Grabs his boob)"
"7","Howard: Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive."
"7","Raj: Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe."
"7","(Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in)"
"7","Howard: Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size."
"7","Raj: You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you."
"7","Howard: You think?"
"7","Raj: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky."
"7","Howard: Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie’s ready."
"7","(Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out)"
"7","Raj: Yay."
"7","Leonard: Good morning."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Leonard: So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?"
"7","Sheldon: I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work."
"7","Leonard: Where do you think I would take you?"
"7","Sheldon: Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me."
"7","Leonard: I’m going to work. You can come if you want."
"7","Sheldon: Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt."
"7","Leonard: No, I don’t."
"7","Sheldon: Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true."
"7","Leonard: I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell."
"7","Sheldon: You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?"
"7","Leonard: Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?"
"7","Sheldon: All right, I’ll give you that one."
"7","Leonard: Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?"
"7","Sheldon: I want you to admit that what you did was wrong."
"7","Leonard: Fine. What I did was wrong."
"7","Sheldon: I wish I could believe you."
"7","Leonard: You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying."
"7","Sheldon: You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."
"7","Leonard: Stop it."
"7","Sheldon: Keep it up?"
"7","Leonard: Bye."
"7","Sheldon: Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?"
"7","Scene: The stairwell."
"7","Penny: Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?"
"7","Amy: Driving Sheldon to work."
"7","Penny: He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?"
"7","Amy: Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray."
"7","Penny: I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good."
"7","Sheldon: Thought I heard you out here."
"7","Penny: Hey, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm."
"7","Penny: Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months."
"7","Sheldon: You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating."
"7","Penny: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?"
"7","Amy: Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…"
"7","Sheldon: Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy."
"7","Amy: Really?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. You’re either with me or against me."
"7","Amy: You want to take the bus to work?"
"7","Sheldon: Maybe there’s a third option."
"7","Amy: FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Leonard: So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising."
"7","Howard: That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here."
"7","Sheldon: Howard, Raj. Judas."
"7","Leonard: You know what? You’re a crazy person."
"7","Sheldon: A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army."
"7","Howard: Stop it."
"7","Sheldon: Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes."
"7","Howard: I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it."
"7","Raj: A little loud, dude."
"7","Howard: So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?"
"7","Leonard: Okay."
"7","Sheldon: I suppose so."
"7","Howard: Thank you."
"7","Raj: Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were."
"7","Sheldon: And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures."
"7","Leonard: I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights."
"7","Penny: I’m so glad you guys are friends again."
"7","Sheldon: And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too."
"7","Penny: Aw."
"7","Sheldon: Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it."
"7","Penny: Fifty cents off Vagisil."
"7","Sheldon: Think of me when you apply it."
"7","Raj: Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah."
"7","Penny: Me, too."
"7"," "
"7","Leonard: Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?"
"7","Bernadette: Oh, that happened right after you left."
"7","Leonard: And no one told me?"
"7","Howard (crying): Can’t believe we forgot to tell him."
"7","(crying)"
"7","Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon): Think of Sheldon when you apply it."

"7","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory"
"7","Raj: So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party."
"7","Leonard: Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that."
"7","Raj: No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing."
"7","Amy: We’re sorry, Rajesh."
"7","Bernadette: Maybe we can do it next week."
"7","Howard: Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry."
"7","Raj: Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties."
"7","Leonard: Great."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you."
"7","Howard: Hallelujah."
"7","Raj: Because I’ve got something even better planned."
"7","Leonard: Aw."
"7","Howard: Why?"
"7","Sheldon: Come on."
"7","Raj: Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T."
"7","Howard: Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there."
"7","Leonard: We did them at Princeton, too."
"7","Howard: Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college."
"7","Sheldon: That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too."
"7","Amy: Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny."
"7","Penny: I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time."
"7","Leonard: Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…"
"7","Howard: And Princeton."
"7","Leonard: A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science."
"7","Penny: Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer."
"7","Raj: So, uh, who’s in?"
"7","Leonard: I think it sounds fun."
"7","Amy: Yeah, me, too."
"7","Various: I’m in, let’s do it."
"7","Sheldon: I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?"
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Leonard: What’s all this?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt."
"7","Leonard: You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams."
"7","Raj: Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? (Pumping disco music) Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p… (cough) each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins."
"7","(Pumping disco music) S"
"7","(cough) e"
"7","Sheldon: He is a born showman."
"7","Raj: Any questions?"
"7","Howard: Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?"
"7","Leonard: It’s not funny."
"7","Sheldon: No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school."
"7","Leonard: Ha-ha."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, see? Now he gets it."
"7","Raj: Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two."
"7","Bernadette: Should we just do couples?"
"7","Leonard: Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever."
"7","Penny: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me."
"7","Leonard: I just said, couples sound great."
"7","Penny: Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah."
"7","Leonard: All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to."
"7","Penny: No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!"
"7","Sheldon: Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?"
"7","Amy: Stop that. Penny is not a liability."
"7","Penny: Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?"
"7","Amy: Maybe we pick names out of a hat."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment. (Montage with scenes in the apartment and Leonard’s bedroom)"
"7","Penny: All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it."
"7","Sheldon: Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?"
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Sheldon: It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting."
"7","Raj (over walkie-talkie): All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me."
"7","(over walkie-talkie)"
"7","Sheldon: What are you doing? You have to start with the edges."
"7","Penny: Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time."
"7","Howard: Wow, you’re really good at puzzles."
"7","Amy: I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that."
"7","Howard: If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake."
"7","Amy: I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette."
"7","Howard: Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?"
"7","Amy: No."
"7","Howard: Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?"
"7","Bernadette: Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!"
"7","Leonard: Stop yelling at me."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you."
"7","Penny: Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go."
"7","Sheldon: But we haven’t finished the puzzle."
"7","Penny: But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on."
"7","Sheldon: You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?"
"7","Penny: Okay, it’s not gonna say that."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store."
"7","Howard: It’s the comic book store. Let’s go."
"7","Bernadette: Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store."
"7","Penny: It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store."
"7","Sheldon: It’s the comic book store."
"7","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"7","Leonard: Do you think Penny’s mad at me?"
"7","Bernadette: Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming."
"7","Leonard: No, because I didn’t want her on my team."
"7","Bernadette: I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world."
"7","Leonard: Geez, I never realized you were so competitive."
"7","Bernadette: Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?"
"7","Scene: Howard’s car."
"7","Amy: I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together."
"7","Howard: Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?"
"7","Amy: Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you."
"7","Howard: Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think."
"7","Amy: Such as?"
"7","Howard: I don’t know. Tell me some things you like."
"7","Amy: Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…"
"7","Howard: Hey, how about some music?"
"7","Amy: Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member."
"7","Howard: Find something you like."
"7","Amy: Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?"
"7","Howard: Yeah, I love Neil Diamond."
"7","Amy: I love Neil Diamond."
"7","Both: Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I’ve been inclined…"
"7","Scene: The comic book store."
"7","Raj: Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt."
"7","Stuart: Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of."
"7","Raj: Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive."
"7","Amy: Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it."
"7","Raj: Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?"
"7","Bernadette: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call."
"7","Leonard: I have asthma. Back off."
"7","Howard: Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see."
"7","Raj: Good riddle, huh?"
"7","Stuart: Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?"
"7","Raj: I invited you to my murder mystery party."
"7","Stuart: No, you didn’t."
"7","Raj: Oh."
"7","Penny: Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up."
"7","Sheldon: It is a marathon, not a sprint."
"7","Penny: People run in a marathon."
"7","Sheldon: Not with a bowling ball on their back."
"7","Leonard: Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time."
"7","Leonard: Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve."
"7","Penny: Riddle me this…"
"7","Sheldon: Got it."
"7","Penny: Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead."
"7","Sheldon: I thought we were the Lightning Sharks."
"7","Howard: Hey, you know what this could mean (whispers)."
"7","(whispers)."
"7","Amy: Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be (whispers back)"
"7","(whispers back)"
"7","Howard: That’s it."
"7","Amy: To the Neil Mobile."
"7","Bernadette: I knew it, we’re gonna lose."
"7","Leonard: Wait, I got it. I got it/"
"7","Bernadette: Congratulations, you got it last."
"7","Leonard: You’re really mean, you know that?"
"7","Stuart: So no one’s gonna buy anything."
"7","Scene: The geology lab at the University."
"7","Penny: Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh."
"7","Sheldon: The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks."
"7","Penny: Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?"
"7","Penny: Yes."
"7","Sheldon: Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab."
"7","Penny: Wow. I can drink a beer underwater."
"7","Sheldon: And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…"
"7","Penny: Shut up. I solved it."
"7","Sheldon: Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go."
"7","Penny: Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?"
"7","Sheldon: No one likes a know-it-all, Penny."
"7","Howard: On the boats and on the planes."
"7","Amy: They’re coming to America."
"7","Howard: Never looking back again."
"7","Amy: They’re coming to America… ♪"
"7","Leonard: Um, I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car."
"7","Bernadette: Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix things."
"7","Leonard: Uh-huh. Like death?"
"7","Bernadette (out of the window): Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron."
"7","(out of the window)"
"7","Leonard: Penny’s not answering my texts."
"7","Bernadette: Who cares? Focus on the game."
"7","Leonard: This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting."
"7","Bernadette: No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship."
"7","Leonard: Why?"
"7","Bernadette: Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are."
"7","Leonard: What does she think I am?"
"7","Bernadette: How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow."
"7","Leonard: I can’t believe she would say that about me."
"7","Bernadette: If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow."

"7","Leonard: Call me a lady part. We’ll see about that."
"7","Bernadette: Can you reach the clue?"
"7","Leonard: Almost."
"7","Bernadette: Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley."
"7","Leonard: Got it."
"7","Bernadette: Great, climb back up. Come on."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, Penny might be onto something."
"7","Sheldon: To the planetarium."
"7","Penny: Let’s go."
"7","Leonard: To the tar pits."
"7","Bernadette: Let’s go."
"7","Amy: There’s a Neil Diamond concert next month."
"7","Howard: Let’s go."
"7","Scene: The laundry room."
"7","Penny: Three bags, no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones here."
"7","Sheldon: It’s dirty laundry. You’re up."
"7","Penny: What? Why me?"
"7","Sheldon: Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry."
"7","Bernadette: They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy."
"7","Penny: Okay, the clue must be in the bag."
"7","Leonard: The clue must be in the bag."
"7","Penny: It’s just a bunch of pants."
"7","Leonard: It’s just a bunch of pants."
"7","Penny: You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team."
"7","Leonard: Well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon."
"7","Penny: What are you talking about?"
"7","Leonard: You know exactly what I’m talking about."
"7","Bernadette: No, she doesn’t. I just made that up."
"7","Leonard: Why would you do that?"
"7","Bernadette: Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears."
"7","Sheldon: I’m not a child. I know the word ninny."
"7","Penny: Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass."
"7","Bernadette: Wish I had a man like her on my team."
"7","Leonard: Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this."
"7","Sheldon: Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt."
"7","Penny: Oh."
"7","Sheldon: Hey, that’s my shirt."
"7","Leonard: This one is, too."
"7","Sheldon: No, no, that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it."
"7","Penny: But wait. So does this one."
"7","Bernadette: Maybe the spot’s the clue."
"7","Penny: Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, that’s clever."
"7","Penny (off): Hurry."
"7","(off)"
"7","Sheldon: Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these."
"7","Scene: The stairwell."
"7","Bernadette: Stop her, Leonard, stop her."
"7","Penny: Well, where the hell’s the coin?"
"7","Leonard: Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?"
"7","Raj: Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was."
"7","Bernadette: Then where’s the coin?"
"7","Raj: Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today."
"7","Penny: I don’t get it."
"7","Raj: Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner."
"7","Leonard: Are you kidding me?"
"7","Penny: That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard."
"7","Bernadette: You suck so hard."
"7","Raj: Well, I thought… Come on, I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny."
"7","Penny: Run."
"7","Raj: Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time."
"7","Penny: Run to India."
"7","Raj: I just wanted to do something beautiful."
"7","Sheldon (entering): Hey, look. I won."
"7","(entering)"
"7","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night."
"7","Howard: Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,"
"7","Amy: She got the way to groove me."
"7","Howard: Cherry, baby"
"7","Amy: She got the way to move me, honey."
"7","Together: She got the way to groove me. She got the way to move me."
"7","Howard: Cherry"
"7","Together: She got the way to groove me, yeah!"
"7","Series 07 Episode 04 – The Raiders Minimization"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Sheldon: So what’d you think?"
"7","Amy: It was good."
"7","Sheldon: That’s it? Good”"
"7","Amy: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time."
"7","Sheldon: My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites."
"7","Amy: It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem."
"7","Sheldon: Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it."
"7","Amy: All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip."
"7","Amy: No, I do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The foyer."
"7","Leonard: Hey."
"7","Penny: Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?"
"7","Penny: Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter."
"7","Leonard: You bought my mom’s book?"
"7","Penny: Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class."
"7","Leonard: Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it."
"7","Penny: Oh, cool. Are there pictures?"
"7","Leonard: Seriously, please find another book."
"7","Penny: Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?"
"7","Leonard: There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it."
"7","Penny: Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?"
"7","Leonard: It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God, you still go left."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Raj: Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?"
"7","Howard: Halle Berry. Why?"
"7","Raj: Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure."
"7","Leonard: Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?"
"7","Sheldon: I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that."
"7","Howard: Because her life wasn’t enough?"
"7","Raj: Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die."
"7","All: Aw!"
"7","Howard: Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first."
"7","Leonard: Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny: Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?"
"7","Leonard: No."
"7","Penny: I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies."
"7","Leonard: They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk."
"7","Penny: You were wearing her bra."
"7","Leonard: That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?"
"7","Penny: Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things."
"7","Leonard: Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house."
"7","Penny: Well, why were you so angry?"
"7","Leonard: Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June."
"7","Penny: Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better."
"7","Leonard: I do, too, but there’s not."
"7","Penny: Really? Are you sure about that?"
"7","Leonard: Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it."
"7","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"7","Stuart: Is make-up really necessary?"
"7","Raj: Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."
"7","Stuart: You got it."
"7","Raj: Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you."
"7","Stuart: I don’t think I can give you that."
"7","Raj: Come on. One more time. Yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?"
"7","Stuart: Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?"
"7","Raj: Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?"
"7","Stuart: I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?"
"7","Raj: My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?"
"7","Stuart: I put: not applicable."
"7","Raj: Come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on."
"7","Stuart: Really? Like what?"
"7","Raj: Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business."
"7","Stuart: Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman."
"7","Raj: Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?"
"7","Stuart: I do have one oddly long testicle."
"7","Raj: Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!"
"7","Leonard: Whatcha doin’?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works."
"7","Leonard: So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?"
"7","Sheldon: Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke."
"7","Leonard: Mm-hmm. And?"
"7","Sheldon: And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?"
"7","Leonard: Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be."
"7","Sheldon: Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes."
"7","Leonard: Sorry, buddy."
"7","Sheldon: Ooh, I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I."
"7","Leonard: I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny."
"7","Sheldon: Wait, hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?"
"7","Leonard: I gotta go."
"7","Leonard: You ready to go?"
"7","Penny: Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys."
"7","Leonard: Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?"
"7","Penny: Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…"
"7","Leonard: Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go."
"7","Penny: Hey, what’s going on with you?"
"7","Leonard: Nothing, I’m fine."
"7","Penny: All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?"
"7","Leonard: No. Not everything is about my mom."
"7","Penny: ‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go."
"7","Leonard: Except this is totally about my mom."
"7","Penny: I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?"
"7","Leonard: That sounds nice. Yeah."
"7","Penny: Okay."
"7","Leonard: Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom."
"7","Scene: Leonard’s lab."
"7","Howard: Leonard, you ready for lunch?"
"7","Leonard: One sec. Hey. Sorry."
"7","Howard: Hi, Penny."
"7","Penny: Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today."
"7","Leonard: I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight."
"7","Howard: Wow. Sex at work?"
"7","Leonard: Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend."
"7","Howard: Sorry."
"7","Leonard: Who just had sex with me at work."
"7","Howard: Damn. How’d you swing that?"
"7","Leonard: Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better."
"7","Howard: Seriously?"
"7","Leonard: Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end."
"7","Howard: You sound kind of proud of it."
"7","Leonard: I am, I’m really proud."
"7","Amy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?"
"7","(on webcam)"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. Why?"
"7","Amy: Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey."
"7","Sheldon: April 13, a dark night, indeed."
"7","Amy: So what can I do for you?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening."
"7","Amy: Really?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie."
"7","Amy: That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?"
"7","Sheldon: Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?"
"7","Amy: Of course I’m in."
"7","Sheldon: Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler."
"7","Amy: Good night, Dr. Cooper."
"7","Sheldon: Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?"
"7","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"7","Bernadette: You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?"
"7","Howard: Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was."
"7","Bernadette: Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes."
"7","Howard: How about I take a bath with you and see what happens."
"7","Bernadette: Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes."
"7","Howard: That’s it? No compassion?"
"7","Bernadette: Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath."
"7","Howard: Bernie…"
"7","Bernadette: God, what is going on with you?"
"7","Howard: I’m sharing my pain."
"7","Bernadette: And I’m not buying it. Try again."
"7","Howard: I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?"
"7","Bermadette: Strike two."
"7","Howard: I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python."
"7","Bernadette: Howard."
"7","Howard: I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes."
"7","Raj: Three, two, one."
"7","Stuart: That’s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet."
"7","Raj: Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!"
"7","Stuart: That’s right, ladies. For all you know, I’m confident and fun to be around."
"7","Raj: Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight."
"7","Stuart: If it is, I’ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I’d started this years ago, I’d be divorced two or three times by now."
"7","Raj: What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?"
"7","Stuart: Well, they’re not running away screaming, so, no."
"7","Amy: I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner."
"7","Amy: You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark."
"7","Sheldon: That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge."
"7","Sheldon: Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco."
"7","Amy: Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it."
"7","Sheldon: Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it."
"7","Amy: I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you."
"7","Amy: Do you feel better?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job."
"7","Leonard: Hey, I was just… what is happening?"
"7","Penny: Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."
"7","Leonard: Oh, oh, I have. So bad."
"7","Penny: And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you."
"7","Leonard: Uh-huh, I can already feel it working."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard."
"7","Leonard: Mom?"
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend."
"7","Leonard: I… uh…"
"7","Penny: Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: Let’s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life."
"7","Leonard: Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle."
"7","Leonard: I didn’t dream that?"
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: How did that make you feel?"
"7","Leonard: Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now."
"7","Raj: In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?"
"7","Stuart: Combined?"
"7","Raj: Yes."
"7","Stuart: Zero."
"7","Raj: Dude, this is, this is brutal."
"7","Stuart: I don’t think I’ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound."
"7","Raj: This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school."
"7","Stuart: And make them look us in the eye."
"7","Raj: Yeah, anything is better than this."
"7","Scene: A bar."
"7","Raj: Hello."
"7","Girl: Not interested."
"7","Raj: I was wrong. This is worse."
"7","Howard: Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse."
"7","Sheldon: That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing."
"7","Raj: Like a hero."
"7","All: Yeah!"
"7","Leonard: Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done."
"7","Series 07 Episode 05 – The Workplace Proximity"
"7","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory"
"7","Penny: Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night."
"7","Amy: It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon."
"7","Penny: How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?"
"7","Sheldon: If you do that, I’ll scream."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you."
"7","Sheldon: That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one."
"7","Amy: I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool."
"7","Sheldon: You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win."
"7","Amy: So, you’re okay with this?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, why wouldn’t I be?"
"7","Amy: Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats."
"7","Sheldon: My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?"
"7","Amy: Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace."
"7","Sheldon: Really?"
"7","Amy: Yes."
"7","Sheldon: Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm."
"7","Amy: I’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together."
"7","Sheldon: Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world, little lady."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Howard: Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam."
"7","Sheldon: Why not? Hairy Fairy."
"7","Raj: I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work."
"7","Leonard: Your father’s a gynaecologist."
"7","Raj: I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops."
"7","Howard: Would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?"
"7","Leonard: No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby."
"7","Sheldon: That’s a Raging Ogre."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, I know."
"7","Howard: I’m just saying, I’d never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?"
"7","Raj: Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together."
"7","Howard: Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota."
"7","Leonard: Please let me be there when you tell her that."
"7","Sheldon: Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?"
"7","Leonard: Please, oh, please, just let me be there."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Bernadette: So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?"
"7","Amy: I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys."
"7","Bernadette: If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes."
"7","Amy: Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?"
"7","Bernadette: You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical."
"7","Penny: You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys."
"7","Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny."
"7","(off)"
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Bernadette: He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?"
"7","Amy: I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday."
"7","Sheldon: Hi. Um, I’ve reconsidered. Uh, you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening."
"7","Amy: Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque."
"7","Sheldon: Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good."
"7","Penny: Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other."
"7","Bernadette: He said what?"
"7","Sheldon: Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious."
"7","Bernadette: Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?"
"7","Amy: No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project."
"7","Penny: Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do."
"7","Sheldon: Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public."
"7","Penny: That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. I’ll be in a different building. And we don’t even have to have lunch together."
"7","Amy: Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys."
"7","Sheldon: Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?"
"7","Amy: More and more sure."
"7","Sheldon: Well, then, you have my permission."
"7","Amy: I didn’t ask for your permission."
"7","Sheldon: Too late. No backsies."
"7","Howard: No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around."
"7","Sheldon: Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway."
"7","Bernadette: Well?"
"7","Howard: Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it’s true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you."
"7","Howard: For the love of God, why?"
"7","Bernadette: What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?"
"7","Raj: His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one."
"7","Howard: It’s nothing in particular. I…"
"7","Bernadette: Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?"
"7","Howard: My arm is feeling numb."
"7","Leonard: Nailed it."
"7","Bernadette: That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus."
"7","Howard: My point is, I’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long."
"7","Bernadette: Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?"
"7","Howard: Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?"
"7","Bernadette: Find somewhere else to sleep tonight."
"7","Howard: Bernie…"
"7","Sheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Leonard: So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?"
"7","Raj: It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride."
"7","Howard: Please, stop talking."
"7","Raj: As you wish."
"7","Howard: I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t tried to help you."
"7","Sheldon: Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn."
"7","Amy: Gentlemen."
"7","Raj: Amy."
"7","Leonard: Hey."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Leonard: That was kind of icy. You two okay?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, we’re fine. As Howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries."
"7","Leonard: Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry, little moth. The flame will come to you."
"7","Raj: Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?"
"7","Howard: I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy."
"7","Raj: That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips."
"7","Amy: And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm."
"7","Sheldon: Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?"
"7","Amy: Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, please, I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool."
"7","Amy: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: It’s a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?"
"7","Scene: Amy’s lab."
"7","Amy: Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking."
"7","Sheldon: Dr. Fowler?"
"7","Amy: What do you want, Sheldon?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, I’m done with work, so… ugh!"
"7","Amy: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?"
"7","Amy: Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli."
"7","Sheldon: So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night."
"7","Amy: I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor."
"7","Sheldon: What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour."
"7","Amy: You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup."
"7","Sheldon: Aw. Embarrassed you?"
"7","Amy: You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home."
"7","Sheldon: I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me."
"7","Amy: Really? What tipped you off?"
"7","Sheldon: Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…"
"7","Amy: Get out."
"7","Sheldon: Well, now, that."
"7","Amy: Image number six, woman giving birth."
"7","Sheldon: Bleugh!"
"7","Leonard: It’s nine o’clock, where you been?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop."
"7","Penny: Oh, no."
"7","Sheldon: Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?"
"7","Leonard: I did not."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk."
"7","Penny: Why’d you get that? You hate lamb."
"7","Sheldon: I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem."
"7","Leonard: I thought Amy was gonna drive you home."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, I thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice."
"7","Penny: Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?"
"7","Penny: Yeah."
"7","Sheldon: But you didn’t even hear the details."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong."
"7","Sheldon: But you don’t even know…"
"7","Leonard: Doesn’t matter."
"7","Sheldon: But, now, but in my defence…"
"7","Sheldon: You’re not listening to my side of it."
"7","Penny: Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?"
"7","Sheldon: Well…"
"7","Penny: Nope, got to go with Amy on this one."
"7","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"7","Howard: Ooh, shrimp was spicy."
"7","Raj: You want a TUMS?"
"7","Howard: You got the tropical fruit kind?"
"7","Raj: No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy."
"7","Howard: Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk. (Knock on door) I’ll get it."
"7","(Knock on door)"
"7","Raj: Thanks."
"7","Bernadette: Hi."
"7","Howard: Oh, hi."
"7","Bernadette: I may have overreacted."
"7","Howard: Yeah, well, I didn’t handle it so great, either."
"7","Bernadette: It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me."
"7","Howard: That’s not true."
"7","Bernadette: It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings."
"7","Howard: Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I’m so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority."
"7","Bernadette: Why tomorrow?"
"7","Howard: Well, we’re real close to finishing off the new Batman game."
"7","Raj: It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her."
"7","Howard: Should I go after you?"
"7","Bernadette (off): No!"
"7","Howard: Thanks for getting me in trouble."
"7","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"7","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?"
"7","Sheldon: I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?"
"7","Amy: No."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I cannot give this stuff away."
"7","Amy: What do you want?"
"7","Sheldon: Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, you’re not a weirdo."
"7","Sheldon: I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour."
"7","Amy: What’s your point?"
"7","Sheldon: My point is, we’re a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all."
"7","Amy: I like you, too."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it."
"7","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar."
"7","Bernadette: I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him."
"7","Penny: All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight."
"7","Leonard: Laser’s warmed up."
"7","Howard: Pull."
"7","All: Yeah!"

"7","Penny: What are you working on?"
"7","Sheldon: Can’t talk. In the zone."
"7","Penny: Do you know what he’s doing?"
"7","Amy: Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut."
"7","Penny: Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s ready."
"7","Leonard: No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time."
"7","Howard: Sorry we’re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work."
"7","Bernadette: Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans."
"7","Raj: Why is that great news?"
"7","Bernadette: In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money."
"7","Howard: Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead already."
"7","Howard: Guys, listen up."
"7","Sheldon: Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care."
"7","Howard: Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette."
"7","Sheldon: Really don’t care."
"7","Howard: I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it."
"7","Penny: Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"
"7","Howard: Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next."
"7","Penny: Ah."
"7","Howard: Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together."
"7","Leonard: Aw."
"7","Amy: Oh, I love that."
"7","Raj: That is so beautiful."
"7","Howard: Sheldon?"
"7","Sheldon: When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?"
"7","Credits sequence"
"7","Scene: The stairwell"
"7","Leonard: It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette."
"7","Penny: Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?"
"7","Leonard: Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?"
"7","Sheldon: Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone."
"7","Leonard: And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?"
"7","Penny: I can name tons."
"7","Leonard: Sex doesn’t count."
"7","Penny: Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?"
"7","Leonard: Well, I took you there. All you did was…"
"7","Penny: I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to."
"7","Leonard: It’s fine. And also not true."
"7","Penny: Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off."
"7","Leonard: That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?"
"7","Penny: Sheldon?"
"7","Sheldon: Zone."
"7","Leonard: He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something."
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
"7","Leonard: Nope, it was better before."
"7","Sheldon: Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
"7","Leonard: Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?"
"7","Sheldon: Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…"
"7","Leonard: Yeah, definitely better before."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Howard: So I’m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?"
"7","Leonard: If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello."
"7","Howard: Great. Will you play the ukulele?"
"7","Raj: Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax."
"7","Howard: Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar."
"7","Raj: Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face."
"7","Sheldon: Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks."
"7","Howard: Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon."
"7","Raj: Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, that’s incredible."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line."
"7","Howard: So, what happens next?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been."
"7","Leonard: Good to know."
"7","Sheldon: Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny: Thank you so much for coming."
"7","Raj: You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard."
"7","Penny: Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this."
"7","Raj: As I’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…"
"7","Penny: Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count."
"7","Raj: Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach."
"7","Penny: I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?"
"7","Raj: Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition."
"7","Penny: Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head."
"7","Raj: Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."
"7","Penny: That’s from Say Anything."
"7","Raj: Look, I’m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you."
"7","Penny: I get that, but why is this so hard?"
"7","Raj: Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you."
"7","Penny: Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t."
"7","Sheldon: Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery."
"7","Amy: I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker."
"7","Sheldon: And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, I’m so proud of you."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
"7","Amy: What’s next?"
"7","Sheldon: This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…"
"7","Amy: And what?"
"7","Sheldon: No. No, no, no, no."
"7","Amy: What’s wrong?"
"7","Sheldon: I’ve made a horrible mistake."
"7","Amy: What are you talking about?"
"7","Sheldon: This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?"
"7","Amy: That Americans can’t handle the metric system?"
"7","Sheldon: Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000."
"7","Amy: But the Chinese team found the element."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about."
"7","Amy: So you just got lucky?"
"7","Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky."
"7","Amy: You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking."
"7","Sheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud."
"7","Amy: You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist."
"7","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"7","Leonard:: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake."
"7","Sheldon: There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve."
"7","Leonard: Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you."
"7","Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing."
"7","Leonard: Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape."
"7","Sheldon: You know, frankly, I’d prefer a sex tape."
"7","Leonard: You don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?"
"7","Sheldon: No."
"7","Howard: Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want to blow the surprise."
"7","Leonard: We’ll be there."
"7","Raj: Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap."
"7","Howard: E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No."
"7","Raj: Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat."
"7","Leonard: I will not."
"7","Raj: Oh, please?"
"7","Howard: No, I want this to be romantic."
"7","Raj: It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I’m referring to you."
"7","Voice: There he is. (General applause)"
"7","(General applause)"
"7","Sheldon: Stop it. Stop celebrating me."
"7","Voice: Woo!"
"7","Sheldon: And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future."
"7","Raj: Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?"
"7","(More applause)"
"7","Leonard: Invite them to live with us."
"7","Scene: A restaurant."
"7","Penny: Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this."
"7","Leonard: Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic."
"7","Penny: Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face."
"7","Leonard: Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count."
"7","Howard: I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call and check on her."
"7","Sheldon: The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant."
"7","Raj: Oh, that’s a big deal."
"7","Sheldon: I know. When will this nightmare end?"
"7","Leonard: Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you."
"7","Amy: I’m not."
"7","Sheldon: You’re not?"
"7","Amy: Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you."
"7","Sheldon: That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard."
"7","Penny: Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me."
"7","Sheldon: Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort."
"7","Howard: Guys, there was an accident at Bernie’s lab."
"7","Leonard: Oh, my God, is she okay?"
"7","Howard: Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine."
"7","Penny: What?"
"7","Amy: Poor Bernadette."
"7","Leonard: Oh, no."
"7","Sheldon: I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise."
"7","Scene: The hospital."
"7","Howard: Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?"
"7","Bernadette: Well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips."
"7","Howard: You’re sure you’re okay?"
"7","Bernadette: Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date."
"7","Howard: Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in."
"7","Bernadette: What’s all this?"
"7","Howard: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you."
"7","Bernadette: Howie."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, get over here."
"7","Sheldon: She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?"
"7","Amy: Sheldon."
"7","Howard (singing): If I didn’t have you, life would be blue, I’d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS."
"7","(singing)"
"7","Sheldon: Is it me, or does she not look so good?"
"7","Amy: Shh."
"7","Howard: A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom."
"7","All: And he’d probably still live with his mom."
"7","Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, Howie."
"7","Howard: If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam."
"7","All: And he’d definitely still live with his mom."
"7","Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette."
"7","All: Oh, we couldn’t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette."
"7","Bernadette: Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking."
"7","Sheldon: She’s sick, I knew it. Bye."
"7","Leonard: I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever made."
"7","Penny: I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way."
"7","Leonard: Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident."
"7","Penny: Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why."
"7","Leonard: Oh, rose petals."
"7","Penny: Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers."
"7","Leonard: You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops."
"7","Penny: Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you."
"7","Leonard: Oh, wow."
"7","Penny: It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up."
"7","Leonard: This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much."
"7","Leonard: Nothing. I love it."
"7","Penny: No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition."
"7","Leonard: It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God, I am the worst."
"7","Leonard: No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful."
"7","Penny: No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it."
"7","Leonard: I can’t believe you saved all this stuff."
"7","Penny: Of course I did. It’s you."
"7","Leonard: Come here."
"7","Penny: Oh."
"7","Leonard: Is that a pregnancy test?"
"7","Penny: Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all."
"7","Sheldon: I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you."
"7","Amy: Me? What did I do?"
"7","Sheldon: You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you."
"7","Amy: Sorry."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do."
"7","Amy: Oh, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon (not in Amy’s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?"
"7","(not in Amy’s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory)"

"7","Sheldon: Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash."
"7","Leonard: Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail."

"7","Leonard: He thinks there’s a difference."
"7","Sheldon: Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age."
"7","Arthur: Trust me, I, I remember."
"7","Sheldon: This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children."
"7","Arthur: Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?"
"7","Amy: Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity."
"7","Arthur: Oh, okay, I get it now."
"7","Leonard: Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter."
"7","Arthur: Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?"
"7","Leonard: No, she’s not."
"7","Sheldon: So, what prescription are you getting filled?"
"7","Leonard: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me."
"7","Arthur: I wasn’t going to tell you."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, come on."
"7","Sheldon: No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"
"7","Arthur: Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess."
"7","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that."
"7","Sheldon: But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","The cafeteria."
"7","Howard: Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?"
"7","Raj: Actually, I’m busy."
"7","Howard: Doing what?"
"7","Raj: There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…"
"7","Howard: You’re going to girls’ night."
"7","Raj: Yeah."
"7","Howard: You know they’re making jewellery right?"
"7","Raj: You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts."
"7","Leonard: What’s up?"
"7","Howard: Not his testosterone levels."
"7","Raj: Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity."
"7","Howard: How is that possible?"
"7","Leonard: Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton."
"7","Sheldon: Goody. What’s it say?"
"7","Leonard: He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it."
"7","Sheldon: That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me."
"7","Howard: You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades."
"7","Raj: Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about."
"7","Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not cry."
"7","Howard: It’s true, you’d rust."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Sheldon: And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony."
"7","Amy: Is it really worth getting upset about?"
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
"7","Amy: Come on, he’s a retired kids show host."
"7","Sheldon: That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert."
"7","Amy: Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills."
"7","Amy: Maybe he found you, um, a bit much."
"7","Sheldon: That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it."
"7","Amy: From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…"
"7","Sheldon: What?"
"7","Amy: Doesn’t matter."
"7","Sheldon: No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying."
"7","Amy: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right."
"7","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"7","Amy: This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to."
"7","Raj: Penny, how’s it going over there?"
"7","Penny: Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue."
"7","Amy: How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?"
"7","Penny: Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader."
"7","Howard: Hello, everyone."
"7","Raj: Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes."
"7","Howard: Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed."
"7","Raj: Thank you."
"7","Howard: So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un."
"7","Bernadette: Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making."
"7","Howard: Oh, that’s actually pretty nice."
"7","Amy: I’m making a bracelet."
"7","Penny: Yeah, I’m just making a mess."
"7","Howard: You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff."
"7","Raj: Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you."
"7","Amy: Actually, I’d kind of like to try that."
"7","Bernadette: Me, too."
"7","Howard: Be right back."
"7","Penny: When did I have pistachios?"
"7","Scene: Professor Proton’s house."
"7","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money."
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Arthur: Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m sorry, did I wake you?"
"7","Arthur: Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars."
"7","Arthur: What do you want, Sheldon?"
"7","Sheldon: It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you."
"7","Arthur: She sounds like a keeper."
"7","Sheldon: Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry."
"7","Arthur: All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night."
"7","Sheldon: No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you."
"7","Arthur: Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house."
"7","Sheldon: Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead."
"7","Arthur: I should be so lucky."
"7","Sheldon: So, uh, what do you say?"
"7","Arthur: You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard."
"7","Sheldon: It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying."
"7","Arthur: Good night."
"7","Sheldon: Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it."
"7","Arthur: You’re annoying."
"7","Sheldon: Well, that really hurt."
"7","Scene: Leonard’s laboratory."
"7","Leonard: If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you."
"7","Arthur: If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking."
"7","Leonard: I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting."
"7","Sheldon: Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here."
"7","Leonard: Why is it odd?"
"7","Sheldon: Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model."
"7","Bill Nye: Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours."
"7","Arthur: That’s what I told my lawyers."
"7","Leonard: Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense."
"7","Bill: He said I’d be speaking to a class."
"7","Sheldon: No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go."
"7","Bill: What are you guys working on?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes."
"7","Bill: Oh, that’s interesting."
"7","Arthur: Haven’t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny: Hey, guys, what do you think?"
"7","Amy: Wow, Penny, good job."
"7","Penny: Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink."
"7","Amy: What are you working on?"
"7","Raj: Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom."
"7","Amy: That’s sweet."
"7","Raj: Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her."
"7","Penny: What’s going on with them?"
"7","Raj: They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again."
"7","Bernadette: Hi."
"7","Penny: Hey, guys."
"7","Amy: Hello."
"7","Howard: Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it."
"7","Howard: Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use."
"7","Raj: I didn’t know you were coming again."
"7","Howard: Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here."
"7","Penny (laughing): It was not funny."
"7","(laughing)"
"7","Amy: So, what tools did you bring?"
"7","Howard: Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down."
"7","Penny: Ooh, that looks like fun."
"7","Bernadette: Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire."
"7","Howard: Okay, who’s up first?"
"7","Amy: Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?"
"7","Raj: No, thanks."
"7","Howard: I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet."
"7","Leonard: Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes."
"7","Arthur: This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again."
"7","Leonard: Oh, God."
"7","Arthur: What, what is it?"
"7","Leonard: Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies."
"7","Arthur: Can, can I ask you a question?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah, sure."
"7","Arthur: Why do you put up with Sheldon?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends."
"7","Arthur: Why?"
"7","Leonard: Wow, you ask really hard questions."
"7","Arthur: Yeah."
"7","Leonard: Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together."
"7","Arthur: You, you know you’re describing a dog."
"7","Leonard: He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…"
"7","Arthur: Yeah, they, they hate that."
"7","Leonard: You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too."
"7","Arthur: Why, why is that?"
"7","Leonard: Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez."
"7","Arthur: Another photo from Sheldon?"
"7","Leonard: No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place."
"7","Arthur: He probably stole his wallet, too."
"7","Howard: You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it."
"7","Penny: Oh, that’s amazing,"
"7","Howard: Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back."
"7","Bernadette: He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger."
"7","Raj: My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me."
"7","Howard: Whoa, where is that coming from?"
"7","Raj: I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone."
"7","Penny: Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds."
"7","Howard: How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery."
"7","Raj: But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings."
"7","Howard: Since when can’t you open up with me?"
"7","Raj: There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch."
"7","Howard: Buddy, I was just joking around."
"7","Raj: Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt."
"7","Howard: You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me."
"7","Raj: Thank you. It wasn’t easy."
"7","Amy: They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it."
"7","Sheldon: Arthur?"
"7","Arthur: Hi, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: I’m surprised to see you here."
"7","Arthur: Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light."
"7","Sheldon: I’ll get Leonard."
"7","Arthur: No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you."
"7","Sheldon: If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy."
"7","Arthur: No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you. It would be an honour."
"7","Arthur: Oh. Uh, great."
"7","Sheldon: Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it."
"7","Arthur: And, what did you think?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing."
"7","Arthur: Mmm. Thank you."
"7","Sheldon: Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired."
"7","Arthur: Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me."
"7","Sheldon: Can I invite you in for tea?"
"7","Arthur: Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run."
"7","Penny: Hey, Arthur. How are you?"
"7","Arthur: Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt."
"7","Howard: Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?"
"7","Raj: Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something."
"7","Howard: You didn’t have to do that."
"7","Raj: Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle."
"7","Howard: Wow, this is so cool. Thanks."
"7","Raj: Oh gets better."
"7","Howard: Wow."
"7","Raj: And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?"
"7","Leonard: He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it."
"7","Arthur: So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?"
"7","Penny: Sorry, they’re both married."
"7","Arthur: Good."
"7","Penny: Mmm."
"7","Arthur: Hap, hap, happily?"
"7","Series 07 Episode 08 – The Itchy Brain Simulation"
"7","Scene: The apartment"
"7","Penny: Hey, can I ask you a question?"
"7","Leonard: Sure."
"7","Penny: You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but I’ve never seen you play."
"7","Leonard: Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window."
"7","Penny: What window?"
"7","Leonard: That one over there."
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?"
"7","Leonard: Skee-Ball tickets?"
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up."
"7","Leonard: Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box."
"7","Penny: Ooh, what are you gonna get?"
"7","Sheldon: None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it."
"7","Leonard: Yup, oh, here you go."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles."
"7","Leonard: Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college."
"7","Penny: Aw, did she hate you?"
"7","Leonard: Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite."
"7","Sheldon: I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?"
"7","Leonard: Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you barely looked. Let me see."
"7","Leonard: No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets."
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, let me look in the box."
"7","Leonard: Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out."
"7","Sheldon: Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider."
"7","Penny: No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out."
"7","Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?"
"7","Sheldon: That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?"
"7","Leonard: I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it."
"7","Sheldon: Okay."
"7","Leonard: I mean it, I’m going to."
"7","Sheldon: I believe you."
"7","Leonard: And you’re going to stay calm?"
"7","Sheldon: I said I would."
"7","Leonard: How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable."
"7","Penny: Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Leonard: So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet."
"7","Sheldon: Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch."
"7","Leonard: When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?"
"7","Sheldon: You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel."
"7","Leonard: Well, I don’t know how to do that."
"7","Sheldon: How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it."
"7","Leonard: That’s stupid. Why?"
"7","Sheldon: You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way."
"7","Leonard: I’m telling you, try the hanger."
"7","Sheldon: Put it on. Let’s share the experience."
"7","Leonard: You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago."
"7","Leonard: Really?"
"7","Sheldon: How those nipples feeling, chief?"
"7","Scene: The cheesecake factory bar."
"7","Bernadette: Penny, can we please get our drinks?"
"7","Penny: Yeah, hang on, just give me sec."
"7","Amy: At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery."
"7","Bernadette: Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections."
"7","Penny: I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there."
"7","Amy: Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart."
"7","Bernadette: That’s Lucy?"
"7","Penny: I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian."
"7","Bernadette: I think that reason’s called racism."
"7","Penny: I’m gonna go talk to her."
"7","Bernadette: Why? What are you gonna say?"
"7","Penny: I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?"
"7","Bernadette: You because you just called him your Indian friend."
"7","Penny: Yeah, well, you’re short."
"7","Amy: We’re never getting our drinks."
"7","Bernadette: No, but we knew that."
"7","Penny: Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?"
"7","Lucy: Oh, water would be great."
"7","Penny: Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you."
"7","Lucy: Wow. How’s he doing?"
"7","Penny: Oh, you know, he’s good."
"7","Lucy: Great."
"7","Penny: Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?"
"7","Lucy: Oh, I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be easier."
"7","Penny: Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him."
"7","Lucy: Any chance I can get a different waitress?"
"7","Penny: I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?"
"7","Lucy: I don’t know your e-mail."
"7","Penny: You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess."
"7","Lucy: Oh, I thought you said he was okay."
"7","Penny: Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?"
"7","Howard: So, you can never take it off?"
"7","Leonard: No."
"7","Raj: Not even to sleep?"
"7","Howard: So, you’re just an idiot?"
"7","Leonard: It’s called proving a point."
"7","Howard: Is the point that you’re an idiot?"
"7","Sheldon: Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler."
"7","Raj: So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?"
"7","Leonard: Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!"
"7","Howard: And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires."
"7","Raj: I don’t get it."
"7","Howard: You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?"
"7","Raj: No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras."
"7","Howard: You had to be taught not to play with cobras?"
"7","Raj: You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?"
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny: Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?"
"7","Bernadette: We did, you never brought it."
"7","Penny: Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club."
"7","Amy: Not even close."
"7","Penny: Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon."
"7","Amy: You want to say sorry."
"7","Bernadette: So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?"
"7","Penny: What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?"
"7","Amy: You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess."
"7","Bernadette: Then you made her cry and leave."
"7","Penny: Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back."
"7","Scene: The same, later."
"7","Raj: What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. (Phone text sound) It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny."
"7","(Phone text sound)"
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"7","Howard: Hey, what’re you working on?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy."
"7","Howard: That’s a pretty cool idea."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion."
"7","Howard: Sure."
"7","Sheldon: This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?"
"7","Leonard: Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me."
"7","Howard: You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin."
"7","Leonard: Or it’s resolved."
"7","Sheldon: Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good."
"7","Howard: I believe this is yours."
"7","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"7","Raj: Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?"
"7","Howard: You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence."
"7","Raj: Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?"
"7","Bernadette: If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?"
"7","Howard: Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride."
"7","Raj: He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything."
"7","Bernadette: Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens."
"7","Raj: Well, can I say she looks nice?"
"7","Bernadette: Sure."
"7","Raj: Can I tell her I miss her?"
"7","Bernadette: Maybe, if she asks."
"7","Raj: Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?"
"7","Bernadette: I’d save that for the second date."
"7","Raj: Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike."
"7","Penny: What are you doing?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me."
"7","Penny: Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?"
"7","Leonard: There’s a principle at stake."
"7","Penny: Which is?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell."
"7","Leonard: No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins."
"7","Penny: Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins."
"7","Leonard: No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft."
"7","Penny: Smile."
"7","Leonard: What is that? What is that for?"
"7","Penny: So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back."
"7","Amy: I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel."
"7","Amy: Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?"
"7","Sheldon: The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?"
"7","Amy: I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?"
"7","Sheldon: There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers."
"7","Amy: Seriously?"
"7","Sheldon: Please. Ha-ha, Oh."
"7","Scene: A coffee shop."
"7","Lucy: Hi."
"7","Raj: Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you."
"7","Lucy: You, too."
"7","Raj: Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?"
"7","Lucy: I’m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail."
"7","Raj: Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes."
"7","Lucy: Okay."
"7","Raj: I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever."
"7","Lucy: Oh, uh, I’m kind of seeing someone."
"7","Raj: I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?"
"7","Raj: This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?"
"7","Penny: There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with."
"7","Raj: I love you, Penny."
"7","Sheldon: How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?"
"7","Amy: I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?"
"7","Sheldon: There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can."
"7","Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon."
"7","Leonard: Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie."
"7","Sheldon: You know, it might be fun. You love hummus."
"7","Leonard: Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?"
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out."
"7","Leonard: What?"
"7","Sheldon: Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it."
"7","Sheldon: I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment."
"7","Leonard: Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!"
"7","Amy: Sheldon, that was diabolical."
"7","Sheldon: I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?"
"7","Raj: Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend."
"7","Girl: Well, I don’t."
"7","Raj: I don’t believe you, you’re lying to me."
"7","Girl: What?"
"7","Raj: Oh, it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side."
"7","Scene: The cheesecake factory."
"7","Girl (to Penny): What is wrong with you?"
"7","(to Penny)"
"7","Penny (to Raj): What is wrong with you?"
"7","(to Raj)"
"7","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"7","Raj (to a mirror): What is wrong with you?"
"7","(to a mirror)"
"7","Series 07 Episode 09 – The Thanksgiving Decoupling"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Leonard: The math is all there. It’s not real."
"7","Penny: Yes, it is."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it."
"7","Raj: It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred."
"7","Penny: Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers."
"7","Raj: Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious."
"7","Penny: Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side."
"7","Leonard: Were you drunk?"
"7","Penny: I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?"
"7","Leonard: I think you’re the one who fell over."
"7","Penny: That would explain why the sky was also on its side."
"7","Howard: Hey."
"7","Penny: Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?"
"7","Howard: Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house."
"7","Sheldon: Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful."
"7","Howard: Come on, it’ll be fun."
"7","Penny: Uh, we were actually gonna do it here."
"7","Howard: Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
"7","Leonard: It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day."
"7","Sheldon: Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?"
"7","Leonard: I want to go."
"7","Penny: Yeah, me, too."
"7","Raj: I’m in."
"7","Howard: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Sheldon: Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?"
"7","Amy: We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour."
"7","Sheldon: Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man."
"7","Amy: Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes."
"7","Penny: Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas."
"7","Leonard: You did?"
"7","Penny: Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club."
"7","Leonard: Wait, you went to a chapel?"
"7","Penny: Yeah."
"7","Leonard: Why?"
"7","Penny: We had one of those silly fake weddings."
"7","Leonard: Penny, you know those are real, right?"
"7","Penny: No, they’re not."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, they are."
"7","Sheldon: He’s right."
"7","Amy: They’re real."
"7","Penny: But it didn’t seem real."
"7","Sheldon: Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?"
"7","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"7","Bernadette: Hi, Dad."
"7","Mike: Hi, honey."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, you brought beer for everybody."
"7","Mike: Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game."
"7","Bernadette: You can have a quiet day and watch the game here."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, the medicine’s not working."
"7","(off)"
"7","Howard (off): You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. (entering) Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there."
"7","(entering)"
"7","Mike: Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?"
"7","Howard: Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): How can one little toe hurt so bad?"
"7","Howard: Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her."
"7","Bernadette: I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking."
"7","Howard: I have a better idea."
"7","Bernadette: If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy."
"7","Howard: I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, well, that’s a great idea."
"7","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"7","Amy: No traffic, we’re sailing."
"7","Sheldon: Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave."
"7","Sheldon: Yes, Miss Amy."
"7","Leonard: I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot."
"7","Penny: Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof."
"7","Leonard: Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of."
"7","Penny: I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head."
"7","Penny: So how do I undo this?"
"7","Leonard: I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened."
"7","Penny: Great, well, what do I have to do?"
"7","Amy: It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?"
"7","Sheldon: Hah!Penny? Next."
"7","Amy: Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?"
"7","Penny: Want of understanding? What does that even mean?"
"7","Amy: Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner."
"7","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s kitchen."
"7","Bernadette: Thanks for saving the day."
"7","Raj: Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?"
"7","Howard: Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek."
"7","Bernadette: I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?"
"7","Howard: He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter."
"7","Bernadette: Don’t be silly, he loves you."
"7","Howard: Does he?"
"7","Bernadette: Okay, he cares about you a lot."
"7","Howard: Really?"
"7","Scene: The living room."
"7","Bernadette: I do crap for you all the time. Get out there."
"7","Howard: So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?"
"7","Mike: Uh-huh."
"7","Howard: You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys."
"7","Amy: Happy Thanksgiving."
"7","Sheldon: It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…"
"7","Amy: Sheldon."
"7","Penny: Here. Thank you for having us."
"7","Howard: What’s with you?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack."
"7","Howard: Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical."
"7","Penny: I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car."
"7","Scene: The kitchen."
"7","Amy: You need any help?"
"7","Raj: Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?"
"7","Amy: Uh, sure."
"7","Raj: Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key."
"7","Amy: Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?"
"7","Together: What?"
"7","Howard: You ever play football?"
"7","Mike: A little in college. You?"
"7","Howard: No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered."
"7","Leonard: Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home."
"7","Penny: Fine."
"7","Leonard: And we can just put this whole thing behind us."
"7","Penny: Are you done?"
"7","Leonard: What?"
"7","Penny: Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?"
"7","Leonard: Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it."
"7","Penny: Ugh, I need some air."
"7","Leonard: Wuh, Penny."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her."
"7","Mike: Listen to Stretch."
"7","Leonard: How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim."
"7","Howard: Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife."
"7","Mike: I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?"
"7","Leonard: Sure."
"7","Mike: I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?"
"7","Sheldon: They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle."
"7","Mike: How the hell do you know that?"
"7","Sheldon: My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework."
"7","Penny: Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now."
"7","Leonard: Wait, you invited him here?"
"7","Mike: I’m getting ready to weigh in again."
"7","Leonard: Come on."
"7","Mike: What do you think they ought to do now?"
"7","Sheldon: I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz."
"7","Howard: Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say blintz?"
"7","Scene: The dining room."
"7","Leonard: I just don’t understand why you invited him here today."
"7","Penny: Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…"
"7","Raj: Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here."
"7","Penny: Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down."
"7","Raj: No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything."
"7","Leonard: Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack."
"7","Bernadette: What?"
"7","Amy: Ooh!"
"7","Raj: My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you."
"7","Howard: That’s why I sit."
"7","Mike: Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?"
"7","Sheldon: 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus."
"7","Mike: I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV."
"7","Sheldon: So was my dad. And then he did."
"7","Howard: Anyone need a beer?"
"7","Mike: Yeah."
"7","Howard: Thank God."
"7","Mike: So, does your dad still live in Texas?"
"7","Sheldon: No. He died when I was 14."
"7","Mike: I’m sorry to hear that."
"7","Sheldon: So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried."
"7","Howard: Here you go."
"7","Mike: Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man."
"7","Sheldon: No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no."
"7","Mike: Well, you’re having one with me."
"7","Sheldon: All right."
"7","Mike: To your dad."
"7","Howard: I never had a beer with my dad, either."
"7","Sheldon: Do you mind? We’re having a moment here."
"7","Amy: I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack."
"7","Raj: Wonder what she saw in that guy."
"7","Bernadette: I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome."
"7","Amy: Broad shoulders, good hair."
"7","Raj: Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard."
"7","Bernadette: How’s it going out there?"
"7","Howard: Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me."
"7","Amy: I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking."
"7","Bernadette: What are they doing?"
"7","Howard: They’re drinking beer and watching football."
"7","Bernadette: So why don’t you do that with them?"
"7","Howard: They don’t want me."
"7","Bernadette: What do you mean?"
"7","Howard: Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…"
"7","Amy: Zack’s here!"
"7","Raj: Stir the gravy."
"7","Bernadette: Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes."
"7","Leonard: Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday."
"7","Zack: It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family."
"7","Penny: Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over."
"7","Penny: Okay."
"7","Zack: I don’t know if I want to sign it."
"7","Raj, Bernadette and Amy: Ooh."
"7","Leonard: Why won’t you sign it?"
"7","Zack: I just think splitting up can be rough on kids."
"7","Penny: We don’t have any kids."
"7","Zack: Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning."
"7","Penny: Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator."
"7","Zack: Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis."
"7","Leonard: You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers."
"7","Penny: Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it."
"7","Leonard: That is not true."
"7","Penny: Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over."
"7","Leonard: You’re the one who invited him here."
"7","Penny: Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face."
"7","Zack: Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long."
"7","Zack: Oh, no. Are you dying?"
"7","Penny: I’m about to. Sign the paper."
"7","Zack: Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let’s eat."
"7","Sheldon (burping): Two, three, eight, four, six. (Normal) That’s all I can do without throwing up."
"7","(burping)"
"7","(Normal)"
"7","Mike: That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did somebody say pie?"
"7","Mike: I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there."
"7","Sheldon: All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time."
"7","Mike: Me, too."
"7","Bernadette: Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now."
"7","Sheldon: She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad."
"7","Amy: All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology."
"7","Sheldon: Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate."
"7","Bernadette: It’s okay."
"7","Howard: Don’t worry about it."
"7","Amy: Thank you."
"7","Sheldon: Ain’t she great?"
"7","Mike: Mmm."
"7","Sheldon: Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?"
"7","Bernadette: Thanks again for cooking."
"7","Amy: Yeah, everything was delicious."
"7","Raj: Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray."
"7","Mike: Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?"
"7","Sheldon: This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say pigskin?"
"7","Penny: Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money."
"7","Leonard: I’m sorry, too."
"7","Zack: Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around."
"7","Mike: I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world."
"7","Howard: Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me."
"7","Mike: Well, I’m drunk."
"7","Sheldon: I just vomited on a lot of clowns."
"7","Series 07 Episode 10 – The Discovery Dissipation"
"7","Scene: A radio studio."
"7","Ira Flatow: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show."
"7","Ira: So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake."
"7","Sheldon: Yes."
"7","Ira: And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder."
"7","Sheldon: Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz."
"7","Ira: It’s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure."
"7","Sheldon: Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?"
"7","Ira: That’s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn’t that be unusual? Because you’re a physicist."
"7","Sheldon: Yes, yes, I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don’t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone."
"7","Sheldon: President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one’s worth a dollar."
"7","Amy: I know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, well, I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins."
"7","Leonard: Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys."
"7","Penny: How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it."
"7","Sheldon: But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did."
"7","Penny: Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras."
"7","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"7","Bernadette: Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?"
"7","Howard: I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City."
"7","Bernadette: Come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here."
"7","Howard: Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he’s seen worse."
"7","Bernadette: Howie."
"7","Howard: I promise I’ll help out the rest of the week."
"7","Bernadette: The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two."
"7","Howard: Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?"
"7","Bernadette: No."
"7","Howard: Then you left me no choice."
"7","Bernadette: I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest."
"7","Howard: I know, but they’re tenting his building. He can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs."
"7","Bernadette: He’s bringing Cinnamon?"
"7","Howard: For a whole week, the nerve of some people."
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon is playing with his train set."
"7","Sheldon: Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, can I come in?"
"7","Sheldon: Do you have cookies?"
"7","Amy: No."
"7","Sheldon: Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?"
"7","Wil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. It’s been a while."
"7","Sheldon: Why are you here?"
"7","Wil: Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?"
"7","Sheldon: Certainly. Although, right now, I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did."
"7","Wil: Yeah, I know a little something about that."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad."
"7","Wil: I remember why it’s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek."
"7","Sheldon: How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?"
"7","Wil: Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me."
"7","Sheldon: That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things."
"7","Wil: Yeah, I’m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games."
"7","Amy: Uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so…"
"7","Wil: I’m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher’s shadow. But now, it’s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it’s a part that I’m happy is there."
"7","Sheldon: I do see what you’re saying. That helps."
"7","Wil: Good."
"7","Sheldon: Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?"
"7","Wil: Sure."
"7","Amy: Okay."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch."
"7","Wil:Can I blow the whistle?"
"7","Sheldon: You should probably go."
"7","Howard: You’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?"
"7","Raj: No, I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth."
"7","Howard: Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt."
"7","Raj: And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have dinner?"
"7","Howard: No, we were waiting for you."
"7","Bernadette: Aw, that’s so sweet."
"7","Howard: Yeah. So what do you feel like making?"
"7","Raj: Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner."
"7","Bermadette: Oh, Raj, you’re our guest."
"7","Raj: Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day."
"7","Howard: No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot."
"7","Bernadette: Thank you, Raj."
"7","Raj: Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day."
"7","Bernadette: Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ’cause I was stuck in traffic."
"7","Howard: Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone."
"7","Raj: Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly."
"7","Howard: I thought of you the whole time."
"7","Raj: All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen."
"7","Bernadette: Thank you."
"7","Raj: There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Sheldon: Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard."
"7","Leonard: Hey, you’re in a good mood."
"7","Sheldon: I’m in a great mood."
"7","Leonard: Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results."
"7","Sheldon: Really?"
"7","Leonard: Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away."
"7","Sheldon: So no more interviews?"
"7","Leonard: No, it’s all over."
"7","Sheldon: I can’t believe it."
"7","Leonard: Well, you’re welcome."
"7","Sheldon: You robbed me of my greatest achievement."
"7","Leonard: What?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too."
"7","Leonard: I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy."
"7","Sheldon: By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."
"7","Leonard: Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other."
"7","Sheldon: That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,"
"7","Penny: Hey, what’s with all the yelling?"
"7","Sheldon: Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away."
"7","Penny: Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled,"
"7","Sheldon: That’s it, I’m down to seven friends."
"7","Penny: He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?"
"7","Sheldon: When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world."
"7","Leonard: The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science."
"7","Sheldon: Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight."
"7","Leonard: Will you tell him he’s out of his mind."
"7","Penny: Actually, I get what he’s saying."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy."
"7","Penny: It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."
"7","Sheldon: I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree."
"7","Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does."
"7","Sheldon: No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice."
"7","Leonard: Fine, I’ll publish."
"7","Sheldon: Can you believe this guy?"
"7","Bernadette: Aw! Raj did the dishes."
"7","Howard: How do you know I didn’t do them?"
"7","Bernadette: Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys."
"7","Raj: Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha."
"7","Bernadette: Aw, you didn’t have to do that."
"7","Raj: Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great."
"7","Howard: Yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park."
"7","Bernadette: What presentation do I have today?"
"7","Howard: Just go."
"7","Raj: He loves you."
"7","Howard: What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?"
"7","Raj: I’m just being a good house guest."
"7","Howard: No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?"
"7","Raj: Oh, come on, I brought you one, too."
"7","Howard: I don’t want coffee."
"7","Raj: That’s why I got you hot chocolate."
"7","Howard: Give me that. Just stop showing me up."
"7","Raj: Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom."
"7","Howard: Um, is this getting weird?"
"7","Raj: Hang on."
"7","Howard: So, yes."
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"7","Leonard: Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings."
"7","Sheldon: I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong."
"7","Leonard: These things happen all the time, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit."
"7","Barry: Thew he is. It’s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor."
"7","Leonard: Come on, don’t give him a hard time."
"7","Barry: I’m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team."
"7","Leonard: It’s not a big deal."
"7","Barry: It’s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn’t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving."
"7","Leonard: Okay, Barry, that’s enough."
"7","Sheldon: No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy."
"7","Barry: Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That’s pwetty hurtful. I, I can’t contwol it."
"7","Sheldon: You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back."
"7","Barry: Of course you do. Because you’re the Wetwactor."
"7","Bernadette: Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes."
"7","Raj: Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately."
"7","Bernadette: Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?"
"7","Howard: What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?"
"7","Bernadette: Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj."
"7","Howard: Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, really?"
"7","Howard: Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ’em."
"7","Bernadette: Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em."
"7","Howard: I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them."
"7","Raj: Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back."
"7","Bernadette: This is stupid. Why are we fighting?"
"7","Howard: I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband."
"7","Bernadette: You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife."
"7","Howard: Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him."
"7","Raj: Oh, what did I do?"
"7","Howard: You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough."
"7","Bernadette: Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up."
"7","Raj: Look, I’m sorry you’re upset with me, but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page."
"7","Howard: Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once."
"7","Bernadette: I back you up all the time."
"7","Howard: That is not… he’s doing it again."
"7","Bernadette: What is wrong with you?"
"7","Leonard: I can’t believe they kicked you out."
"7","Raj: I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again."
"7","Penny: Bark once if you need me to call PETA."
"7","Sheldon: What’s that animal doing in our apartment?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out."
"7","Sheldon: I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse."
"7","Penny: You know, if it makes you feel any better…"
"7","Sheldon: It probably won’t."
"7","Penny: You’re probably right."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?"
"7","Raj: Sheldon, I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her."
"7","Amy: Thank you, Rajesh."
"7","Raj: And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms."
"7","Amy: You should probably go."
"7","Scene: The radio studio."
"7","Ira: I’m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I’d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen."
"7","Leonard: Thanks."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week."
"7","Ira: It’s all right."
"7","Sheldon: Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?"
"7","Ira: No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?"
"7","Leonard: Well…"
"7","Sheldon: I believe I can answer that."
"7","Leonard: He asked me."
"7","Sheldon: Fine."
"7","Leonard: As I was saying…"
"7","Sheldon: You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…"
"7","Leonard: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium."
"7","Ira: You know, I’d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it’s okay with you."
"7","Sheldon: What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?"
"7","Ira: Actually, I didn’t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I’m not comfortable with confrontation."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me."
"7","Sheldon: Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio."
"7","Penny (listening in her apartment): You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
"7","(listening in her apartment)"
"7","Amy: A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?"
"7","Sheldon: You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)"
"7","(Does)"
"7","Amy: I’ll get the vodka."
"7","Series 07 Episode 11 – The Cooper Extraction"
"7","Scene: The apartment. Penny and Amy are playing a ski-ing game."
"7","Penny: Wow, you’re really good at this."
"7","Amy: Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I’m like a pyramid."
"7","Penny: How you doing over there?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury."
"7","Penny: Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I would, but I’m on my way out."
"7","Leonard: Where?"
"7","Sheldon: Texas."
"7","Amy: Right now? Why?"
"7","Leonard: Is someone sick?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby."
"7","Penny: Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper."
"7","Amy: How come you never said she was pregnant?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?"
"7","Leonard: Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister."
"7","Sheldon: Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck."
"7","Penny: Wow, so, how long will you be gone?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?"
"7","Amy: Can I give you a ride to the airport?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no, thank you, I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Leonard: All right, here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window."
"7","Penny: Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template."
"7","Leonard: And I’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars."
"7","Penny: Ah."
"7","Raj: Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?"
"7","Leonard: I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. (All whoop)"
"7","(All whoop)"
"7","Howard: I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun."
"7","Raj: Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack."
"7","Bernadette: Good idea, I’ll take a picture."
"7","Penny: Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this."
"7","Leonard: I love it."
"7","Penny: Okay."
"7","Leonard: But it is what you got me last year."
"7","Penny: Yeah."
"7","Leonard: And last night."
"7","Stuart: Hello."
"7","Various: Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc"
"7","Stuart: Oh, good, I’m glad you guys didn’t wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it’s, it’s seven, but that’s fine."
"7","Amy (ringing from tablet): Oh, it’s probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody’s here, say hi."
"7","(ringing from tablet)"
"7","Penny: Hi."
"7","Leonard: Hey, buddy."
"7","Raj: Hey."
"7","Howard: Howdy."
"7","Bernadette: Hi."
"7","Sheldon: The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?"
"7","Amy: Yeah, kinda."
"7","Sheldon: That’s so thoughtful. You guys are the best."
"7","Penny: Hey, how’s your sister?"
"7","Sheldon: <i>She went into labor an hour ago."
"7","Amy: That’s wonderful. So you’re at the hospital?"
"7","Sheldon: No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn’t available."
"7","Raj: You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones."
"7","Sheldon: And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide."
"7","Mrs Cooper (off): Shelly, come on. Your sister’s fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there’s blood everywhere."
"7","(off)"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt."
"7","Raj: If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?"
"7","Penny: Yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby, I’ll give you ten dollars."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later."
"7","Amy: Oh, I love that movie."
"7","Raj: I’ve never seen it."
"7","Stuart: Me neither."
"7","Amy: It’s great. It’s Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself."
"7","Stuart: Don’t need to see it. Living it."
"7","Bernadette: But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born."
"7","Penny: Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?"
"7","Leonard: (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think?"
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Amy: You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, I don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now."
"7","Howard: Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I’m in this room."
"7","Amy: It’s true. None of you would know me. You wouldn’t know Bernadette. You wouldn’t be dating Penny."
"7","Leonard: You don’t know that. I’ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up. (General laughter)"
"7","(General laughter)"
"7","Penny: Oh, you weren’t joking."
"7","Leonard: No."
"7","Penny: Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down."
"7","Fantasy sequence in Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Leonard: I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out."
"7","Howard: I’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen."
"7","Raj: Maybe this time he’s going to do it."
"7","Howard: Hope you’re thirsty, here it comes."
"7","Leonard: Watch me."
"7","Penny: Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?"
"7","Leonard: I, uh, ah, um, I…"
"7","Penny: A few minutes it is."
"7","Raj: You didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds."
"7","Leonard: You guys are making me nervous."
"7","Howard: Fine, then go talk to her on your own."
"7","Leonard: I will. Excuse me."
"7","Penny: Yeah?"
"7","Leonard: Hi, uh, um, I’m Leonard?"
"7","Penny: Really? You don’t sound so sure."
"7","Leonard: No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something I’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um."
"7","Penny: What’s that?"
"7","Leonard: Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?"
"7","Penny: I think you’re too late."
"7","End fantasy sequence"
"7","Leonard: Come on, I would not have peed my pants."
"7","Howard: She nailed it."
"7","Raj: Sounds about right."
"7","Leonard: But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life."
"7","Amy: Which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn’t with Penny, she never would have set you up."
"7","Howard: Doesn’t matter. Bernadette still would’ve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. You would’ve been all over me."
"7","Bernadette: Well…"
"7","Fantasy sequence in the Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, Penny, can I take that table?"
"7","Penny: Sure, why?"
"7","Bernadette: The one in the turtleneck is cute."
"7","Raj: Open wide, here comes the happy train."
"7","Howard: Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum."
"7","Raj: Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah."
"7","Bernadette: Never mind."
"7","End fantasy sequence."
"7","Raj: Oh, man, that is so us."
"7","Leonard: You know, maybe you and I wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself."
"7","Penny: Why?"
"7","Leonard: Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with."
"7","Fantasy sequence in Penny’s apartment."
"7","Zack: Hey, babe."
"7","Penny: Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?"
"7","Zack: Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans."
"7","Penny: Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself."
"7","Leonard: Oh, hold on."
"7","Fantasy sequence."
"7","Zack: Aw, babe, I peed myself."
"7","Penny: Me, too."
"7","Leonard: The end."
"7","Amy (Tablet ringing): Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?"
"7","(Tablet ringing):"
"7","Sheldon: No, it’s not. I’ve seen things. Lady things."
"7","Amy: Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look."
"7","Sheldon: Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show."
"7","Mrs Cooper (off): Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop."
"7","Sheldon: Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal."
"7","Leonard: Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there’s pictures. Aah! Don’t open them. Do not open them."
"7","Penny: Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half."
"7","Raj: My father’s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I’m gay."
"7","Bernadette: You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him."
"7","Amy: And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean."
"7","Penny: We do?"
"7","Fantasy sequence in the Laundry Room."
"7","Penny: Hey, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Penny: Doing laundry?"
"7","Sheldon: Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified."
"7","Penny: Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them."
"7","Penny: Okay, that’s enough."
"7","Leonard: Disagree."
"7","Raj: Keep going."
"7","Howard: More."
"7","Penny: So, what do you think?"
"7","Sheldon: A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about."
"7","Penny: Please, Sheldon. I need you."
"7","Sheldon: To what?"
"7","Penny: To take me."
"7","Sheldon: I’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt."
"7","Penny: Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here."
"7","Sheldon: Penny, for the thousandth time, I’m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud."
"7","Penny: I think I know how to change your mind."
"7","Leonard: That’s enough."
"7","Raj: Ew."
"7","Stuart: I was okay with it."
"7","Amy (tablet ringing): How’s it going, Sheldon?"
"7","(tablet ringing)"
"7","Sheldon: Actually, much better."
"7","Leonard: Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?"
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know. I just got back."
"7","Amy: Where’d you go?"
"7","Sheldon: My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. (Scream from other room) Excuse me, I’m on the phone. So rude."
"7","(Scream from other room)"
"7","Amy: Here’s another one. Penny, if it weren’t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee."
"7","Penny: Great."
"7","Raj: At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?"
"7","Leonard: We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom."
"7","Howard: I lived with her to save money."
"7","Raj: Yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding."
"7","Bernadette: Aw, so I guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?"
"7","Howard: Not exactly."
"7","Penny: What do you mean, not exactly?"
"7","Howard: Well, things would be a little different."
"7","Fantasy sequence in Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, where’s my lunch? I’m starving."
"7","Howard: I know you’re starving. The neighbours know you’re starving. There’s starving people in Africa who know you’re starving."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): That’s it? There’s not enough food."
"7","Howard:Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don’t know what else to do."
"7","Bernadette: How is this any different?"
"7","Howard: You didn’t let me finish. Here you go, Mother."
"7","Dead Mrs Wolowitz: You’re a good boy, Howard, such a good boy."
"7","Amy: Wait, did she die or did you kill her?"
"7","Howard: Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she’s dead."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man."
"7","Raj: Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time."
"7","Fantasy scene in Raj’s apartment."
"7","Raj: Come on, Leonard, dinner."
"7","Fat Leonard: Coming."
"7","Leonard: Hang on. Why would I be fat?"
"7","Raj: You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake."
"7","Leonard: Why can’t you be fat, too?"
"7","Fat Leonard: What do you want to do for dessert?"
"7","Fat Raj: I think there’s still half a cake from breakfast."
"7","Fat Leonard: No, there’s not."
"7","Fat Stuart: Hey, guys."
"7","Fat Leonard and Raj: Stuart!"
"7","Raj: What are you doing?"
"7","Stuart: I just wanted to be in anyone’s story."
"7","Raj: Yeah, but why are you fat?"
"7","Stuart: ‘Cause Leonard was fat."
"7","Penny: Amy, what about you? What do you think you’d be doing if you never met Sheldon?"
"7","Amy: It’s hard to say, my life would be so different."
"7","Howard: You can say better. Sheldon can’t hear you."
"7","Amy: I don’t know."
"7","Fantasy sequence in Amy’s apartment."
"7","Amy: Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)"
"7","(Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)"
"7","Stuart: I’ll stop now."
"7","Sheldon: That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy."
"7","Penny: Aw."
"7","Amy: Yay."
"7","Raj: Congrats."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this."
"7","Leonard: Well, good for you, buddy. We’ll let you get back in there."
"7","Sheldon: Oh no, no, I’m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life."
"7","Howard: Aw, he’s already taking after Uncle Shelly."
"7","Amy: Come on, Sheldon, you should go."
"7","Sheldon: Why?"
"7","Amy: Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew."
"7","Sheldon: Ugh, all right, I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control."
"7","Bernadette: You actually got him to do it."
"7","Rajj: Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him."
"7","Amy: If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it."
"7","Leonard: I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think."
"7","Amy: I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon."
"7","Leonard: Hang on, I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. Look."
"7","Amy: I don’t understand."
"7","Leonard: He made you his screensaver."
"7","Amy: Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, well, it’s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you’re in the mix."
"7","Amy: I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one."
"7","Penny: Who’s that?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, Madame Curie."
"7","Amy: That’s fine, she’s dead."
"7","Scene: The stairwell."
"7","Sheldon: You okay?"
"7","Amy: Just really glad you’re back."
"7","Sheldon: Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on."
"7","Amy: I missed you."
"7","Sheldon: To quote Han Solo, I know."
"7","Amy: Did you miss me?"
"7","Sheldon: I would’ve preferred to have you there with me."
"7","Amy: Oh."
"7","Sheldon: Or instead of me."
"7","Amy: Did you hold the baby?"
"7","Sheldon: I did."
"7","Amy: And? How did it make you feel?"
"7","Sheldon: Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office."
"7","Fantasy sequence at the Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Fat Leonard: I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out."
"7","Howard: And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples."
"7","Fat Raj: Put up or shut up. You make it, I’ll drink it."
"7","Penny: You guys need anything else?"
"7","Fat Leonard: Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake."
"7","Penny: I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?"
"7","Stuart: Not until I get my kiss."
"7","Series 07 Episode 12 – The Hesitation Ramification"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Amy: This is nice, that we all get to eat together."
"7","Leonard: Absolutely."
"7","Amy: Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?"
"7","Sheldon: We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to."
"7","Penny: Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this."
"7","Leonard: What happened?"
"7","Penny: I just got a part on a TV show."
"7","Amy: Congratulations."
"7","Leonard: What? That’s great. Guys."
"7","Howard: Oh, yeah"
"7","Sheldon: Yay, Penny."
"7","Amy: What’s the show?"
"7","Penny: Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!"
"7","Leonard: That’s amazing."
"7","Penny: Yeah."
"7","Howard: What’s your part?"
"7","Penny: Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon."
"7","Raj: Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat."
"7","Leonard: So it, it’s just flirting?"
"7","Penny: Well, yeah. Why?"
"7","Leonard: Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination."
"7","Amy: He’s wrong."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Raj: So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number."
"7","Leonard: Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?"
"7","Raj: I don’t see why not."
"7","Howard: If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom."
"7","Sheldon: Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic."
"7","Leonard: It’s a joke."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t."
"7","Penny: Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night."
"7","Howard: We’ll be there."
"7","Raj: Can we bring anything?"
"7","Penny: Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat."
"7","Sheldon: Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you."
"7","Scene: The stairwell."
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, do you think I’m funny?"
"7","Leonard: No. Do you?"
"7","Sheldon: I think I’m hysterical."
"7","Leonard: I take it back. That was funny."
"7","Sheldon: The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object."
"7","Leonard: I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher."
"7","Leonard: You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem."
"7","Sheldon: Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd."
"7","Leonard: Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…"
"7","Sheldon: I don’t get it."
"7","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"7","Bernadette: Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart."
"7","Howard: Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else."
"7","Raj: I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?"
"7","Bernadette: Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way."
"7","Stuart: When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum."
"7","Raj: Are possums cute?"
"7","Stuart: Not at all."
"7","Howard: If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people."
"7","Raj: You mean like fatties and uggos?"
"7","Bernadette: Or maybe just stop talking."
"7","Howard: I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary."
"7","Bernadette: Or just keep dating the possum."
"7","Voice on television: Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources."
"7","Second voice: No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…"
"7","Leonard: I’m so proud of you."
"7","Penny: We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet."
"7","Leonard: I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this."
"7","Amy: Why?"
"7","Sheldon: I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural."
"7","Amy: Just think of the first 245 as the prequel."
"7","Sheldon: All right."
"7","Penny: Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it."
"7","Man on TV: I guess it’s you and me, kid."
"7","Mark Harmon on TV: What are you doing?"
"7","Woman on TV: I’m trying to make peace."
"7","Mark Harmon on TV: We’re good."
"7","Woman on TV: Good."
"7","Mark Harmon on TV: Really? Because…"
"7","Penny: Are you kidding me?"
"7","Leonard: What’s wrong?"
"7","Penny: Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost."
"7","Penny: No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone."
"7","Bernadette: What happened?"
"7","Penny: They must’ve cut it."
"7","Leonard: Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry."
"7","Howard: That stinks."
"7","Raj: I’m sure you were great."
"7","Penny: This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me."
"7","Sheldon: I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny (on phone): No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye."
"7","(on phone)"
"7","Leonard: How you doing?"
"7","Penny: Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating."
"7","Leonard: You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment."
"7","Penny: Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen."
"7","Leonard: Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway."
"7","Penny: Unbelievable."
"7","Leonard: Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant."
"7","Penny: Then what did you mean?"
"7","Leonard: I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things."
"7","Penny: I think you meant that you don’t believe in me."
"7","Leonard: Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way."
"7","Penny: I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion."
"7","Leonard: Right."
"7","Penny: Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?"
"7","Leonard: Yes."
"7","Penny: So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards."
"7","Leonard: Honestly?"
"7","Penny: Yes, honestly."
"7","Leonard: I don’t."
"7","Penny: How could you say that?"
"7","Leonard: I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly."
"7","Penny: Oh."
"7","Leonard: Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that."
"7","Penny: No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life."
"7","Leonard: That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one."
"7","Penny: Wow, thank you."
"7","Leonard: Should’ve let Sheldon come."
"7","Sheldon: This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise."
"7","Amy: Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…"
"7","Sheldon: BRAIN LESIONS!"
"7","Amy: Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny."
"7","Sheldon: Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex."
"7","Amy: Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological… (Sheldon drops his trousers) Okay, that’s pretty good."
"7","(Sheldon drops his trousers)"
"7","Sheldon: Excellent."
"7","Scene: The mall."
"7","Stuart: How about her?"
"7","Raj: No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls."
"7","Stuart: Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?"
"7","Raj: That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?"
"7","Stuart: We’ll find somebody else."
"7","Sheldon: Kumquat?"
"7","Amy: I guess."
"7","Sheldon: Ointment?"
"7","Amy: Sure."
"7","Sheldon: Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?"
"7","Amy: I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore."
"7","Sheldon: Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?"
"7","Sheldon: All of them."
"7","Penny: You didn’t get your part cut."
"7","Voice on TV: All right, baby, here’s the deal."
"7","Penny: And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!"
"7","Leonard: Hey. Can we talk?"
"7","Penny: We can, but the part of Penny might get cut."
"7","Leonard: That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them."
"7","Penny: Thank you."
"7","Leonard: And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition."
"7","Penny: Are you serious? For what?"
"7","Leonard: The new Star Wars movie."
"7","Penny: What? How did you manage that?"
"7","Leonard: There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it."
"7","Penny: Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt."
"7","Leonard: So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago."
"7","Penny: Really, let it go."
"7","Leonard: Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now."
"7","Stuart: How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?"
"7","Raj: Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard."
"7","Stuart: We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins."
"7","Raj: I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here."
"7","Amy: Hello."
"7","Bernadette: Hey."
"7","Howard: Where’s Sheldon?"
"7","Amy: He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour."
"7","Bernadette: That’s interesting."
"7","Amy: It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?"
"7","Bernadette: If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh."
"7","Howard: Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?"
"7","Bernadette: No, of course not."
"7","Howard: Well, I’d be able to tell anyway."
"7","Bernadette: I don’t think you would."
"7","Howard: Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. (Bernadette laughs uncontrollably) Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms."
"7","(Bernadette laughs uncontrollably)"
"7","Leonard (on phone): Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?"
"7","Penny: Hey."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, I’ll call you back."
"7","Penny: Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic."
"7","Leonard: Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic."
"7","Penny: Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart."
"7","Leonard: Come on. It’s okay."
"7","Penny: No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess."
"7","Leonard: No, you’re not."
"7","Penny: Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there."
"7","Leonard: Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback."
"7","Penny: No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it."
"7","Leonard: Well, you have me."
"7","Penny: You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married."
"7","Leonard: What?"
"7","Penny: Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?"
"7","Leonard: Um…"
"7","Penny: Did you seriously just say um?"
"7","Leonard: Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost."
"7","Penny: Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?"
"7","Leonard: That is not what I said."
"7","Penny: No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table."
"7","Sheldon: Who’s in the mood to laugh?"
"7","Leonard: Really not a good time."
"7","Sheldon: But I used science to construct the perfect joke."
"7","Penny: I’m gonna go."
"7","Leonard: Penny, don’t."
"7","Penny: No, no, I just need to be alone."
"7","Sheldon: So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?"
"7","Leonard: To my room."
"7","Sheldon: Should I follow you?"
"7","Leonard: No."
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, wait."
"7","Sheldon: I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous."
"7","Stuart: How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them."
"7","Raj: That’s a mirror."
"7","Stuart: Oh, yeah."
"7","Security Guard: Hey, fellas, mall’s closing."
"7","Raj: Sorry."
"7","Security Guard: Yeah. Good night."
"7","Raj: Uh, excuse me."
"7","Security Guard: Yeah?"
"7","Raj: Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?"
"7","Security Guard: It’s all right."
"7","Raj: Okay, nice talking to you."
"7","Stuart: Smooth."
"7","Sheldon: Can’t sleep?"
"7","Sheldon: Would you like to talk about it?"
"7","Leonard: Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes."
"7","Sheldon: Why not?"
"7","Leonard: That’s a good question."
"7","Sheldon: Does that mean the relationship is over?"
"7","Leonard: I don’t know."
"7","Sheldon: Why don’t you ask her?"
"7","Leonard: Because I’m afraid to know the answer."
"7","Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry."
"7","Leonard: That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?"
"7","Sheldon: No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry."
"7","Leonard: Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?"
"7","Sheldon: No. That wouldn’t be funny at all."
"7","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"7","Howard: Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…"
"7","Bernadette: How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?"
"7","Howard: I’m in the middle of something."
"7","Bernadette: So am I."

"7","Sheldon: It’s an outrage."
"7","Leonard: I know."
"7","Sheldon: The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it."
"7","Leonard: You need to let it go, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get."
"7","Leonard: Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days."
"7","Sheldon: But I don’t want a vacation."
"7","Leonard: Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?"
"7","Leonard: It doesn’t."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you."
"7","Leonard: I’m gonna go talk to Penny."
"7","Sheldon: I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. (Leonard knocks three times) Penny. Sorry."
"7","(Leonard knocks three times)"
"7","Penny: Hi."
"7","Leonard: Hey."
"7","Penny: Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think."
"7","Leonard: Okay."
"7","Penny: Yeah. Come in."
"7","Leonard: Look, if you want to break up, just say it."
"7","Penny: Leonard…"
"7","Leonard: No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents."
"7","Penny: Listen, I don’t want to break up with you."
"7","Leonard: Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?"
"7","Penny: Yeah, I probably wouldn’t."
"7","Leonard: Yeah."
"7","Penny: Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere."
"7","Leonard: Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do."
"7","Penny: Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Leonard: Wow. That, that’s a big step."
"7","Penny: I know."

"7","Stuart: Hey."
"7","Bernadette: Sorry. Did I startle you?"
"7","Stuart: Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?"
"7","Bernadette: Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it."
"7","Stuart: Wow. What happened?"

"7","Stuart: Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not."
"7","Bernadette: Do you have this one?"
"7","Stuart: Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?"
"7","Bernadette: Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work."
"7","Stuart: Oh. What’s the hurry?"
"7","Bernadette: Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right."
"7","Stuart: Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises."
"7","Bernadette: You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants."
"7","Stuart: Really? Do you have any of these?"
"7","Scene: Amy’s laboratory."
"7","Amy: Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?"
"7","Howard: Anybody home?"
"7","Amy: Hey, what brings you guys here?"
"7","Raj: Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join."
"7","Amy: Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse."
"7","Bert: Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company."
"7","Amy: That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert."
"7","Howard: Hi."
"7","Raj: Hey. Good to see you."
"7","Bert: Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab."
"7","Amy: This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department."
"7","Bert: Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?"
"7","Howard: You’re both into rock?"
"7","Bert: Yeah. Well, see ya."
"7","Amy: Oh, you forgot your quartz."
"7","Bert: Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye."
"7","Amy: He’s nice."
"7","Howard: Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you."
"7","Amy: What?! No, he doesn’t."
"7","Raj: He brought you a pretty rock."
"7","Amy: So? He does that every day. Oh."
"7","Howard: You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay."
"7","Amy: He’s not my boyfriend."
"7","Raj: Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type."
"7","Amy: Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?"
"7","Raj: Yeah, grow up, Howard. God."
"7","Amy: What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings."
"7","Howard: Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?"
"7","Amy: I guess it hasn’t come up."
"7","Howard: There you go."
"7","Raj: And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?"
"7","Amy: I’m sorry. Who are you dating?"
"7","Raj: Yeah, knock it off, Howard."
"7","Penny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Penny: You okay?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m on vacation. What do you think?"
"7","Penny: Why are you sitting in the stairwell?"
"7","Sheldon: Leonard told me to stay."
"7","Penny: Oh. Well, good boy."
"7","Sheldon: Where are you going?"
"7","Penny: Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class."
"7","Sheldon: Well, have fun."
"7","Penny: Okay. You want to come with me?"
"7","Sheldon: Really?"
"7","Penny: Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on."
"7","Stuart (on phone): All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics."
"7","(on phone)"
"7","Bernadette: Oh, that’s great."
"7","Stuart: No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?"
"7","Stuart: You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Amy: Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?"
"7","Howard: So, what is she doing today?"
"7","Leonard: I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her."
"7","Raj: Well, do you support this?"
"7","Leonard: Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk."
"7","Amy: That’s nice."
"7","Leonard: You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey."
"7","Penny: Hi. What’s up?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?"
"7","Penny: Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Leonard: You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane."
"7","Penny: Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform."
"7","Scene: Penny’s car."
"7","Voice: Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment."
"7","Sheldon: Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider."
"7","Voice: Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out."
"7","Sheldon: Wow. Didn’t see that coming."
"7","Voice: In."
"7","Sheldon: Let me guess."
"7","Voice: And out."
"7","Sheldon: What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?"
"7","Penny: I didn’t get it."
"7","Sheldon: A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time."
"7","Penny: Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?"
"7","Sheldon: Do you see me drinking lemonade?"
"7","Penny: No. I’m serious."
"7","Sheldon: Why do you ask?"
"7","Penny: Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?"
"7","Sheldon: No, I don’t think you are."
"7","Penny: Really?"
"7","Sheldon: The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year."
"7","Penny: Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?"
"7","Sheldon: Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers."
"7","Penny: Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car."
"7","Bert: Hey."
"7","Amy: Hello, Bert."
"7","Bert: So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica."
"7","Amy: Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend."
"7","Bert: Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show."
"7","Amy: Weren’t you?"
"7","Bert: Yeah."
"7","Amy: That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend."
"7","Bert: That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality."
"7","Amy: No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you."
"7","Bert: Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me."
"7","Amy: Don’t say that."
"7","Bert: It’s okay. I know I’m a monster."
"7","Amy: No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you."
"7","Bert: Sweet. It’s a date."
"7","Amy: No, it’s not."
"7","Bert: Too late."
"7","Scene: Capital Comics."
"7","Bernadette: Wow."
"7","Stuart: Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window."
"7","Jesse: Hey, Stuart."
"7","Stuart: Jesse."
"7","Jesse: Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten."
"7","Stuart: My hair’s exactly the same colour as always."
"7","Jesse: No, I was talking about your skin."
"7","Stuart: Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book."
"7","Jesse: Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here."
"7","Stuart: Even you, Sweatpants?"
"7","Sweatpants: Free popcorn."
"7","Jesse: Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?"
"7","Bernadette: No, thanks."
"7","Jesse: How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?"
"7","Bernadette: Hey."
"7","Jesse: I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is."
"7","Stuart: It’s on Merton Avenue."
"7","Bernadette: I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend."
"7","Jesse: Sorry. You want the book or not?"
"7","Bernadette: Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart."
"7","Stuart: You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important."
"7","Jesse: What’s that?"
"7","Stuart: Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this."
"7","Howard: The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert."
"7","Amy: So what am I supposed to do now?"
"7","Raj: Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?"
"7","Amy: This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him."
"7","Howard: Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel."
"7","Raj: Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury."
"7","Howard: Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino."
"7","Raj: Megan Pincus."
"7","Howard: Tammy Cho."
"7","Raj: Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?"
"7","Howard: Arlene Russel."
"7","Raj: Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos."
"7","Howard: Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him."
"7","Amy: Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?"
"7","Raj: I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way."
"7","Howard: That’s how you reject a guy."
"7","Amy: Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest."
"7","Howard: No, don’t."
"7","Raj: He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes."
"7","Howard: You want us to talk to him?"
"7","Amy: Really? You would do that?"
"7","Raj: Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect."
"7","Amy: Thank you."
"7","Howard: Let’s go."
"7","Raj: So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?"
"7","Howard: Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian."
"7","Scene: The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga."
"7","Penny: And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold."
"7","Sheldon: I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals."
"7","Penny: Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today."
"7","Sheldon: Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze."
"7","Leonard: Oh, hey."
"7","Penny: And now we go to Reverse Warrior."
"7","Leonard: How did she get you to do yoga?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda."
"7","Penny: I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me."
"7","Leonard: Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you."
"7","Penny: Sheldon, take a break."
"7","Sheldon: Namaste."
"7","Penny: Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?"
"7","Leonard: Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?"
"7","Penny: Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?"
"7","Leonard: Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in."
"7","Penny: Yeah, well, maybe we do."
"7","Sheldon: I’m willing to if you guys are."
"7","Leonard: Can we please have some privacy?"
"7","Sheldon: Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?"
"7","Sheldon: Penny?"
"7","Penny: Okay, wait. What are we doing?"
"7","Leonard: For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever."
"7","Sheldon: Good. Now we’re getting somewhere."
"7","Penny: Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22."
"7","Leonard: I swear, I am on your side."
"7","Penny: You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it."
"7","Sheldon: He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?"
"7","Leonard: Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified."
"7","Penny: Well, it’s scary for me, too."
"7","Sheldon: I’m fine with it."
"7","Leonard: My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you."
"7","Penny: Okay. Thank you."
"7","Sheldon: Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw."
"7","Jesse: You’re back."
"7","Bernadette: Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now."
"7","Jesse: No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?"
"7","Bernadette: No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone."
"7","Jesse: I only have chocolate chip."
"7","Bernadette: Well, that sounds even better."
"7","Scene: Bert’s car."
"7","Bert: Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me."
"7","Raj: We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go."
"7","Howard: Really, really sorry."
"7","Bert: Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!"
"7","Series 07 Episode 14 – The Convention Conundrum"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Howard: T-minus 60 seconds."
"7","Raj: Oh, it all comes down to this."
"7","Leonard: Oh, I’ve got butterflies."
"7","Sheldon: Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face."
"7","Penny: What’s going on?"
"7","Leonard: Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con."
"7","Penny: Oh."
"7","Howard: T Minus 45 seconds."
"7","Leonard: They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…"
"7","Sheldon: Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants."
"7","Penny: This is a whole lot of weird before coffee."
"7","Howard: T-minus 30 seconds."
"7","Raj: Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad."
"7","Sheldon: Every year. I told you, wear a diaper."
"7","Raj: And I told you I get diaper rash."
"7","Howard: 15 seconds."
"7","Leonard: Well, this is it, this is it. This is it."
"7","Howard: Five, four, three, two, one."
"7","Sheldon: It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go."
"7","Raj: Anyone in?"
"7","Sheldon: No."
"7","Leonard: Not yet."
"7","Howard: Nope."
"7","Sheldon: Do not stop refreshing your screens."
"7","All (repeatedly): Refresh. Refresh. Refresh…."
"7","(repeatedly)"
"7","Penny: Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The same, shortly after."
"7","All (repeatedly): Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…"
"7","Howard: It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time."
"7","Penny: To be cool? Yeah."
"7","Leonard: I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue."
"7","Sheldon: Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes."
"7","Raj: Uh, what number in line are you?"
"7","Leonard: Uh, fifteen…"
"7","Howard: Great."
"7","Leonard: …thousand two hundred and eleven."
"7","Howard: Damn."
"7","Raj: Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left."
"7","Howard: Really?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL."
"7","Leonard: Sunday’s gone."
"7","Sheldon: Not Sunday, I love Sunday."
"7","Raj: So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah."
"7","Howard: I can’t believe we’re not going."
"7","Sheldon: It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me."
"7","Penny: Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago."
"7","Sheldon: I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes."
"7","Penny: What? You were all going as the Hulk?"
"7","Howard: Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo."
"7","Raj: We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball."
"7","All: Yeah."
"7","Penny: And we’re back to the first kind of sad."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us."
"7","Sheldon: I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days."
"7","Leonard: Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets."
"7","Howard: I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell."
"7","Sheldon: How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?"
"7","Leonard: The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me."
"7","Howard: Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention."
"7","Sheldon: You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off."
"7","Sheldon (on phone): Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me."
"7","(on phone)"
"7","Leonard: Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?"
"7","Sheldon: I didn’t even get to that part."
"7","Leonard: Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time."
"7","Sheldon: Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you."
"7","Sheldon: You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list."
"7","Leonard: Good luck."
"7","Sheldon: No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny: I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets."
"7","Amy: Last week, you spent that on a little dress."
"7","Penny: Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want."
"7","Bernadette: Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away."
"7","Amy: Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?"
"7","Bernadette: Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up."
"7","Amy: Oh. You mean like a museum?"
"7","Penny: Yes, like a museum, but anything else."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea."
"7","Amy: Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us."
"7","Penny: Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear."
"7","Bernadette: La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear."
"7","Penny: No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way."
"7","Raj: Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as."
"7","Leonard: Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us."
"7","Howard: Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over."
"7","Sheldon: Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
"7","Leonard: Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?"
"7","Sheldon: I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader."
"7","Raj: How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?"
"7","Sheldon: Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…"
"7","Howard: And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble."
"7","Sheldon: You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there. (To the Imperial March theme) Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…"
"7","(To the Imperial March theme)"
"7","Scene: The same, later."
"7","Howard (on phone): Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late."
"7","Raj: Does he sound like a criminal?"
"7","Howard: What do you mean?"
"7","Raj: You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?"
"7","Leonard: Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940."
"7","Raj: I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?"
"7","Howard: Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?"
"7","Raj: I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?"
"7","Leonard: Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location."
"7","Howard: Why do you think I told him to come to your place?"
"7","Scene: Hotel tea room."
"7","Amy: There sure are a lot of little kids here."
"7","Penny: I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up."
"7","Bernadette: I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter."
"7","Amy: Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster."
"7","Bernadette: That’s cute."
"7","Amy: It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast."
"7","Bernadette: Should we leave?"
"7","Penny: Well, there’s a bar in the lobby."
"7","Bernadette: I could go for a drink."
"7","Amy: Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy."
"7","Scene: A sushi restaurant."
"7","James Earl Jones: Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?"
"7","Sheldon: Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker."
"7","James Earl Jones: Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie."
"7","Sheldon: He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is."
"7","Raj: Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message."
"7","Leonard: Maybe this isn’t a good idea."
"7","Howard: I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds."
"7","Raj: Do it."
"7","Howard: Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con."
"7","Leonard: Hold on. We always do this."
"7","Howard: Do what?"
"7","Leonard: Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong."
"7","Raj: That’s ’cause we’re the good guys."
"7","Leonard: Even Batman breaks the rules."
"7","Raj: You know I struggle with Batman."
"7","Leonard: I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses."
"7","Raj: Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too."
"7","Leonard: Howard, you in on this?"
"7","Howard: No need. I’m breaking rules all the time."
"7","Leonard: Name one."
"7","Howard: Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle."
"7","Raj: What about that little cup they give you?"
"7","Howard: Yeah. What about it?"
"7","Raj: Are you impressed by that?"
"7","Leonard: A little."
"7","Raj: Yeah, me, too."
"7","Scene: The sushi restaurant."
"7","James: You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying."
"7","Sheldon: Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?"
"7","James: He was not. How messed up was that?"
"7","Sheldon: So messed up."
"7","James: What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket."
"7","Scene: The hotel bar."
"7","Penny: So, afternoon tea was a bust."
"7","Amy: On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good."
"7","Penny: Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do."
"7","Bernadette: Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids."
"7","Penny: Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me."
"7","Amy: Gosh."
"7","Penny: I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there."
"7","Amy: I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man."
"7","Penny: Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up."
"7","Bernadette: Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here."
"7","Penny: Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?"
"7","Howard: He just parked. He’s on his way up."
"7","Leonard: Good. This is exciting."
"7","Raj: It is. I feel alive."
"7","Leonard: Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con."
"7","Raj: Maybe slapped with a fine."
"7","Howard: Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?"
"7","Raj: Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?"
"7","Leonard: I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants."
"7","Raj: He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?"
"7","Howard: Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away."
"7","Raj: I thought you were a badass."
"7","Howard: I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup."
"7","Scene: An ice cream parlour."
"7","Sheldon: Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?"
"7","James: It is true."
"7","Sheldon: Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?"
"7","James: They sure did."
"7","Sheldon: Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?"
"7","James: That’s right."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night."
"7","Penny: I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?"
"7","Bernadette: Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways."
"7","Penny: I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car."
"7","Amy: I told you it was Penny."
"7","Penny: Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened."
"7","Amy: Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are."
"7","Scene: The apartment. Banging on door."
"7","Howard: Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now."
"7","Scene: A big wheel."
"7","Sheldon: Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think."
"7","James: I am."
"7","Scene: A karaoke bar."
"7","Sheldon: In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…"
"7","James: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…"
"7","Sheldon: Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh."
"7","Sceme: Outside a house."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t understand what we’re doing."
"7","James: Shh."
"7","Sheldon: Whose house is this?"
"7","James: Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to run. (Rings doorbell)"
"7","(Rings doorbell)"
"7","Carrie Fisher: It’s not funny anymore, James."
"7","James: Then why am I laughing?"
"7","Scene: A sauna."
"7","James: Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night."
"7","Sheldon: Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke."
"7","James: What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?"
"7","James: No. Something about a convention."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist."
"7","James: Why don’t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?"
"7","Sheldon: Really?"
"7","James: Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every night."
"7","Sheldon: Ay-yi-yi."
"7","James: Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang."
"7","James: So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun."
"7","Sheldon: I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?"

"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Amy: Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision."
"7","Sheldon: I submitted you a notarised list."
"7","Amy: I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please."
"7","Amy: We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day."
"7","Sheldon: Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey."
"7","Amy: Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy."
"7","Sheldon: People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one."
"7","Amy: I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley."
"7","Sheldon: I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a."
"7","Amy: Come on, Sheldon. Why not?"
"7","Sheldon: For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table."
"7","Amy: One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk."
"7","Amy: I got you your own room."
"7","Sheldon: What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?"
"7","Amy: It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster."
"7","Sheldon: Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me."
"7","Amy: We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train."
"7","Sheldon: Vintage? Be specific."
"7","Amy: An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches."
"7","Sheldon: Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Bernadette: Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room."
"7","Penny: No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home."
"7","Leonard: Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs."
"7","Penny: That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on."
"7","Sheldon: Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?"
"7","Howard: I’m sorry, what?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing."
"7","Howard: I don’t own a pocket watch."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot."
"7","Raj: Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?"
"7","Penny: You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it."
"7","Raj: I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night."
"7","Amy: Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic."
"7","Raj: Except I’ll be alone."
"7","Amy: I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me."
"7","Leonard: We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon."
"7","Penny: Yeah."
"7","Raj: Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room."
"7","Penny: Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy."
"7","Scene: The Pullman dining car."
"7","Amy: What do you think, Sheldon?"
"7","Sheldon: It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever."
"7","Amy: I’m so glad you like it."
"7","Sheldon: I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard."
"7","Leonard (on phone): Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. (To Cinnamon) That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?"
"7","(on phone)"
"7","(To Cinnamon)"
"7","Penny: Happy Valentine’s Day."
"7","Leonard: Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties."
"7","Penny: Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it."
"7","Leonard: Got you a little something, too."
"7","Penny: Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?"
"7","Leonard: It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it."
"7","Penny: Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever."
"7","Leonard: Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go."
"7","Penny: Should we take this little party to the bedroom?"
"7","Leonard: Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves."
"7","Penny: Oh, that’s true."
"7","Leonard: In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot."
"7","Penny: That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me."
"7","Leonard: To the bedroom."
"7","Scene: The dining car."
"7","Waiter: And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?"
"7","Sheldon: Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
"7","Waiter: I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
"7","Amy: Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute."
"7","Man in seat behind: Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle."
"7","Sheldon: Get out of town."
"7","Howard: Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train."
"7","Leonard: Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God."
"7","Leonard: It’s a little late, but I’ll take it."
"7","Penny: No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs."
"7","Leonard: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?"
"7","Penny: We gotta get her to a vet right now."
"7","Leonard: I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet."
"7","Penny: Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go."
"7","Leonard: Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch."
"7","Sheldon: Do another one, do another one."
"7","Man: Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh."
"7","Sheldon: It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I’ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo."
"7","Man: I’ve been on that train. And I just was again."
"7","Amy: See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud."
"7","Sheldon: How many trains have you been on?"
"7","Man: Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains."
"7","Sheldon: Wow. Your life’s amazing."
"7","Man: Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains."
"7","Amy: Why do I even try?"
"7","Bernadette: I’m gonna fix this right now."
"7","Howard: Okay. Just make it look like an accident."
"7","Bernadette: Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her."
"7","Sheldon: You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us."
"7","Man: All right."
"7","Bernadette: Great. Now there’s two of ’em."
"7","Scene: A vet’s surgery."
"7","Lady Vet: How much chocolate did she eat?"
"7","Penny: A whole box."
"7","Leonard: Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me."
"7","Penny: So the point is I may have saved her life."
"7","Vet: I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?"
"7","Leonard: No. Maybe to her."
"7","Vet: How big a box of chocolate was it?"
"7","Penny: Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas."
"7","Leonard: Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?"
"7","Penny: Do you know how much gas is?"
"7","Vet: Hey."
"7","Penny: Sorry."
"7","Leonard: Sorry."
"7","Raj: Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts."
"7","Vet: You’re the owner?"
"7","Raj: Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare."
"7","Vet: Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins."
"7","Raj: Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up."
"7","Vet: Got it. Should have been a dentist."
"7","Man: Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?"
"7","Sheldon: Trick question. There never was one."
"7","Man: Or was there?"
"7","Sheldon: What?"
"7","Man: In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four."
"7","Sheldon: In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?"
"7","Howard: A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world."
"7","Man: Hold on to your conductor’s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made."
"7","Sheldon: I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?"
"7","Waiter: Better than you think."
"7","Man: You know, if you ask nicely, they’ll let you visit the engine room."
"7","Sheldon: I never want this day to end."
"7","Amy: It’s feeling like it never will."
"7","Sheldon: Come on."
"7","Man: Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?"
"7","Scene: The vets surgery."
"7","Raj: As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?"
"7","Penny: It wasn’t cheap. It was free."
"7","Leonard: We’re really sorry. It was an accident."
"7","Penny: Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long."
"7","Leonard: Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while."
"7","Raj: Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?"
"7","Vet: She’s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation."
"7","Raj: All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon."
"7","Vet: It’s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We’re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception."
"7","Raj: Thank you."
"7","Vet: Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry."
"7","Raj: Oh, yeah?"
"7","Vet: And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it."
"7","Penny: I think there’s something going on between the two of them."
"7","Leonard: Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?"
"7","Howard: You okay?"
"7","Amy: Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?"
"7","Howard: Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos."
"7","Amy: I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different."
"7","Bernadette: Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200"
"7","bucks it wasn’t gonna happen."
"7","Howard: I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2."
"7","Bernadette: See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots."
"7","Howard: She’s right."
"7","Bernadette: So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me."
"7","Howard: I had a little to do with it."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?"
"7","Howard: I am."
"7","Leonard: They’ve been in there, like, half an hour."
"7","Penny: Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while."
"7","Leonard: How long should we stay?"
"7","Penny: I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry."
"7","Leonard: I saw a Thai place next door."
"7","Penny: Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey."
"7","Leonard: How’s she doing?"
"7","Penny: How is everything?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah."
"7","Raj: She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home."
"7","Penny: Oh, good."
"7","Vet: So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don’t hesitate to call."
"7","Raj: Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl."
"7","Vet: My pleasure. Have a nice night."
"7","Leonard: Yes, thank you for all your help."
"7","Penny: Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals."
"7","Vet: Oh, do you guys own any pets?"
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Vet: Good."
"7","Howard: I love you so much."
"7","Bernadette: I love you, too."
"7","Howard: Sorry."
"7","Bernadette: Sorry."
"7","Man: You guys missed a pretty great time."
"7","Sheldon: The conductor and I have the same pocket watch."
"7","Man: It was crazy."
"7","Sheldon: Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us."
"7","Amy: Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now."
"7","Howard: There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?"
"7","Bernadette: Oh, that sounds so romantic."
"7","Amy: Oh, give it a rest."
"7","Bernadette: Let’s go."
"7","Amy: Why are you still here?"
"7","Sheldon: Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude."
"7","Amy: I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening."
"7","Sheldon: How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train."
"7","Man: I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?"
"7","Sheldon: I get it."
"7","Amy: Leave."
"7","Sheldon: What is your problem?"
"7","Amy: It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?"
"7","Amy: Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen."
"7","Sheldon: Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win."
"7","Amy: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic."
"7","Amy: That was nice."
"7","Sheldon: Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing."
"7","Amy: Okay, have fun."
"7","Sheldon: Do you want to come with me?"
"7","Amy: Really? I do."
"7","Man: Hey, guys, wait up."
"7","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"7","Raj: There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Leonard: Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?"
"7","Sheldon: It was wonderful."
"7","Leonard: Great. What did you do?"
"7","Sheldon: I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night."
"7","Leonard: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude."
"7","Leonard: No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?"
"7","Sheldon: Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite."
"7","Leonard: Well, give it a go."
"7","Sheldon: I can’t answer that without collecting additional data."
"7","Leonard: Additional data. You dog."
"7","Sheldon: I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right."

"7","Bernadette: Now I feel a little gross."
"7","Raj: You’re only making it seem more real for me."
"7","Howard: Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me."
"7","Raj: Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?"
"7","Sheldon: How about Penny’s depressing acting career?"
"7","Leonard: Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing."
"7","Penny: Aw, thank you."
"7","Howard: Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?"
"7","Raj: Is that a real book? I would totally read that book."
"7","Amy: Can I borrow it when you’re done?"
"7","Penny: Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week."
"7","Leonard: Why would you do that?"
"7","Penny: Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in."
"7","Bernadette: Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that."
"7","Sheldon: She does. 42 minutes in."
"7","Raj: While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters."
"7","Sheldon: I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is."
"7","Penny: Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet."
"7","Sheldon: Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?"

"7","Leonard: Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?"
"7","Penny: Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”"
"7","Raj: If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong."
"7","Leonard: I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing."
"7","Amy: I think we’re gonna go."
"7","Sheldon: Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s."
"7","Howard: Hey, I work at the same university you do."
"7","Sheldon: Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye."
"7","Bernadette: Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?"
"7","Penny: Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices."
"7","Leonard: No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight."
"7","Sheldon: Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it."
"7","Howard: I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here."
"7","Sheldon: I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman."
"7","Raj: Ha-a-a. Still funny."
"7","Bernadette: That was ten years ago."
"7","Sheldon: Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over."
"7","Amy: Really?"
"7","Howard: The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny."
"7","Raj: I was there. It was funny."
"7","Sheldon: In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth."
"7","Scene: The street"
"7","Amy: Thanks for walking me to my car."
"7","Raj: Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs."
"7","Amy: Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues."
"7","Raj: I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it."
"7","Amy: Whatever happened with your online dating?"
"7","Raj: No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile."
"7","Amy: Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact."
"7","Raj: It has been a while since I got my prostate checked."
"7","Amy: Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now."
"7","Raj: What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years."
"7","Amy: That’s true. Do whatever you want."
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s office."
"7","Howard: Hey."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Howard: Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends."
"7","Sheldon: Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much."
"7","Howard: Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off."
"7","Sheldon: Very well. How do you propose we move forward?"
"7","Howard: Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other."
"7","Sheldon: That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it."
"7","Howard: Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre."
"7","Sheldon: I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?"
"7","Howard: No."
"7","Sheldon: I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming."
"7","Scene: Amy’s lab."
"7","Raj: Amy, I could use some help."
"7","Amy: Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain."
"7","Raj: I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing."
"7","Amy: Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa."
"7","Raj: And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman."
"7","Amy: Great, so what do you need me for?"
"7","Raj: Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first."
"7","Amy: All right."
"7","Raj: Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower."
"7","Amy: Wow."
"7","Raj: I know. Powerful stuff, huh?"
"7","Amy: No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy."
"7","Raj: Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here."
"7","Amy: Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”"
"7","Raj: Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me."
"7","Amy: I’m not gonna pretend to be you."
"7","Raj: I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up."
"7","Amy: Well, what would I say to her?"
"7","Raj: Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words."
"7","Scene: Penny’s car."
"7","Sheldon: Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy."
"7","Penny: Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America."
"7","Penny: Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good."
"7","Sheldon: Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?"
"7","Penny: Yes."
"7","Sheldon: Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…"
"7","Penny: Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now."
"7","Sheldon: Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out."
"7","Leonard: Are we playing individual or teams?"
"7","Raj: Teams are fun."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard."
"7","Raj: But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…"
"7","Howard: I really don’t think we do tha…"
"7","Raj: Do that. See?"
"7","Penny: Oh, hi."
"7","Leonard: Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?"
"7","Penny: Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah, sure."
"7","Raj: Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?"
"7","Howard: Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…"
"7","Raj: Plane tickets? Yeah."
"7","Howard: Will you please sto…"
"7","Raj: Stop that? Okay."
"7","Scene: The stairwell."
"7","Penny: I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can’t drive to auditions."
"7","Leonard: I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?"
"7","Penny: I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her."
"7","Leonard: At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go."
"7","Penny: How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life."
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you."
"7","Penny: I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?"
"7","Sheldon: It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood."
"7","Raj: Hey, you busy?"
"7","Amy: No. What’s up?"
"7","Raj: Have you heard back from Emily?"
"7","Amy: I have."
"7","Raj: Great. And?"
"7","Amy: And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her."
"7","Raj: I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it."
"7","Amy: I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive."
"7","Raj: I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second."
"7","Amy: Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night."
"7","Raj: What’s happening tomorrow night?"
"7","Amy: I’m meeting her for coffee."
"7","Raj: What?"
"7","Amy: Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off."
"7","Raj: I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?"
"7","Amy: No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting."
"7","Raj: Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart."
"7","Scene: Bernadette’s car."
"7","Howard: That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute."
"7","Bernadette: What are you doing?"
"7","Howard: Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car."
"7","Bernadette: This is gonna be a long weekend for you."
"7","Howard: You’re the reason I’m doing it."
"7","Bernadette: I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway."
"7","Howard: How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts."
"7","Bernadette: Hi."
"7","Howard: Hey, buddy."
"7","Bernadette: You excited for Texas?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, very much so."
"7","Howard: It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, who’s the real astronaut?"
"7","Howard: Buzz Aldrin."
"7","Sheldon: Oh. Yay."
"7","Scene: An airplane."
"7","Sheldon: (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard?"
"7","(Tap, tap, tap)"
"7","Howard: What now?"
"7","Sheldon: I have to go to the bathroom."
"7","Howard: You just went to the bathroom."
"7","Sheldon: But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt."
"7","Howard: Well, it still doesn’t."
"7","Sheldon: I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago."
"7","Howard: Fine."
"7","Sheldon: Why are you getting annoyed?"
"7","Howard: I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things."
"7","Sheldon: Like when?"
"7","Howard: When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous."
"7","Sheldon: Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me."
"7","Howard: Thank you."
"7","Sheldon: Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?"
"7","Sheldon: But I still need to use the bathroom."
"7","Howard: Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?"
"7","Sheldon: No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are."
"7","Howard: Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one."
"7","Sheldon: I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!"
"7","Howard: I’m gonna need that bag back."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Leonard: You sure you want to do this?"
"7","Penny: Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with."
"7","Leonard: Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood."
"7","Penny: I know. Thank you."
"7","Leonard: Sorry."
"7","Penny: It’s just so humiliating."
"7","Leonard: So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop."
"7","Scene: Outside the building."
"7","Leonard: Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great."
"7","Penny: Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car."
"7","Leonard: I know. I thought we’d take yours."
"7","Penny: I don’t understand."
"7","Leonard: It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing."
"7","Penny: I don’t know what to say."
"7","Leonard: Don’t say anything."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God."
"7","Leonard: I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car."
"7","Scene: A coffee shop."
"7","Amy: Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty."
"7","Raj: Hello, Emily."
"7","Emily: Hello."
"7","Raj: Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?"
"7","Emily: No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might."
"7","Raj: Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing."
"7","Emily: I’m leaving."
"7","Amy: Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?"
"7","Emily: You know, I think I’m just gonna go by myself."
"7","Raj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either."
"7","Scene: The airplane."
"7","Sheldon: I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you."
"7","Howard: I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault."
"7","Sheldon: If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life."
"7","Howard: Thank you, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big."
"7","Announcement: The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You’re now free to move about the cabin."
"7","Howard: It’s over."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah."
"7","Howard: Should we stop holding hands now?"
"7","Sheldon: In a minute."
"7","Howard: Okay, good."
"7","Series 07 Episode 18 – The Mommy Observation"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Amy: Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?"
"7","Raj: He’s in Texas, he’ll never know."
"7","Penny: I wouldn’t be so sure about that."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up."
"7","Raj: Have you heard from Howard?"
"7","Bernadette: I did. His talk at NASA went great."
"7","Penny: Sheldon didn’t heckle him?"
"7","Bernadette: No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream."
"7","Stuart: Hey, guys."
"7","Amy: Oh, hi."
"7","Bernadette: Hi, Stuart."
"7","Raj: Hey, Stuart!"
"7","Stuart: How’s it going?"
"7","Raj: Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like."
"7","Stuart: Oh, how is it?"
"7","Penny: Disgusting. Do not tell him."
"7","Leonard: What do you guys want to do tonight?"
"7","Amy: I don’t know."
"7","Bernadette: Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something."
"7","Raj: Stuart? Are you okay?"
"7","Stuart: No, I don’t feel so…"
"7","Leonard: Oh, my God, Stuart?"
"7","Penny: Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!"
"7","Raj: Stuart?"
"7","Leonard: Calling 911."
"7","Raj: Well, it’s too late."
"7","Leonard: What do you mean it’s too late?"
"7","Raj: He’s been murdered by someone in this room."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God."
"7","Leonard: Oh, come on."
"7","Raj: Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner."
"7","Amy: I’m leaving."
"7","Raj: You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom."
"7","Bernadette: I didn’t know his last name was Bloom."
"7","Amy: Yeah, it’s Bloom."
"7","Penny: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?"
"7","Stuart: What do you think I was gonna do at home?"
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Penny: Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?"
"7","Raj: Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?"
"7","Penny: You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun."
"7","Raj: Thank you."
"7","Penny: That kind of actress. This sucks."
"7","Leonard: Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great."
"7","Amy: I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight."
"7","Raj: Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves."
"7","Amy: Oh, ugh."
"7","Bernadette: All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?"
"7","Raj: Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi."
"7","Bernadette: What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?"
"7","Raj: Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?"
"7","Amy: According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first."
"7","Raj: Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues."
"7","Penny: Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?"
"7","Raj: Any question but that."
"7","Penny: Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?"
"7","Stuart: Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?"
"7","Bernadette: What do you care? You’re dead."
"7","Stuart: Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt."
"7","Scene: A hire car."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you for my bobble head."
"7","Howard: Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech."
"7","Sheldon: It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?"
"7","Howard: We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something."
"7","Sheldon: I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge."
"7","Howard: Oh, boy."
"7","Sheldon: Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later."
"7","Howard: I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful."
"7","Bernadette: So, what happens next?"
"7","Raj: I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment."
"7","Penny: Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer."
"7","Amy: Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase."
"7","Leonard: Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system."
"7","Raj: Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun."
"7","Penny: Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?"
"7","Raj: Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends."
"7","Bernadette: I didn’t know you were fat."
"7","Raj: Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them."
"7","Amy: That is so sweet."
"7","Leonard: I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid."
"7","Raj: No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling."
"7","Bernadette: Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt."
"7","Amy: What’s it for?"
"7","Bernadette: For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now."
"7","Raj: From the future? How fun and imaginative."
"7","Leonard: So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?"
"7","Raj: Correct."
"7","Leonard: Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?"
"7","Raj: Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?"
"7","Penny: I’m gonna need another clue."
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s childhood home."
"7","Howard: Okay, give me the flowers and pie."
"7","Sheldon: But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you."
"7","Howard: They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough."
"7","Sheldon: Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now."
"7","Howard: What’s wrong?"
"7","Sheldon: Nothing."
"7","Howard: What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on."
"7","Sheldon: I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again."
"7","Scene: A bar in Texas."
"7","Howard: You ready to talk about it?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?"
"7","Howard: Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?"
"7","Sheldon: No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?"
"7","Howard: Well, did she see you in the window?"
"7","Sheldon: No."
"7","Howard: Then don’t say anything."
"7","Sheldon: I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?"
"7","Howard: Well, don’t do it on the phone."
"7","Sheldon: No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho."
"7","Howard: That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip."
"7","Howard: Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business."
"7","Sheldon: I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote."
"7","Raj: Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored."
"7","Penny: Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great."
"7","Stuart: Hey, can I go to the bathroom?"
"7","Raj: Fine, just try not to look too alive."
"7","Stuart: That’s my jam."
"7","Bernadette: So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?"
"7","Amy: But why?"
"7","Raj: Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue."
"7","Amy: Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea."
"7","Penny: Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London."
"7","Leonard: Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford."
"7","Penny: Hmm."
"7","Bernadette: So I guess you two are making it work long distance."
"7","Raj: Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna."
"7","Amy: What does your card say, Bernadette?"
"7","Leonard: Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?"
"7","Penny: Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me."
"7","Leonard: But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up."
"7","Penny: Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money."
"7","Leonard: Well, you don’t go into science for the money."
"7","Bernadette: Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps."
"7","Penny: So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?"
"7","Amy: Dun, dun, dun. He started it."
"7","Raj: Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids."
"7","Leonard: Great."
"7","Penny: Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?"
"7","Sheldon: Okay, let’s do this."
"7","Howard: Good luck."
"7","Sheldon: You, aren’t you gonna come with me?"
"7","Howard: While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps."
"7","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?"
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here."
"7","Sheldon: I saw you having naked sex."
"7","Mrs Cooper: What are you talking about?"
"7","Sheldon: Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man."
"7","Mrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this."
"7","Sheldon: Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?"
"7","Mrs Cooper: That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions."
"7","Sheldon: Who was he?"
"7","Mrs Cooper: His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group."
"7","Sheldon: How long have you been involved with him?"
"7","Mrs Cooper: A few months."
"7","Sheldon: And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"
"7","Mrs Cooper: That is no way to speak to your mother."
"7","Sheldon: Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas."
"7","Mrs Cooper: I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize."
"7","Sheldon: Or what?"
"7","Mrs Cooper: Or I will send you to your room."
"7","Sheldon: That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground."
"7","Mrs Cooper: Go to your room."
"7","Sheldon: But I occupy the moral high ground."
"7","Sheldon: But I’m a professional scientist."
"7","Mrs: Go to your room!"
"7","Sheldon: I’m a grown man."
"7","Raj: Can we please get back to the game?"
"7","Leonard: In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science."
"7","Penny: Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are."
"7","Amy: I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff."
"7","Leonard: Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?"
"7","Amy: Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard."
"7","Penny: In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?"
"7","Stuart: I think you and Leonard will be together."
"7","Penny: You do?"
"7","Stuart: Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know."
"7","Leonard: Aw."
"7","Penny: That’s so sweet."
"7","Bernadette: What the hell?"
"7","Amy: Excuse me?"
"7","Penny: Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?"
"7","Stuart: Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person."
"7","Penny: Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you."
"7","Raj: Oh, come on."
"7","Bernadette: Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses."
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s old bedroom."
"7","Howard: Hey, can I come in?"
"7","Sheldon: Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car."
"7","Howard: That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom."
"7","Sheldon: No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this."
"7","Howard: You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself."
"7","Sheldon: Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe."
"7","Howard: I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left."
"7","Sheldon: I didn’t know she did."
"7","Howard: Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it."
"7","Sheldon: What did you do?"
"7","Howard: Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why."
"7","Sheldon: I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why."
"7","Howard: All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness."
"7","Sheldon: You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel."
"7","Howard: And the healing begins."
"7","Scene: Mrs Cooper’s living room."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Mrs Cooper: Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?"
"7","Sheldon: I am."
"7","Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you."
"7","Sheldon: I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?"
"7","Mrs Cooper: You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days."
"7","Sheldon: Then why are you doing it?"
"7","Mrs Cooper: Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is."
"7","Sheldon: Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance."
"7","Mrs Cooper: That is very Christian of you."
"7","Sheldon: Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore."
"7","Mrs Cooper: How old do you think I am?"
"7","Sheldon: My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex."
"7","Mrs Cooper: Are you having the sex talk with me?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, someone has to."
"7","Mrs Cooper: Oh, dear Lord."
"7","Sheldon: No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now."
"7","Penny: Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game."
"7","Raj: I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout."
"7","Amy: It actually was kind of fun."
"7","Raj: You’re just saying that."
"7","Amy: Yeah."
"7","Bernadette: I liked the time travel element."
"7","Raj: Thank you. I thought it was inspired."
"7","Leonard: It was. By Terminator."
"7","Bernadette: Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends."
"7","Penny: Definitely."
"7","Leonard: Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do."
"7","Bernadette: Aw."
"7","Penny: I love it."
"7","Leonard: Putting it in my phone right now."
"7","Penny: Yeah, me, too."
"7","Stuart: My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand."
"7","Raj: And it’s done."
"7","Penny: Yup, we’re all in."
"7","Leonard: All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years."
"7","Scene: In front of the building, 20 years later."
"7","Stuart: I knew it."
"7","Series 07 Episode 19 – The Indecision Amalgamation"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Sheldon: Boy, do I have to urinate."
"7","Leonard: If only there were a solution to that."
"7","Sheldon: Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis."
"7","Leonard: So go to the bathroom."
"7","Sheldon: I can’t."
"7","Leonard: Why not?"
"7","Sheldon: Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?"
"7","Leonard: Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions."
"7","Leonard: Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?"
"7","Penny: Hi."
"7","Leonard: Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?"
"7","Penny: I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot."
"7","Leonard: Oh, that’s great."
"7","Penny: I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks."
"7","Sheldon: Here come the waterworks."
"7","Leonard: Aren’t you gonna ask?"
"7","Penny: What is this, my first day?"
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Bernadette: Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?"
"7","Penny: Yeah, sure."
"7","Amy: Of course."
"7","Bernadette: Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell."
"7","Amy: I’m sure it’s lovable."
"7","Penny: I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?"
"7","Bernadette: Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign."
"7","Amy: Okay."
"7","Bernadette: But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card."
"7","Penny: I’m liking my odds here."
"7","Bernadette: So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”"
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Bernadette: “LOL.” Smiley face."
"7","Amy: Oh, my gosh."
"7","Bernadette: “P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”"
"7","Penny: Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this? (Phone rings) Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?"
"7","(Phone rings)"
"7","Bernadette: Am I a terrible person?"
"7","Amy: No. No, it was a mistake."
"7","Bernadette: Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?"
"7","Amy: Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?"
"7","Penny: No, I didn’t get it."
"7","Bernadette: I’m so sorry."
"7","Amy: You’ll get offered something soon."
"7","Penny: I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine if I want it."
"7","Bernadette: Are you gonna take it?"
"7","Penny: I don’t know what to do."
"7","Amy: Maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?"
"7","Scene: A coffee shop."
"7","Raj: Hey. Emily, right?"
"7","Emily: Yeah."
"7","Raj: I, I don’t know if you remember me."
"7","Emily: From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?"
"7","Raj: Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it."
"7","Emily: Uh, don’t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you’re not the weirdest guy I’ve met off the Internet."
"7","Raj: Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me."
"7","Emily: All right, here’s your chance."
"7","Raj: Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile."
"7","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"7","Sheldon: So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it."
"7","Amy: Can you get the butter, please?"
"7","Sheldon: You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard."
"7","Amy: Then get the other one. Pass the butter."
"7","Sheldon: Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously."
"7","Amy: Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention."
"7","Sheldon: Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking."
"7","Amy: No way."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating."
"7","Amy: Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat."
"7","Sheldon: No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included."
"7","Amy: Included?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory."
"7","Amy: Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?"
"7","Sheldon: See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer."
"7","Amy: Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who’s they?"
"7","Sheldon: Xbox."
"7","Amy: You’re kidding."
"7","Sheldon: No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types."
"7","Amy: This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?"
"7","Sheldon You see? I don’t know. What should I do?"
"7","Amy: Please pass the butter!"
"7","Penny: Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible."
"7","Leonard: Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie."
"7","Penny: Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?"
"7","(Reading)"
"7","Leonard: Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas."
"7","Penny: No, come on. This is serious."
"7","Leonard: Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?"
"7","Penny: Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Leonard: What does your agent think?"
"7","Penny: She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory."
"7","Leonard: You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?"
"7","Penny: Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini."
"7","Leonard: Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?"
"7","Penny: Both of us."
"7","Leonard: So it’s a family film."
"7","Sheldon: Thank you again for dinner."
"7","Amy: You’re welcome."
"7","Sheldon: Good night."
"7","Amy: Uh, it’s date night. Aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, of course. (They kiss) Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?"
"7","(They kiss)"
"7","Amy: No."
"7","Sheldon: Well, they do."
"7","Raj: And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet."
"7","Leonard: So, are you gonna see her again?"
"7","Raj: Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her."
"7","Penny: Okay, like what? Show me."
"7","Raj: I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff."
"7","Leonard: You have my blessing. Go for it."
"7","Raj: Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way."
"7","Penny: Oh, that’s sad."
"7","Raj: It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion."
"7","Penny: Wow."
"7","Leonard: Okay, that’s enough."
"7","Sheldon: Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?"
"7","Raj: Uh, Xbox One."
"7","Sheldon: Penny?"
"7","Penny: Huh?"
"7","Sheldon: Leonard?"
"7","Leonard: PS4."
"7","Sheldon: Wolowitz?"
"7","Howard: Both great."
"7","Sheldon: Bernadette?"
"7","Bernadette: I like the Wii."
"7","Sheldon: Thanks, Grandma."
"7","Raj: Oh, my goodness."
"7","Leonard: What’s up?"
"7","Raj: I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together."
"7","Leonard: Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa."
"7","Penny: Really?"
"7","Leonard: Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa."
"7","Scene: The same, later."
"7","Raj: What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?"
"7","Howard: Why do you have to choose? Date both of them."
"7","Raj: I can’t date two women at once. Zero women, that’s my sweet spot."
"7","Penny: Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal."
"7","Raj: But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?"
"7","Howard and Bernadette (together): Yes."
"7","(together)"
"7","Bernadette: What do you mean, yes?"
"7","Howard: What do you mean, yes?"
"7","Bernadette: Were you seeing other women when we started dating?"
"7","Howard: No. Were you seeing other men?"
"7","Bernadette: No."
"7","Leonard: Were you seeing other men?"
"7","Leonard: Aren’t you gonna ask me?"
"7","Penny: Come on, really?"
"7","Leonard: Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain."
"7","Wil Wheaton: Yeah, happy to help. So, what’s going on?"
"7","Penny: Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I should take it."
"7","Wil: Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I’ve been embarrassed by."
"7","Penny: I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing."
"7","Wil: I wasn’t."
"7","Penny: Me, either."
"7","Leonard: So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?"
"7","Wil: Well, it’s tricky. You want to take projects that you’re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you’re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek."
"7","Penny: Yeah, beam me up. I love it."
"7","Wil: Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing."
"7","Penny: That’s what I’m afraid of."
"7","Wil: So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels."
"7","Leonard: Sounds rough."
"7","Wil: I’m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don’t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can’t even get out of bed."
"7","Leonard: Okay, this was helpful."
"7","Scene: The stairwell."
"7","Raj: Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?"
"7","Bernadette: Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition."
"7","Raj: Oh, no."
"7","Bernadette: The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings."
"7","Howard: Were you like this when I married you?"
"7","Leonard (on phone): Don’t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he’s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he’s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle."
"7","(on phone)"
"7","Raj: Did he help you make a decision about the movie?"
"7","Penny: No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?"
"7","Raj: As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes."
"7","Howard: He’s gonna die alone, right?"
"7","Leonard: Yes."
"7","Penny: Yes."
"7","Bernadette: Yes."
"7","Scene: An electrical store."
"7","Amy: I’m proud of you, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: You know, I’m proud of me, too. I’ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice."
"7","Amy: Well, that’s got to be a good feeling."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, it is. Although."
"7","Amy: Oh, crap."
"7","Sheldon: I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS."
"7","Amy: You were just a little kid."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray."
"7","Amy: How old were you then?"
"7","Sheldon: Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune."
"7","Amy: What’s a Zune?"
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox."
"7","Amy: No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it’s good. You did the research."
"7","Sheldon: But what if I’m wrong?"
"7","Amy: You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?"
"7","Sheldon: You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre."
"7","Amy: Then I’ll buy you a new entertainment centre."
"7","Sheldon: Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?"
"7","Amy: How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome."
"7","Sheldon: Interesting."
"7","Amy: So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One."
"7","Sheldon: All right, I’ll try."
"7","Amy: What is it?"
"7","Sheldon: A quarter."
"7","Amy: Could have given it back to me. That was a choice."
"7","Scene: A restaurant."
"7","Raj: You look, you look really pretty tonight."
"7","Emily: Thanks. I love that jacket."
"7","Raj: Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I’m seeing her Saturday, And I’m glad you like it, it’s from J. Crew."
"7","Emily: I don’t understand."
"7","Raj: My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I’m being deceitful."
"7","Emily: Are you getting back together with her?"
"7","Raj: No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?"
"7","Emily: Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let’s do this. How serious were you two?"
"7","Raj: Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo."
"7","Emily: Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?"
"7","Raj: Yeah."
"7","Emily: That’s kind of adorable."
"7","Raj: Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves."
"7","Emily: I’m still here."
"7","Raj: Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you."
"7","Emily: We just met. You don’t need to tell me about other people you’re seeing."
"7","Raj: Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself."
"7","Scene: The electrical store."
"7","Sheldon: On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?"
"7","Amy: I can’t feel my legs."
"7","Store assistant: Oh, I’m sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago."
"7","Sheldon: But I haven’t decided yet."
"7","Store assistant: You’ll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed."
"7","Amy: Let’s get you some food. You, You’ll feel better after you eat."
"7","Sheldon: Okay."
"7","Amy: What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?"
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know. Hey, look, a quarter."
"7","Scene: A film set. Penny is being fitted with gorilla hands."
"7","Costume guy: How’s that feel?"
"7","Penny: Great. Not like regret at all."
"7","Wil: Penny? We’re working together. Awesome."

"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Leonard: I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get."
"7","Raj: I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star."
"7","Howard: Only without the sex."
"7","Raj: Yeah, literally, none of it."
"7","Leonard: What do you think about it, Sheldon?"
"7","Sheldon: Meh."
"7","Raj: Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?"
"7","Sheldon: Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, my God, you’re jealous."
"7","Sheldon: Why would I be jealous?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television."
"7","Barry: Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider."
"7","Sheldon: Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?"
"7","Barry: No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything."
"7","Sheldon: Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well."
"7","Barry: Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water."
"7","Sheldon: Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?"
"7","Howard: Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?"
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Penny: Hey, you’re up early."
"7","Sheldon: I couldn’t sleep."
"7","Penny: I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea."
"7","Sheldon: No, that’s not it."
"7","Penny: Is something bothering you?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes, but you wouldn’t understand."
"7","Penny: Oh, come on, try me."
"7","Sheldon: All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool."
"7","Penny: Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it."
"7","Sheldon: You mean your acting career?"
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Sheldon: Your relationship with Leonard?"
"7","Sheldon: Your failed attempt to go back to college?"
"7","Penny: No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want."
"7","Sheldon: I said Leonard, you said no."
"7","Penny: I’m talking about other guys."
"7","Sheldon: Okay. Well, what do you do?"
"7","Penny: You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know if I can do that."
"7","Penny: I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow."
"7","Leonard: Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?"
"7","Sheldon: Break it off, shake hands, walk away."
"7","Leonard: Hey, how’s dating two women going?"
"7","Raj: Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy."
"7","Howard: And?"
"7","Raj: She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you"
"7","be more like Emily? Those feelings became less mixed."
"7","Leonard: Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?"
"7","Raj: At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl."
"7","Howard: I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible."
"7","Raj: Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere."
"7","Howard: She is. But I like that attitude."
"7","Sheldon: Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?"
"7","Raj: You’re really going to do this?"
"7","Sheldon: I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship."
"7","Howard: You’re reading Cosmo?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas."
"7","Howard: What’s this?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface."
"7","Leonard: Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?"
"7","Sheldon: It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places."
"7","Raj: It’s going to be okay."
"7","Sheldon: I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too."
"7","Howard: So, you and Emily still together?"
"7","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"7","Howard: I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night."
"7","Raj: Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily."
"7","Howard: Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?"
"7","Raj: She’s very real."
"7","Howard: Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe."
"7","Raj: See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her."
"7","Howard: I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour."
"7","Raj: You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog."
"7","Howard: You got it."
"7","Raj: No jokes about the year I took ballet."
"7","Howard: You took ballet?"
"7","Raj: God, you never listen."
"7","Leonard: Are you sure you want to do this?"
"7","Sheldon: The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look."
"7","Leonard: What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?"
"7","Penny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll): Oh my God, I do look like that."
"7","(treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll)"
"7","Sheldon: You stop it."
"7","Penny: So, how do you want me to cut it?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?"
"7","Leonard: So, business in the front, science in the back."
"7","Penny: Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS."
"7","Penny: Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?"
"7","Leonard: That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter."
"7","Penny: Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it."
"7","Sheldon: Don’t feel bad. Neither does he."
"7","Penny: Okay, what do you think?"
"7","Sheldon: Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?"
"7","Leonard: It actually looks good, Sheldon."
"7","Penny: Doesn’t it?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah."
"7","Sheldon: I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one."
"7","Amy: Sorry I’m late. What did you do?"
"7","Penny: I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?"
"7","Amy: Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick."
"7","Sheldon: She’s right. I’m too hot."
"7","Scene: A restaurant."
"7","Bernadette: I’m excited to meet Emily."
"7","Howard: Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it."
"7","Bernadette: Why would you say that?"
"7","Howard: Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl."
"7","Bernadette: How?"
"7","Howard: In a bad way, very bad."
"7","Raj: Hey, guys."
"7","Howard: Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey."
"7","Raj: Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily."
"7","Emily: Nice to meet you."
"7","Bernadette: Hi."
"7","Emily: Have we met before?"
"7","Howard: Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so."
"7","Emily: You sure? You look familiar."
"7","Howard: Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van."
"7","Emily: Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?"
"7","Howard: That must be it."
"7","Raj: Since when do you go to spin class?"
"7","Howard: Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?"
"7","Amy: Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?"
"7","Penny: Wait. What’s wrong with geology?"
"7","Sheldon: Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science."
"7","Sheldon: Have you considered studying standard model physics?"
"7","Sheldon: You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?"
"7","Penny: Like you could get a brown bear."
"7","Leonard: Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know."
"7","Amy: Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp."
"7","Leonard: What about loop quantum gravity?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy."
"7","Penny: Who’s the duchess?"
"7","Leonard: One of the people that lives in his head."
"7","Amy: I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me."
"7","Leonard: Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend."
"7","Penny: Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you."
"7","Sheldon: That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day."
"7","Amy: How does that happen?"
"7","Sheldon: A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find."
"7","Penny: Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?"
"7","Sheldon: Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?"
"7","Penny: And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!"
"7","Scene: The restaurant."
"7","Bernadette: Emily, what do you do?"
"7","Emily: I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital."
"7","Raj: Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever."
"7","Emily: This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere."
"7","Raj: Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him."
"7","Emily: Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?"
"7","Howard: It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…"
"7","Emily: Oh, my God, I remember."
"7","Howard: Can I finish my astronaut story?"
"7","Emily: It was four years ago."
"7","Howard: Please don’t say it."
"7","Emily: We were set up on a blind date."
"7","Emily: You came to my apartment."
"7","Howard: You’re saying it."
"7","Raj: Wh, what happened?"
"7","Bernadette: Yeah, what happened?"
"7","Howard: Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom."
"7","Bernadette: Please don’t say it."
"7","Howard: One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again."
"7","Emily: You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit."
"7","Howard: I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere."
"7","Emily: Right, just water."
"7","Howard: Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am."
"7","Emily: It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla."
"7","Raj: Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!"
"7","Howard: Yeah, yeah, I get it."
"7","Bernadette: Howie."
"7","Howard: Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you."
"7","Amy: Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink."
"7","Sheldon: No more than Penny."
"7","Amy: That’s what I’m saying."
"7","Sheldon: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out."
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Bernadette: So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?"
"7","Emily: I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal."
"7","Bernadette: You’re kidding, right?"
"7","Raj: She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary."
"7","Howard: Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on."
"7","Bernadette: Howie, we moved on a long time ago."
"7","Howard: I’m just saying…"
"7","Bernadette: We moved on."
"7","Howard: Okay. Fine."
"7","Bernadette: How’s your soup?"
"7","Howard: Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me."
"7","Bernadette: Where are you going?"
"7","Howard: I need some fresh air."
"7","Emily: Been there."
"7","Scene: Sheldon, waking up in bed next to a Geology book."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no. What have I done?"
"7","Leonard: How you feeling?"
"7","Sheldon: Not so good."
"7","Leonard: Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?"
"7","Sheldon: It’s not my friend. Nothing happened."
"7","Leonard: I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?"
"7","Leonard: After she put you to bed, she went home."
"7","Sheldon: Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no."
"7","Leonard: What?"
"7","Sheldon: Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night."
"7","Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office."
"7","Answerphone: First new message."
"7","Sheldon (voice): Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad."
"7","(voice)"
"7","Scene: The cafeteria.."
"7","Howard: You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?"
"7","Sheldon: Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening."
"7","Howard: Ugh. Me, too. What happened?"
"7","Sheldon: I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking."
"7","Howard: I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?"
"7","Howard: Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass."
"7","Barry: Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic."
"7","Howard: Get out of here, Barry."
"7","Barry: Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa."
"7","Sheldon: Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass."
"7","Answerphone: Next message."
"7","Sheldon (voice): It’s me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together."
"7","Sheldon (voice): Do you know what’s great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That’s fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode."
"7","Sheldon (voice): Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now."
"7","Sheldon (voice): Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I’m you. Get it?"
"7","Sheldon (voice): Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you’re mad at me. I’m so sorry. Beep bop boop bop."
"7","Sheldon (voice): Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That’s even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?"
"7","Stephen Hawking: What a jackass."
"7","Series 07 Episode 21 – The Anything Can Happen Recurrence"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Penny: So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body."
"7","Leonard: Okay."
"7","Penny: But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape."
"7","Leonard: It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story."
"7","Penny: Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there."
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, I could use your assistance."
"7","Leonard: Sure. What’s up?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?"
"7","Leonard: Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter."
"7","Sheldon: That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…"
"7","Penny: Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?"
"7","Leonard: Thank you."
"7","Penny: Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?"
"7","Sheldon: It is just so frustrating."
"7","Penny: ‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it."
"7","Leonard: Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?"
"7","Penny: Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?"
"7","Leonard: You made fun of us. Said it was stupid."
"7","Penny: Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?"
"7","Sheldon: All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday."
"7","Leonard: Great, what do you want to do?"
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know. What do you want to do?"
"7","Penny: I don’t know. What do you want to do?"
"7","Leonard: I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Sheldon: Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?"
"7","Leonard: What can we do that’s different?"
"7","Penny: What can we do that’s free?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, got it. We order a pizza."
"7","Penny: Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder."
"7","Sheldon: You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings."
"7","Penny: Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea."
"7","Leonard: You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant."
"7","Sheldon: Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?"
"7","Leonard: No."
"7","Sheldon: All right."
"7","Leonard: Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?"
"7","Penny: No. Bernadette’s working late."
"7","Sheldon: Amy’s sick."
"7","Leonard: Aw. What’s wrong with her?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands."
"7","Leonard: That’s not what I meant."
"7","Sheldon: Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?"
"7","Leonard: What ails her?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh. Who knows?"
"7","Penny: Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs."
"7","Scene: Howard’s mother’s house."
"7","Howard: Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out."
"7","Raj: No problem. How’s your mom feeling?"
"7","Howard: Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine."
"7","Raj: You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese."
"7","Howard: Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?"
"7","Raj: I was thinking we could watch a DVD."
"7","Howard: Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit."
"7","Raj: Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?"
"7","Howard: A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff."
"7","Raj: I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her."
"7","Howard: That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit."
"7","Raj: Uh, so, you’ll watch it?"
"7","Howard: Sure."
"7","Raj: You’re a good friend. I owe you one."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard. Help me get out of the tub."
"7","(off)"
"7","Raj: Not that one."
"7","Scene: The street."
"7","Sheldon: So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?"
"7","Penny: Yep."
"7","Sheldon: Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday."
"7","Leonard: Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?"
"7","Sheldon: Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science."
"7","Penny: What the hell? What? She’s not working late."
"7","Sheldon: And Amy doesn’t look sick."
"7","Penny: Why would they lie to us?"
"7","Sheldon: That’s a good question. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?"
"7","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"7","Raj: Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await."
"7","Howard: I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you."
"7","Raj: You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it."
"7","Howard: Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets."
"7","Raj: All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it."
"7","Howard: Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie."
"7","Scene: A bar."
"7","Penny: You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?"
"7","Sheldon: And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always."
"7","Amy: I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory."
"7","Bernadette: We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie."
"7","Amy: But none of that means we don’t love you."
"7","Penny: I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?"
"7","Leonard: I also love you."
"7","Penny: Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: Where are we going?"
"7","Penny: We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do."
"7","Sheldon: Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…"
"7","Penny: Shut up."
"7","Scene: A restaurant. Sheldon makes an “unsure” noise."
"7","Penny: What’s wrong?"
"7","Sheldon: I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco."
"7","Penny: It’s fusion."
"7","Sheldon: My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity."
"7","Penny: Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?"
"7","Sheldon: Not at all."
"7","Penny: Thank you."
"7","Sheldon: But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah."
"7","Penny: Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy."
"7","Sheldon: I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night."
"7","Raj: Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish."
"7","Howard: And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother."
"7","Raj: On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?"
"7","Howard: What difference does it make?"
"7","Raj: What do you mean?"
"7","Howard: Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her."
"7","Raj: I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture."
"7","Scene: The bar."
"7","Amy: I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?"
"7","Bernadette: I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon."
"7","Leonard: He’d probably give you homework."
"7","Amy: Did you lie to Howard about tonight?"
"7","Bernadette: Of course."
"7","Amy: And you don’t feel guilty about it?"
"7","Bernadette: Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice."
"7","Leonard: Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her."
"7","Bernadette: Oh, we know you don’t lie to her."
"7","Scene: The restaurant."
"7","Penny: Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these."
"7","Sheldon: Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch."
"7","Penny: Come on, open it. I bet it says something great."
"7","Sheldon: This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here."
"7","Penny: Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one."
"7","Sheldon: No, it’s not."
"7","Penny: How is that not good?"
"7","Sheldon: Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter."
"7","Penny: Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours."
"7","Sheldon: Have you ever paid for a meal?"
"7","Penny: Not with money. Read."
"7","Sheldon: Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you."
"7","Penny: Oh, try again."
"7","Howard: Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her."
"7","Raj: I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?"
"7","Howard: Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. (Phone rings) Hey, Penny. What’s up? No, Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me."
"7","(Phone rings)"
"7","Raj: What?"
"7","Howard: I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight."
"7","Scene: The street. Outside a psychic’s shop."
"7","Penny: Oh, I think I see our next stop."
"7","Sheldon: You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram."
"7","Penny: No, come on, tonight we are trying new things."
"7","Sheldon: Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire."
"7","Scene: Outside the bar."
"7","Bernadette (on phone): Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on."
"7","(on phone)"
"7","Leonard: You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?"
"7","Amy: I know, it’s weird, right?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah. We should do it more often."
"7","Amy: Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now."
"7","Leonard: (Phone text sound) Ah, it’s Penny."
"7","(Phone text sound)"
"7","Amy: Is she still mad?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her."
"7","Amy: A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo."
"7","Leonard: Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do."
"7","Amy: Because she has sex with you."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, she does."
"7","Amy: Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are."
"7","Leonard: Really?"
"7","Amy: I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him."
"7","Leonard: Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish."
"7","Amy: Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already."
"7","Leonard: Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too."
"7","Amy: Really? What did you do?"
"7","Leonard: Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know."
"7","Bernadette: I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet."
"7","Scene: The psychic shop."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence."
"7","Penny: All right, Sheldon, just ask your question."
"7","Sheldon: Okay, I just did. What was it?"
"7","Penny: Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be."
"7","Sheldon: For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie."
"7","Penny: Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored."
"7","Psychic: All right, why don’t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with."
"7","Sheldon: That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders."
"7","Psychic: Yes, you clearly are. But I’m seeing a specific woman that you’re in a romantic relationship with."
"7","Penny: Oh, oh, here we go."
"7","Psychic: Does she have dark hair?"
"7","Penny: Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire."
"7","Sheldon: The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time."
"7","Psychic: Does she work in a similar field to you?"
"7","Sheldon: Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg."
"7","Psychic: They’re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her."
"7","Penny: Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?"
"7","Psychic: He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus."
"7","Penny: Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness."
"7","Psychic: Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her."
"7","Sheldon: You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey."
"7","Penny: Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before."
"7","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"7","Raj: Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses."
"7","Emily: Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper."
"7","Raj: Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into."
"7","Emily: Okay."
"7","Raj: And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it."
"7","Emily: I wonder that, too."
"7","Raj: Then, why do you watch these things?"
"7","Emily: Can I tell you something without you judging me?"
"7","Raj: Sure."
"7","Emily: They kind of turn me on."
"7","Raj: And play."
"7","Sheldon: Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening."
"7","Amy: Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you."
"7","Sheldon: And how do you propose to do that? (Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl) Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re going with this."
"7","(Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl)"
"7","Series 07 Episode 22 – The Proton Transmogrification"
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Sheldon: Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans."
"7","Penny: What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?"
"7","Howard: No. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s Wookiee Life Day."
"7","Penny: So, when is it?"
"7","Leonard: Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth."
"7","Sheldon: Get it?"
"7","Raj: May the fourth be with you?"
"7","Leonard: May the force be with you. Get it?"
"7","Penny: Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. There is a knock on the door."
"7","Sheldon: Come in."
"7","Leonard: Hey, you got a second?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes. Actually, I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news."
"7","Sheldon: What is it?"
"7","Leonard: I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away."
"7","Sheldon: Professor Proton is dead?"
"7","Leonard: Sorry, buddy."
"7","Sheldon: What are you doing?"
"7","Leonard: Comforting you?"
"7","Sheldon: Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t."
"7","Leonard: Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday."
"7","Sheldon: But, that’s Star Wars Day."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you."
"7","Sheldon: I’m fine."
"7","Leonard: Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box."
"7","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"7","Professor Proton (on youtube): This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can’t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn’t that a hoot? We’ll be right back after I fire my writers. (Owl hoots) Oh, shut up."
"7","(on youtube)"
"7","(Owl hoots)"
"7","Amy: Watching your old friend?"
"7","Sheldon: Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life."
"7","Amy: Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I’m not going to the funeral."
"7","Amy: Why not?"
"7","Sheldon: All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned."
"7","Amy: Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?"
"7","Sheldon: Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time."
"7","Amy: And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?"
"7","Sheldon: If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight."
"7","Penny: Hey, guys."
"7","Raj: Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day."
"7","Penny: Okay."
"7","Raj: Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business."
"7","Penny: No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral."
"7","Howard: You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?"
"7","Raj: And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO."
"7","Penny: Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?"
"7","Raj: Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?"
"7","Sheldon: Uh, no, thank you."
"7","Howard: You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?"
"7","Penny: Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?"
"7","Penny: No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?"
"7","Sheldon: Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day."
"7","Leonard: He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?"
"7","Raj: Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road."
"7","Penny: Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now."
"7","Scene: Amy”s apartment."
"7","Amy: Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up."
"7","Bernadette: Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake."
"7","Amy: No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button."
"7","Bernadette: Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while."
"7","Amy: Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating."
"7","Bernadette: This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes."
"7","Amy: I wonder why that is."
"7","Scene: The funeral."
"7","Penny: I have a confession to make."
"7","Leonard: Hmm?"
"7","Penny: I’ve never been to a funeral before."
"7","Leonard: Really?"
"7","Penny: I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight."
"7","Penny: I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone."
"7","Leonard: I know."
"7","Penny: I feel like I want to cry."
"7","Leonard: Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead."
"7","Penny: I can’t do it with you staring at me."
"7","Leonard: Sorry."
"7","Penny: No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in."
"7","Leonard: I am not a crybaby."
"7","Penny: Toy Story 3?"
"7","Leonard: The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift."
"7","Penny: It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship."
"7","Leonard: I got your back."
"7","Penny: Yeah."
"7","Sheldon: Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace."
"7","Raj: Ugh, let’s get this over with."
"7","Howard: Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time."
"7","Sheldon: Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it."
"7","Raj: You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI."
"7","Howard: Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters."
"7","Sheldon: Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?"
"7","Raj: It was just a suggestion."
"7","Sheldon: Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast."
"7","Raj: Wow."
"7","Howard: I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard."
"7","Raj: Should we try to console him?"
"7","Howard: Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?"
"7","Raj: By staying here and watching the movie."
"7","Howard: That’s what good friends would do."
"7","Scene: Later."
"7","Howard: Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV."
"7","Raj: Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him."
"7","Howard: Me, too."
"7","Raj: Maybe we should see how he’s doing."
"7","Howard: Yeah."
"7","Raj: But after the cantina scene."
"7","Howard: Obviously."
"7","Scene: Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop."
"7","Sheldon: Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again."
"7","Arthur: You never heard it that time."
"7","Sheldon: Arthur. I thought you were dead."
"7","Arthur: I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years."
"7","Sheldon: Why are you here?"
"7","Arthur: I don’t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife."
"7","Sheldon: I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan."
"7","Arthur: I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?"
"7","Sheldon: Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form."
"7","Arthur: Well, that, that clears that up."
"7","Sheldon: You must be here to give me advice."
"7","Arthur: Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back."
"7","Sheldon: Those are your Jedi robes."
"7","Arthur: Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?"
"7","Sheldon: Be careful with that."
"7","Arthur: Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I’m, uh, I’m going to need a Band-Aid."
"7","Leonard: So, what did you think of your first funeral?"
"7","Penny: Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house."
"7","Penny: You think about dying?"
"7","Leonard: Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets."
"7","Penny: What would you regret?"
"7","Leonard: Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language."
"7","Penny: You know Klingon."
"7","Leonard: That’s true."
"7","Penny: No, I meant that as a regret."
"7","Leonard: I just thought of one more."
"7","Penny: What’s that?"
"7","Leonard: I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you."
"7","Penny: Well, it just wasn’t the right time."
"7","Leonard: Yeah."
"7","Penny: And this is also not the right time. Do not propose."
"7","Leonard: What?"
"7","Penny: I know that face. That’s your propose face."
"7","Leonard: I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one."
"7","Penny: What’s two to one?"
"7","Leonard: I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one."
"7","Penny: Oh, my. It’s not a contest."
"7","Leonard: I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing."
"7","Penny: Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah, I think I would."
"7","Penny: Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?"
"7","Leonard: Hmm."
"7","Penny: No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up."
"7","Leonard: It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets."
"7","Amy: Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?"
"7","Bernadette: No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it."
"7","Amy: I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science."
"7","Bernadette: Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller."
"7","Amy: That’s cute."
"7","Bernadette: Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?"
"7","Amy: Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts."
"7","Bernadette: Girl Sprouts?"
"7","Amy: My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore."
"7","Bernadette: How did that get you into science?"
"7","Amy: Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did."
"7","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"7","Leonard: On the one hand, if I say yes…"
"7","Penny: This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?"
"7","Leonard: Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?"
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Leonard: Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter."
"7","Penny: You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want."
"7","Leonard: Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you."
"7","Penny: Thank you."
"7","Leonard: Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…"
"7","Scene: Sheldon’s dream."
"7","Arthur: Where, where, where are we?"
"7","Sheldon: This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi."
"7","Arthur: Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida."
"7","Sheldon: When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?"
"7","Arthur: Um, always, get, get a prenup."
"7","Sheldon: That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here."
"7","Arthur: Well, why, why do you think I’m here?"
"7","Sheldon: I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing."
"7","Arthur: Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?"
"7","Sheldon: Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos."
"7","Arthur: Yeah, I’ve, I’ve outlived a few of my doctors, too."
"7","Sheldon: Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14."
"7","Arthur: I’m, I’m sorry about that."
"7","Sheldon: And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away."
"7","Arthur: Well, you know, it’s, it’s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you."
"7","Sheldon: But I do appreciate them."
"7","Arthur: Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)"
"7","(Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)"
"7","Leonard: Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m okay. How was the funeral?"
"7","Leonard: It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?"
"7","(Sheldon hugs him)"
"7","Sheldon: I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night."
"7","Sheldon: That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap."
"7","Howard: Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch."
"7","Leonard: At least they toned him down in the second one."
"7","Penny: Yeah, he is pretty stupid."
"7","Raj: Hey, we can say it. You can’t."
"7","Amy: Hey, guys."
"7","Bernadette: Happy Star Wars Day."
"7","Sheldon: Wow. A Death Star cake."
"7","Amy: Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up."
"7","Bernadette: And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun."
"7","Howard: Well, you didn’t miss anything. We just started over."
"7","Bernadette: Son of a bitch."
"7","Scene: The same, everyone is falling asleep."
"7","Sheldon: You’re back."
"7","Arthur: Yeah, apparently, um, I’m here whenever, when, whenever you need me."
"7","Sheldon: That’s nice."
"7","Arthur: May, maybe for you."
"7","Sheldon: Why do I need you now?"
"7","Arthur: Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you’re, you’re dreaming you’re watching Star Wars."
"7","Sheldon: So?"
"7","Arthur: I mean, don’t, don’t you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you’re spending your limited time on Earth?"
"7","Sheldon: Not at all."
"7","Arthur: Okay, good luck to you."
"7","Series 07 Episode 23 – The Gorilla Dissolution"
"7","Scene: The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"7","Bernadette: Almost there. You’re doing great."
"7","Howard: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box."
"7","Raj: Please hurry."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t need a treadmill."
"7","(off)"
"7","Howard: The doctor says you need to get exercise."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise."
"7","Howard: Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise."
"7","Raj: If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?"
"7","Howard: She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham."
"7","Raj: All right. Now what?"
"7","Bernadette: We set it up in Howie’s old room."
"7","Raj: Do you know how to set it up?"
"7","Howard: Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me."
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Raj: So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks."
"7","Leonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz."
"7","Amy: Should we do something for her?"
"7","Sheldon: I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie."
"7","Amy: Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt."
"7","Sheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy."
"7","Penny: Hi."
"7","Leonard: Hey, how were things on the set?"
"7","Penny: Uh, pretty good, actually."
"7","Raj: So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?"
"7","Penny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all."
"7","Amy: Good for you."
"7","Penny: Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen."
"7","Leonard: I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat."
"7","Sheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust."
"7","Leonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: I know."
"7","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"7","Howard: Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room."
"7","Bernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs."
"7","Howard: You mean a forklift?"
"7","Bernadette: Howie."
"7","Howard: I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now."
"7","Bernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?"
"7","Howard: Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?"
"7","Bernadette: I would do it for my mother."
"7","Howard: Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz."
"7","Bernadette: Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?"
"7","Howard: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells."
"7","Bernadette: You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel."
"7","Howard: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle."
"7","Howard: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?"
"7","Bernadette: You are a putz."
"7","Howard: As advertised."
"7","Scene: A cinema."
"7","Sheldon: Thanks for coming with me."
"7","Raj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?"
"7","Sheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes."
"7","Raj: Is that a real thing?"
"7","Sheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out."
"7","Raj: Emily, Hey."
"7","Emily: Oh, hey, Raj."
"7","Raj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?"
"7","Emily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start."
"7","Raj: Are you here alone?"
"7","Emily: No, not really."
"7","Raj: What do you mean, not really?"
"7","Man: Hey, should we get our seats?"
"7","Emily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later."
"7","Raj: Yeah, okay."
"7","Sheldon: That was awkward, right?"
"7","Raj: Uh-huh."
"7","Sheldon: Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?"
"7","Raj: Yes."
"7","Sheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead."
"7","Scene: The movie set."
"7","Director: And action."
"7","Wil Wheaton: Please don’t shut me out."
"7","Penny: Go away. Just go away."
"7","Wil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back."
"7","Penny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?"
"7","Wil: I was trying to save your life."
"7","Penny: Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know."
"7","Wil: You can’t give up. I love you."
"7","Penny: I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you."
"7","Director: And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene."
"7","Penny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better."
"7","Director: Let’s just move on. No one cares."
"7","Penny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?"
"7","Director: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it."
"7","Leonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her."
"7","Director: And who are you?"
"7","Leonard: I’m her boyfriend."
"7","Director: Isn’t she too hot for you?"
"7","Leonard: A little, yeah."
"7","Director: Well, boyfriend, get off my set."
"7","Penny: You can’t do that. He’s with me."
"7","Director: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired."
"7","Penny: What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster."
"7","Director: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this."
"7","Wil: Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too."
"7","Scene: A bar."
"7","Wil: Wow, that fell apart really fast."
"7","Raj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea."
"7","Raj: You don’t have to make me anything."
"7","Sheldon: No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?"
"7","Raj: Sorry, I left them in my turban."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?"
"7","Raj: Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?"
"7","Sheldon: Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me."
"7","Raj: But you don’t have sex with her, either."
"7","Sheldon: Slick, huh?"
"7","Raj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other."
"7","Sheldon: Have you had intercourse?"
"7","Raj: No."
"7","Sheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m hungry again."
"7","Howard: It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock."
"7","Bernadette: You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like."
"7","Howard: No, it’s not."
"7","Bernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own."
"7","Howard: Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth."
"7","Bernadette: I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work."
"7","Howard: Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m still hungry."
"7","Howard: I’m coming, you big baby."
"7","Scene: The bar."
"7","Penny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass."
"7","Wil: Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing."
"7","Penny: Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous."
"7","Wil: Hey. I just lost a job for you."
"7","Penny: All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous."
"7","Wil: Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer."
"7","(Text message tone)"
"7","Penny: God, what am I doing with my life?"
"7","Leonard: You having second thoughts about acting?"
"7","Penny: You were on set, you saw what it was like."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, but it’s not always that bad."
"7","Penny: Oh, really?"
"7","Leonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?"
"7","Penny: It was over a bowling alley."
"7","Leonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking."
"7","Penny: Are you done?"
"7","Leonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial."
"7","Penny: It was for haemorrhoid cream."
"7","Leonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you."
"7","Penny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up."
"7","Leonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?"
"7","Penny: Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny."
"7","Raj: I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?"
"7","Sheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night."
"7","Raj: What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now."
"7","Sheldon: That’s your problem. You can’t be alone."
"7","Raj: What do you mean?"
"7","Sheldon: How many women have you had dates with?"
"7","Raj: Eleven."
"7","Sheldon: How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?"
"7","Raj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?"
"7","Sheldon: Sure."
"7","Raj: I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better."
"7","Sheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?"
"7","Raj: Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone."
"7","Sheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night."
"7","Bernadette: Howie, I’m back!"
"7","Howard: Shh, I just got her to sleep."
"7","Bernadette: Sorry."
"7","Howard: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away."
"7","Bernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes."
"7","Howard: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?"
"7","Bernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha."
"7","Howard: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen."
"7","Bernadette: Queen? I’ve been killing myself here."
"7","Howard: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people."
"7","Bernadette: I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard."
"7","Howard: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again."
"7","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"7","Raj: Hey."
"7","Emily: Thanks for letting me come over."
"7","Raj: Of course. Please, come in."
"7","Emily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay."
"7","Raj: Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other."
"7","Emily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with."
"7","Raj: It’s okay."
"7","Emily: Really?"
"7","Raj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours."
"7","Emily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset."
"7","Raj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen."
"7","Emily: Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else."
"7","Raj: Well, me, neither."
"7","Emily: Okay."
"7","Raj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?"
"7","Emily: Yeah."
"7","Raj: I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing."
"7","Emily: That’s cool."
"7","Raj: It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?"
"7","Emily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder."
"7","Raj: It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder."
"7","Emily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?"
"7","Raj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny: Oh, my God. What a day."
"7","Leonard: Can I get you anything?"
"7","Penny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions."
"7","Leonard: With your career?"
"7","Penny: With my life."
"7","Leonard: Like what?"
"7","Penny: I don’t know. We could get married."
"7","Leonard: Come on, be serious."
"7","Penny: I am."
"7","Leonard: Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?"
"7","Penny: Well, yeah."
"7","Leonard: So I’m like a bran muffin."
"7","Penny: What? No, that’s not what I’m saying."
"7","Leonard: No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you."
"7","Penny: What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you."
"7","Leonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes."
"7","Penny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want."
"7","Leonard: No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon."
"7","Penny: You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up."
"7","Leonard: You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself."
"7","Penny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy."
"7","Leonard: Then what do you need?"
"7","Penny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart."
"7","Leonard: Oh. Then I guess I’m in."
"7","Penny: Really? You guess you’re in?"
"7","Leonard: Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!"
"7","Penny: Okay. Leonard: Cool."
"7","Leonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?"
"7","Penny: Yeah, I think so."
"7","Leonard: All right."
"7","Penny: What’s wrong?"
"7","Leonard: I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic."
"7","Penny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, I know. This might help."
"7","Penny: Where did you get a ring?"
"7","Leonard: I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?"
"7","Penny: Oh, my God, yes."
"7","Leonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger."
"7","Howard: How you feeling?"
"7","Bernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this."
"7","Howard: I’m proud of us."
"7","Bernadette: Me, too."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where’s my pancakes?!"
"7","Foreign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!"
"7","Bernadette: You were right."
"7","Howard: Welcome to Team Putz."
"7","Series 07 Episode 24 – The Status Quo Combustion"
"7","Scene: The Apartment."
"7","Leonard: How’s your mom holding up?"
"7","Howard: She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse."
"7","Amy: How many is that now?"
"7","Howard: Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them."
"7","Bernadette: She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting."
"7","Sheldon: So, who’s watching her now?"
"7","Howard: A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in."
"7","Raj: What up, guys?"
"7","All: Hello, hey!"
"7","Leonard: Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged."
"7","General cheering and congratulations."
"7","Raj: And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news."
"7","Leonard: Hey, hey, what the hell?"
"7","Bernadette: You guys propose all the time. This never happens."
"7","Penny: You’re right! Yay!"
"7","Credits sequence."
"7","Scene: The cafeteria."
"7","Raj: Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?"
"7","Howard: Because you had sex the other night?"
"7","Raj: You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times."
"7","Leonard: Hey, buddy."
"7","Sheldon: Hello."
"7","Leonard: You okay?"
"7","Sheldon: I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory."
"7","Howard: Why?"
"7","Sheldon: He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face."
"7","Leonard: That’s a rude thing to say, out loud."
"7","Sheldon: It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university."
"7","Howard: You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat."
"7","Leonard: Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know. I am really aggravated."
"7","Raj: When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me."
"7","Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house."
"7","Howard: Oh, come on, give her a chance."
"7","Nurse: No. Life, it is too short."
"7","Bernadette: I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people."
"7","Howard: Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea."
"7","Bernadette: That’s not helpful."
"7","Howard: Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months."
"7","Bernadette: But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day."
"7","Howard: Well, what if we use our vacation time?"
"7","Bernadette: I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell."
"7","Howard: I don’t know what else we can do."
"7","Bernadette: Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce."
"7","Scene: The apartment."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard."
"7","(on webcam)"
"7","Leonard: Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: I’m listening."
"7","Leonard: Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?"
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged."
"7","Leonard: I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: Would you like for you and me to talk more?"
"7","Leonard: You know what? It’s probably fine."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me."
"7","Leonard: I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?"
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: Sure."
"7","Leonard: Thanks, Mom."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?"
"7","Leonard: Yes, it would."
"7","Mrs Hofstadter: Yeah. Well, you should work on that."
"7","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"7","Penny (on phone): No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye."
"7","(on phone)"
"7","Amy: Atomic magnets?"
"7","Penny: Shut up."
"7","Bernadette: Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law."
"7","Penny: You want some wine?"
"7","Bernadette: Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family."
"7","Penny: I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me."
"7","Bernadette: It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again."
"7","Amy: So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?"
"7","Penny: Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me."
"7","Amy: Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense."
"7","Bernadette: You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?"
"7","Penny: Not a chance."
"7","Bernadette: Please. I’m desperate."
"7","Penny: No."
"7","Bernadette: I’ll pay you anything you want."
"7","Penny: Okay, then, yeah."
"7","Penny: No, keep your money."
"7","Bernadette: I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that."
"7","Leonard: What you working on?"
"7","Sheldon: I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory."
"7","Leonard: Oh. How’s it going?"
"7","Sheldon: You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand."
"7","Leonard: It’s nice that you called them esteemed."
"7","Sheldon: You’re right. I’ll take that out."
"7","Leonard: So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you."
"7","Sheldon: Mm."
"7","Leonard: Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements."
"7","Sheldon: Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding."
"7","Leonard: I’m not."
"7","Sheldon: Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish."
"7","Leonard: Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live."
"7","Sheldon: What do you mean?"
"7","Leonard: Well, well, we might want to live together."
"7","Sheldon: Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining."
"7","Leonard: That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?"
"7","Leonard: Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary."
"7","Sheldon: Where are you going to go?"
"7","Leonard: I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall."
"7","Sheldon: Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?"
"7","Leonard: No, I did not."
"7","Sheldon: Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?"
"7","Leonard: No."
"7","Sheldon: Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?"
"7","Leonard: Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves."
"7","Sheldon: I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine."
"7","Leonard: Well, yeah."
"7","Sheldon: Wow."
"7","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"7","Sheldon: How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?"
"7","Amy: They just don’t appreciate you."
"7","Sheldon: Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more."
"7","Amy: Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik."
"7","Sheldon: I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy."
"7","Amy: You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there."
"7","Sheldon: Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes."
"7","Amy: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain."
"7","Sheldon: Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?"
"7","Amy: See? Maybe you’ll love living alone."
"7","Sheldon: I don’t know. Perhaps."
"7","Amy: And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together."
"7","Sheldon: You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?"
"7","Amy: Sheldon, it was just a thought."
"7","Sheldon: No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder."
"7","Amy: It tastes the same."
"7","Sheldon: No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it."
"7","Penny: This is so sweet. You never cook for me."
"7","Leonard: Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh."
"7","Penny: If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?"
"7","Leonard: It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do."
"7","Penny: Sorry. I’ll get better."
"7","Leonard: I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?"
"7","Penny: Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule."
"7","Leonard: Okay. And when would that be?"
"7","Penny: Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour."
"7","Amy: Hi, is Sheldon here?"
"7","Leonard: No, I thought he was with you."
"7","Amy: He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone."
"7","Leonard: What happened?"
"7","Amy: He was really angry that you suggested he move out."
"7","Leonard: Oh."
"7","Amy: I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is."
"7","Leonard: Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress."
"7","Amy: You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?"
"7","Penny: Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple."
"7","Amy: That’s nice."
"7","Leonard: Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really."
"7","Amy: Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?"
"7","Penny: Amy, get out."
"7","Amy: Right."
"7","Scene: The comic book store."
"7","Sheldon: No."
"7","Stuart: Hey, Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: What happened?"
"7","Stuart: I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire."
"7","Sheldon: And you couldn’t put it out?"
"7","Stuart: I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower."
"7","Sheldon: So when will you reopen?"
"7","Stuart: Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company."
"7","Sheldon: So, tomorrow?"
"7","Stuart: I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now."
"7","Sheldon: Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny."
"7","Stuart: Well, sorry I let you down."
"7","Sheldon: No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please."
"7","Stuart: That’ll be $2.99."
"7","Sheldon: Really? It’s soaking wet."
"7","Stuart: Fine, a dollar."
"7","Sheldon: Can you break a twenty?"
"7","Stuart: No, I only have hundreds."
"7","Sheldon: You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster."
"7","Stuart: (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before) That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break."
"7","(Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before)"
"7","Leonard: I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?"
"7","Penny: Oh, I’m sure he’s fine."
"7","Leonard: I’m gonna see where he is."
"7","Penny: How?"
"7","Leonard: Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone."
"7","Penny: You do that?"
"7","Leonard: Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried."
"7","Penny: He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle."
"7","Leonard: That’s weird."
"7","Penny: What?"
"7","Leonard: He’s at the train station."
"7","Penny: So? He loves trains."
"7","Leonard: It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him."
"7","Penny: It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy."
"7","Leonard: It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him."
"7","Raj: Dude, I’m so sorry."
"7","Howard: Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?"
"7","Stuart: No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company."
"7","Raj: We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?"
"7","Stuart: Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights."
"7","Raj: Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night."
"7","Stuart: You slept with her? Nice."
"7","Raj: Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel."
"7","Howard: Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time."
"7","Stuart: Great."
"7","Howard: I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse."
"7","Stuart: So what’s the catch?"
"7","Scene: The train station."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon."
"7","Sheldon: You tracked my phone?"
"7","Leonard: Yeah."
"7","Sheldon: Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles."
"7","Penny: We were worried about you."
"7","Sheldon: Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever."
"7","Leonard: Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush."
"7","Sheldon: My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land."
"7","Leonard: Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home."
"7","Sheldon: No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now."
"7","Penny: And go where?"
"7","Sheldon: It doesn’t matter."
"7","Leonard: So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?"
"7","Sheldon: I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can."
"7","Leonard: Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland."
"7","Sheldon: Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out."
"7","Leonard: Then what can I do?"
"7","Sheldon: Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think."
"7","Leonard: Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting."
"7","Penny: Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go."
"7","Leonard: What? Why?"
"7","Penny: It might be good for him."
"7","Leonard: You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself."
"7","Penny: He’s a grown man."
"7","Leonard: No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies."
"7","Penny: Leonard, we can’t protect him forever."
"7","Leonard: I know, but…"
"7","Penny: He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan."
"7","Sheldon: Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher."
"7","Penny: Seriously, let him go."
"7","Leonard: Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way."
"7","Sheldon: I do."
"7","Leonard: Okay. Good luck."
"7","Penny: Be safe and call us."
"7","Sheldon: I will."
"7","Leonard: Bye, buddy. Sheldon?"
"7","Sheldon: Yes?"
"7","Leonard: I’m gonna miss you."
"7","Sheldon: Of course you are."
"7","Leonard: He just made that easier."
"7","Penny: Mm."
"7","Stuart: Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home."
"7","Howard: You sure?"
"7","Stuart: Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked in and watching TV."
"7","Bernadette: So, she’s not too much for you?"
"7","Stuart: Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great."
"7","Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?"
