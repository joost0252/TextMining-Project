"9","Series 09 Episode 01 – The Matrimonial Momentum"
"9","Following a “previously on” sequence."
"9","Scene: A Wedding Chapel."
"9","Penny: So, what package are you thinking?"
"9","Leonard: Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet."
"9","Penny: Why would we want that?"
"9","Leonard: ‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope."
"9","Penny: Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section."
"9","Leonard: If you’re not into this, we can do it another time."
"9","Penny: No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it."
"9","Leonard: Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. (Phone) Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey."
"9","(Phone)"
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, have you gotten married yet?"
"9","Leonard: No. Why?"
"9","Sheldon: Good. Don’t do it."
"9","Leonard: Why not?"
"9","Sheldon: Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep."
"9","Leonard: What happened now?"
"9","Sheldon: Amy has ended our relationship."
"9","Leonard: Oh, no. Seriously?"
"9","Penny: What’s going on?"
"9","Leonard: Amy broke up with Sheldon."
"9","Penny: She did?"
"9","Sheldon: Is Penny crying?"
"9","Leonard: No."
"9","Sheldon: No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering."
"9","Leonard: Buddy, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things."
"9","Leonard: Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad."
"9","Sheldon: Whatever."
"9","Penny (on phone): Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?"
"9","(on phone)"
"9","Amy: Not really. Can you come over?"
"9","Penny: Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married."
"9","Amy: Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?"
"9","Penny: Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing."
"9","Amy: Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here."
"9","Penny: Amy, don’t be like that."
"9","Sheldon: Why did I just hear Amy’s name?"
"9","Leonard: Penny’s on the phone with her."
"9","Sheldon: Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care."
"9","Penny: Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Penny: She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit."
"9","Sheldon: Amy’s upset? Is it about me?"
"9","Leonard: No, I think it’s because we’re eloping."
"9","Sheldon: Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Outside Amy’s apartment."
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Amy: Oh. What are you doing here?"
"9","Sheldon: When last we spoke, you said you needed time."
"9","Amy: Well, it’s only been 11 hours."
"9","Sheldon: The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know."
"9","Sheldon: Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?"
"9","Amy: Sure."
"9","Sheldon: Boy, I’m glad we’re going out again."
"9","Amy: We’re not back together."
"9","Sheldon: Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?"
"9","Amy: If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding."
"9","Sheldon: And who’s this guy you’re taking?"
"9","Amy: There’s no guy."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad."
"9","Amy: I’m not gonna be alone. I’ll be with my friends."
"9","Sheldon: Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?"
"9","Amy: Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward."
"9","Sheldon: We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing."
"9","Scene: The Wedding Chapel."
"9","Leonard: They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon."
"9","Penny: Okay."
"9","Leonard: Hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door."
"9","Penny: Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs."
"9","Leonard: I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it’s not how I pictured it either, but I’m still glad we’re doing it."
"9","Penny: Me, too."
"9","Leonard: You sure?"
"9","Penny: Yes."
"9","Leonard: And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?"
"9","Penny: Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?"
"9","Leonard: You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?"
"9","Penny: What if they call our names?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster."
"9","Penny: Oh, and the fairy tale continues."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s House."
"9","Amy: Thank you for doing this."
"9","Bernadette: Our pleasure. You feeling okay?"
"9","Amy: We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling."
"9","Howard: Well, that’s understandable. You forgot. It’s called happy."
"9","Bernadette: Howard."
"9","Howard: I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon."
"9","Stuart: I know what you’re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough."
"9","Amy: Oh. What was her name?"
"9","Stuart: Hey, it’s a true story. I don’t need the third degree."
"9","Bernadette: For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?"
"9","Sheldon: I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom."
"9","Bernadette: Howard, do something."
"9","Howard: I’m on it."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better."
"9","Sheldon: I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?"
"9","Amy: They didn’t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here."
"9","Raj: Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?"
"9","Official: So, when you hear the music, that’s your cue. Any questions?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals."
"9","Official: Where are the rose petals?!"
"9","Female Voice We’re out"
"9","Leonard: You know what? It’s fine."
"9","Female Voice: We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!"
"9","Penny: Really, we’re good."
"9","Leonard: Yup, just want to get married."
"9","Penny: Yeah."
"9","Official: Great. I’ll see you two up there."
"9","Leonard: This is it."
"9","Penny: I know."
"9","Leonard: I love you."
"9","Penny: I love you, too."
"9","Female Voice: Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?"
"9","Penny: No, thank you."
"9","Leonard: We’re good."
"9","Sheldon: Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another."
"9","Raj: Didn’t even crack the top ten."
"9","Sheldon: Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me."
"9","Amy: I said I needed time to think."
"9","Raj: I’m sure you guys will figure something out."
"9","Sheldon: You hear that? Raj is devastated."
"9","Bernadette: Sheldon, shh. The wedding’s starting."
"9","Sheldon: I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team, I pick Howard."
"9","Howard: I’m not taking sides."
"9","Sheldon: Fine, I guess I’m stuck with Raj."
"9","Raj: Really?"
"9","Stuart: At least you got picked."
"9","Official: Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?"
"9","Leonard: Yes."
"9","Penny: No. You wrote vows?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah."
"9","Penny: Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad."
"9","Leonard: It’s okay. I don’t have to say them."
"9","Penny: No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this."
"9","Leonard: Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole."
"9","Penny: Wow."
"9","Official: Penny?"
"9","Penny: Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me."
"9","Official: Is that the song from Toy Story?"
"9","Penny: He loves that movie."
"9","Leonard: I do."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Bernadette: Aw, that was beautiful."
"9","Howard: Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful."
"9","Bernadette: No, we totally won."
"9","Sheldon: Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind."
"9","Amy: It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think."
"9","Sheldon: Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date."
"9","Amy: You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up."
"9","Bernadette: Amy."
"9","Sheldon: Will someone take me home?"
"9","Raj: Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride."
"9","Official (voice from computer) …symbolizes your eternal love. I now pronounce you husband and wife."
"9","(voice from computer)"
"9","Penny: We did it."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch."
"9","Howard: We’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section."
"9","Scene: Hotel corridor."
"9","Leonard: No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold."
"9","Penny: Can you?"
"9","Leonard: Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?"
"9","Penny: Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?"
"9","Leonard: I’m okay."
"9","Penny: Nicely done."
"9","Leonard: Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me."
"9","Penny: Well, the night is still young."
"9","Leonard: Everything all right?"
"9","Penny: Yeah. I guess."
"9","Leonard: Just tell me."
"9","Penny: It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl."
"9","Leonard: Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so."
"9","Penny: You’re right. Just forget it."
"9","Leonard: Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth."
"9","Penny: Did you feel guilty?"
"9","Leonard: No, she had dental insurance."
"9","Penny: Did you feel guilty after kissing her?"
"9","Leonard: Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her."
"9","Penny: What do you mean, every time you see her?"
"9","Leonard: What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie."
"9","Penny: You still see her?"
"9","Leonard: Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work."
"9","Penny: You work with her? How could you not tell me that?"
"9","Leonard: I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking"
"9","Penny: Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?"
"9","Leonard: No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon (on phone): Hello, Mother."
"9","Mrs Cooper: Shelly! How’s my baby doing?"
"9","Sheldon: I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head."
"9","Mrs Cooper: Oh, what’s going on?"
"9","Sheldon: She broke up with me."
"9","Mrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly."
"9","Sheldon: No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you."
"9","Mrs Cooper: Well, let’s not be hasty. Are you sure it’s over for good?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose."
"9","Mrs Cooper: You want to tell me what happened?"
"9","Sheldon: Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?"
"9","Mrs Cooper: Good chance."
"9","Sheldon: Then no, thank you."
"9","Mrs Cooper: Well, honey, don’t send it back yet. Your sister’s married, and I’m not letting your brother give my grandmother’s ring to that whore he’s dating."
"9","Sheldon: Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?"
"9","Mrs Cooper: When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants."
"9","Bernadette: I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better."
"9","Amy: Yeah."
"9","Howard: Everything’s gonna be okay."
"9","Stuart: You’ve got so much to offer."
"9","Amy: Thank you."
"9","Stuart: Any man would be lucky to have you."
"9","Bernadette: That’s true."
"9","Amy: I just hope I did the right thing."
"9","Stuart: I’m sure you did. Maybe that’s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it’s time to do the wrong thing."
"9","Amy: Like you’re doing right now?"
"9","Stuart: Exactly."
"9","Scene: The stairwell."
"9","Leonard: I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?"
"9","Penny: I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m not."
"9","Leonard: Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift."
"9","Sheldon: Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing."
"9","Leonard: I’m not glowing. I’m upset."
"9","Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Sheldon (outside): Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?"
"9","(outside)"
"9","Penny: What’s this?"
"9","Sheldon: Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage."
"9","Penny: Oh. That’s so sweet of you."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna."
"9","Penny: I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that."
"9","Penny: You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university."
"9","Sheldon: He does? Who is it?"
"9","Penny: Some girl named Mandy."
"9","Sheldon: Mandy Chao?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better"
"9","than Leonard."
"9","Penny: That’s great."
"9","Sheldon: Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I’m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson."
"9","Penny: That’s ridiculous."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard."
"9","Penny: I’m with Leonard."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?"
"9","Penny: Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it."
"9","Sheldon: Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?"
"9","Penny: I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy."
"9","Sheldon: Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?"
"9","Penny: Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend."
"9","Sheldon: I see. Well, I think I’ll be going."
"9","Penny: Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?"
"9","Penny: Sure."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed."
"9","Howard (on phone): All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow."
"9","Bernadette: What happened? They just got married."
"9","Howard: I don’t know. It’s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas."
"9","Bernadette: Think they’ll break up?"
"9","Howard: I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself."
"9","Stuart: Really?"
"9","Sheldon: Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?"
"9","Leonard: Sure, let’s make it an even hundred."
"9","Sheldon: You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me."
"9","Leonard: I wouldn’t."
"9","Sheldon: And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders."
"9","Leonard: Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie."
"9","Leonard: I figured that out."
"9","Sheldon: You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science."
"9","Leonard: Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you."
"9","Sheldon: Really? I never imagined it any other way."

"9","Series 09 Episode 02 – The Separation Oscillation"
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon: Why are you up?"
"9","Leonard: How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me."
"9","Sheldon: Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve."
"9","Penny (entering): Hi."
"9","(entering)"
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Penny: You couldn’t sleep either?"
"9","Leonard: Of course not."
"9","Sheldon: Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems."
"9","Leonard: What are we gonna do?"
"9","Penny: I don’t know."
"9","Leonard: Please, tell me how I can fix it."
"9","Sheldon: Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action."
"9","Leonard: Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard."
"9","Penny: Actually, I think he’s onto something."
"9","Leonard: You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m currently single."
"9","Penny: That’s true. You are."
"9","Leonard: What is happening?"
"9","Sheldon: I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage."
"9","Leonard (waking up): U-u-u-uh!"
"9","(waking up)"
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Amy (on skype): Sheldon, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again."
"9","(on skype)"
"9","Sheldon: Well, hello to you, too."
"9","Amy: What do you want?"
"9","Sheldon: I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together."
"9","Amy: What baby?"
"9","Sheldon: A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags."
"9","Amy: I’m hanging up."
"9","Sheldon: Great. See you in about half an hour."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you."
"9","Sheldon: Why not?"
"9","Amy: Because we’re broken up."
"9","Sheldon: Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them."
"9","Amy: No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher."
"9","Sheldon: You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it’s hard. It’s hard for me, too. But I’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together."
"9","Sheldon: Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again."
"9","Scene: The Comic Book Store."
"9","Raj: I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao."
"9","Leonard: Well, trust me, I wish it never happened."
"9","Raj: And you knew about this this whole time?"
"9","Howard: I did."
"9","Raj: And you didn’t think to tell me?"
"9","Howard: Leonard asked me to keep it to myself."
"9","Raj: Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me."
"9","Leonard: Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?"
"9","Raj: Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?"
"9","Howard: You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two."
"9","Raj: I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao."
"9","Leonard: Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out."
"9","Raj: Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you."
"9","Scene: Amy’s apartment. Sheldon knocks three times."
"9","Amy: What are you doing here?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do."
"9","Amy: And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door."
"9","Sheldon: On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits."
"9","Amy: Just give me the box."
"9","Sheldon: Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?"
"9","Amy: Fine. My old scarf."
"9","Sheldon: You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?"
"9","Amy: You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?"
"9","Sheldon: We made one heck of a team, huh?"
"9","Amy: Whose bra is this?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us."
"9","Amy: It’s Penny’s."
"9","Sheldon: Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough."
"9","Amy: Good-bye."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know."
"9","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"9","Howard: Ooh, brownies for girls’ night!"
"9","Bernadette: Hands off. I’m mad at you."
"9","Howard: Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself."
"9","Bernadette: What will pay for itself?"
"9","Howard: Doesn’t matter. What are you mad about?"
"9","Bernadette: I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years."
"9","Howard: And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don’t even look at it."
"9","Bernadette: I mean, if Penny finds out I’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think I’m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me."
"9","Howard: And I wish Leonard never told me. He’s the bad guy here."
"9","Bernadette: I guess that’s true."
"9","Howard: And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?"
"9","Leonard (on phone): Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here."
"9","(on phone)"
"9","Leonard: Call you back. Hey."
"9","Penny: Can we talk?"
"9","Leonard: I would love that."
"9","Penny: All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this, but I don’t know what to do."
"9","Leonard: If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling."
"9","Sheldon (entering): Hello."
"9","Leonard: Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours."
"9","Penny: Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more information."
"9","Sheldon: Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it."
"9","Penny: Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?"
"9","Sheldon: Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution."
"9","Leonard: Wake up, wake up, wake up."
"9","Sheldon: Bring Penny to meet Mandy."
"9","Leonard: What? Why?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch."
"9","Leonard: Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry."
"9","Sheldon: And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that."
"9","Leonard: Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy."
"9","Penny: Really? Why is that?"
"9","Leonard: What, you actually want to meet her?"
"9","Penny: No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe I should."
"9","Leonard: I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. And that’s coming from me."
"9","Leonard: Fine, you want to meet her?"
"9","Penny: No, I just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on."
"9","Leonard: How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman."
"9","Penny: Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you."
"9","Sheldon: In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Penny: I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this."
"9","Amy: Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment."
"9","Penny: What do you think?"
"9","Bernadette: I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it."
"9","Penny: You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met."
"9","Amy: Come on, you know Leonard’s not like that."
"9","Penny: I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?"
"9","Bernadette: Oh, I don’t know. This is all so new to me. I’m still processing."
"9","Penny: You know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now."
"9","Amy: That’s because you made him more confident."
"9","Bernadette: You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice."
"9","Penny: I never thought about it like that."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, me neither, not until just now."
"9","Sheldon: Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I’m holding a remote control. That’s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I’m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. We’re here to talk about flags. Tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible."
"9","Scene: The cafeteria."
"9","Leonard: You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?"
"9","Howard: 250 dollars an hour. Why?"
"9","Raj: How do you know?"
"9","Howard: Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things."
"9","Raj: And I’m just hearing about this now?"
"9","Howard: Dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on."
"9","Raj: You don’t have to, you should want to."
"9","Leonard: Oh, great, there’s Mandy."
"9","Howard: Why are marine biologists always so cute?"
"9","Raj: I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle."
"9","Leonard: That’s not helpful."
"9","Howard: Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area."
"9","Leonard: Are we done?"
"9","Raj: Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?"
"9","Leonard: I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about."
"9","Howard: Leonard, wait."
"9","Leonard: What?"
"9","Howard: I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants."
"9","Raj: Now we are done."
"9","Mandy: Oh, hi, Leonard. What’s up?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, do you mind if I sit?"
"9","Mandy: Sure."
"9","Leonard: So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat."
"9","Mandy: What about it?"
"9","Leonard: You know, what we did, when we were drunk."
"9","Mandy: Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?"
"9","Leonard: No, we just made out."
"9","Mandy: Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently."
"9","Mandy: Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?"
"9","Leonard: Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work."
"9","Mandy: It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?"
"9","Leonard: Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us."
"9","Mandy: Is that really the reason?"
"9","Leonard: What else would it be?"
"9","Mandy: I don’t know. Sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship."
"9","Leonard: No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that."
"9","Mandy: Okay, well, that’s something to think about."
"9","Leonard: You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her."
"9","Mandy: Oh, you’re gonna think about that right here?"
"9","Leonard: I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me."
"9","Mandy: Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this."
"9","Leonard: Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me."
"9","Mandy: Imagine that."
"9","Leonard: I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it."
"9","Mandy: And your wife is worried about me?"
"9","Raj: Hey, Leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more."
"9","Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is watching Fun With Flags."
"9","Sheldon (on screen): And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders."
"9","(on screen)"
"9","Amy: I’m gonna kill him."
"9","Sheldon: But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?"
"9","Penny: So, you said you had something to tell me."
"9","Leonard: Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?"
"9","Penny: Uh-huh."
"9","Leonard: I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why."
"9","Penny: I’m listening."
"9","Leonard: Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you."
"9","Penny: Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it."
"9","Leonard: You do?"
"9","Penny: Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you."
"9","Leonard: I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?"
"9","Penny: You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too."
"9","Leonard: Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?"
"9","Penny: That sounds nice."
"9","Leonard: Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time."
"9","Penny: Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me."
"9","Leonard: Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song."
"9","Penny: It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard."
"9","Leonard: Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?"
"9","Penny: Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?"
"9","Leonard: Yes, please."
"9","Penny: Okay."
"9","Penny: Sheldon, I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift."
"9","Sheldon: I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do."
"9","Leonard: What is this?"
"9","Sheldon: Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco."
"9","Penny: Oh."
"9","Leonard: Wow."
"9","Penny: That’s so great."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun."
"9","Penny: We?"
"9","Sheldon: Is there a problem?"
"9","Penny: Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee."
"9","Amy (at door): How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?"
"9","(at door)"
"9","Sheldon: You saw through that one, did you?"
"9","Amy: I don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now."
"9","Sheldon: She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back."
"9","Amy: I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad."
"9","Sheldon: She was listening through the door. She wants me."
"9","Series 09 Episode 03 – The Batchelor Party Corrosion"
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon: Would you pass the mustard?"
"9","Leonard: Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?"
"9","Sheldon: Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard."
"9","Raj (entering with Howard): Hey, there."
"9","(entering with Howard)"
"9","Leonard: Hey, you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour."
"9","Howard: Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you."
"9","Leonard: What are you talking about?"
"9","Raj: Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?"
"9","Leonard: When do we leave?"
"9","Howard: Right now."
"9","Raj: Yeah, Penny packed you a bag."
"9","Howard: Wow, okay."
"9","Sheldon: You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?"
"9","Raj: Oh, not just him, you’re coming, too."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?"
"9","Scene: Outside, by a van."
"9","Sheldon: Unhand me. This is ridiculous."
"9","Howard: I told you to put tape on his mouth."
"9","Raj: And I told you he bit me."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The van."
"9","Sheldon: It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon."
"9","Howard: Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting."
"9","Sheldon: It runs on syphilis?"
"9","Raj: This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman."
"9","Sheldon: No."
"9","Howard: Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it."
"9","Leonard: This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool."
"9","Raj: Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it."
"9","Howard: I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, and talked about physics with them."
"9","Leonard: So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?"
"9","Raj: Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea."
"9","Leonard: India."
"9","Raj: We can drive there."
"9","Leonard: Your house?"
"9","Howard: We are going to Me-hi-co."
"9","Leonard: Fun, I’ve never been there."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico."
"9","Raj: What’s wrong with Mexico?"
"9","Sheldon: Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside."
"9","Howard: Okay, calm down. There’s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize."
"9","Sheldon: Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Bernadette: Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?"
"9","Penny: Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower."
"9","Amy (entering): Hi."
"9","(entering)"
"9","Penny: Hey."
"9","Amy: I know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals."
"9","Penny: You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic."
"9","Amy: Thank you. The veins are gummy worms."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, look, Jewish and gentile."
"9","Amy: I had extra dough."
"9","Penny (reading text): Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the border."
"9","(reading text)"
"9","Bernadette: I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico."
"9","Penny: Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement."
"9","Amy: Boy, that was a long night for me."
"9","Sheldon: Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes."
"9","Raj: We don’t have any of those."
"9","Sheldon: How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos."
"9","Leonard: If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?"
"9","Sheldon: Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?"
"9","Howard: You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico."
"9","Sheldon: You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot."
"9","Amy: So, Penny, how’s married life?"
"9","Penny: Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here."
"9","Bernadette: You guys still aren’t living together?"
"9","Penny: We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows."
"9","Bernadette: Speaking of Sheldon, how’s single life treating you?"
"9","Amy: Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe."
"9","Penny: Yes."
"9","Bernadette: Good for you."
"9","Amy: But then I decided I don’t want to go changing who I am just because of some man."
"9","Penny: You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup."
"9","Amy: Actually, I was thinking of making one small change."
"9","Bernadette: Your sweater?"
"9","Penny: Your glasses?"
"9","Bernadette: Your hair?"
"9","Penny: Your shoes."
"9","Amy: Piercing my ears."
"9","Penny: Oh."
"9","Bernadette: You really never had that done?"
"9","Amy: My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies."
"9","Penny: Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now."
"9","Amy: I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a Klingon."
"9","Bernadette: We’ll take you to the mall to get it done."
"9","Penny: Why? I can do it right here."
"9","Amy: Really? You have a piercing gun?"
"9","Penny: No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times."
"9","Amy: Oh, I don’t know."
"9","Penny: Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity."
"9","Bernadette: This party’s weird."
"9","Leonard: Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists."
"9","Howard: Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head."
"9","Raj: Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?"
"9","Howard: I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?"
"9","Leonard: Sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool."
"9","Sheldon: It is extraordinary."
"9","Raj: Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness."
"9","Sheldon: I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing."
"9","Howard: Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants."
"9","Sheldon: What was that?"
"9","Howard: I think it’s a tyre."
"9","Sheldon: What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?"
"9","Howard: It’s the tyre."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard?"
"9","Leonard: What?"
"9","Sheldon: I am getting too old for this crud."
"9","Bernadette: Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook."
"9","Amy: You’re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I’m no longer in a relationship."
"9","Bernadette: Did you change yours to married yet?"
"9","Penny: Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally."
"9","Amy: Who?"
"9","Penny: Oh, just my parents and my entire family."
"9","Bernadette: What?"
"9","Amy: Why?"
"9","Penny: Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding."
"9","Bernadette: What about your sister’s wedding?"
"9","Penny: They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart."
"9","Amy: How long do you think you can keep it from him?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?"
"9","Penny: Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical."
"9","Scene: Mexico."
"9","Raj: When did you learn how to change a tyre?"
"9","Howard: Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road."
"9","Sheldon: If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down."
"9","Leonard: And there’s your damsel."
"9","Howard: Wow, this one’s really stuck."
"9","Raj: Are you turning it the right way?"
"9","Howard: No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I’m in a rut, let’s shake things up."
"9","Raj: Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way."
"9","Penny: There you go. You’re all done."
"9","Amy: That wasn’t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet."
"9","Bernadette: That’s a joke, right?"
"9","Amy: Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats."
"9","Penny: I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close."
"9","Bernadette: Bet she’d still tell her if she got married."
"9","Penny: You’re not gonna let this go, are you?"
"9","Amy: Well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. I mean, they love Leonard."
"9","Penny: Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?"
"9","Bernadette: It’s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon."
"9","Penny: Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?"
"9","Amy: Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven’t told her yet."
"9","Penny: You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?"
"9","Amy: I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about."
"9","Penny: Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother."
"9","Amy: Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this."
"9","Penny: Hey, Daddy."
"9","Penny’s Dad: Hey, slugger. How’s my girl?"
"9","Penny: Uh, good. Is Mom around?"
"9","Penny’s Dad: Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she’s gonna make him a little necklace."
"9","Penny: Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married."
"9","Penny’s Dad: You did? When?"
"9","Penny: Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed."
"9","Penny’s Dad: Are you happy?"
"9","Penny: Very. Leonard is so great."
"9","Penny’s Dad: Well, then I’m happy for you."
"9","Penny: Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much."
"9","Penny’s Dad: Well, I understand it’s hard to tell someone something if you think it’s gonna upset ’em."
"9","Penny: It is. You’re the best dad ever."
"9","Penny’s Dad: Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I’ve been sitting on a little news myself."
"9","Penny: Well, what is it?"
"9","Penny’s Dad: You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?"
"9","Penny: No."
"9","Penny’s Dad: Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it."
"9","Penny: Moondance?"
"9","Penny’s Dad: Yeah, he’s, uh, not dancing anymore."
"9","Penny: You killed my pig?"
"9","Penny’s Dad: I did not kill him. The vet took care of that."
"9","Penny: When?"
"9","Penny’s Dad: Oh, ten, twelve months ago."
"9","Penny: You didn’t tell me for a year?"
"9","Penny’s Dad: Well, apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go."
"9","Bernadette: Okay, Amy, your turn."
"9","Howard: What are you doing?"
"9","Raj: It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push."
"9","Howard: Great. He’s pushing with his uterus."
"9","Raj: There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem."
"9","Sheldon: Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."
"9","Raj: Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this."
"9","Howard: Exactly. I’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever."
"9","Leonard: Let’s see, a lever, a lever."
"9","Sheldon: Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work."
"9","Leonard: We’re gonna be here foreever."
"9","Penny: Thanks a lot, guys."
"9","Bernadette: What did we do?"
"9","Penny: Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother."
"9","Bernadette: Really? They didn’t eat him?"
"9","Penny: No. He was a beloved member of the family."
"9","Bernadette: The breakfast meat family?"
"9","Penny: It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother."
"9","Amy: Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry."
"9","Penny: Phone, now."
"9","Amy: Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom."
"9","Penny: Try dialing."
"9","Amy: You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?"
"9","Penny: Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you."
"9","Leonard: I don’t think the lever’s working."
"9","Howard: What makes you say that?"
"9","Leonard: There’s gotta be something else we could try."
"9","Raj: If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off."
"9","Howard: No, it’s too broad of a beam. You’d need something more precise, like Superman’s heat vision."
"9","Sheldon: Ooh, the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it."
"9","Raj: If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper."
"9","Leonard: Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up."
"9","Caption: Scientific Principle: Percussive Shock."
"9","Howard (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you."
"9","(singing)"
"9","Howard and Raj (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you."

"9","Caption: Scientific Principle: Thermal Expansion."
"9","Raj: I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source."
"9","Leonard: They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands."
"9","Sheldon: What if that burning food attracts animals?"
"9","Howard: We have plenty of food for the animals."
"9","Sheldon: We do?"
"9","Howard: Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt."
"9","Sheldon: That’s not very nice."
"9","Leonard: It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up."
"9","Caption: Scientific Principle: Accelerated Corrosion."
"9","Sheldon: What is that awful smell?"
"9","Howard: It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off."
"9","Sheldon: What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit."
"9","Howard: Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters."
"9","Caption: Scientific Principle: Exothermic Reaction."
"9","Sheldon: All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite."
"9","Howard: Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick."
"9","Raj: Is that enough to melt the lug nut?"
"9","Leonard: Well, let’s start small. We can always add more."
"9","Howard: You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match."
"9","Scene: A moment later, next to the burning van."
"9","Raj: Hey, look, the lug nut’s off."
"9","Scene: The stairwell."
"9","Penny: What? What are you doing back?"
"9","Leonard: We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off."
"9","Penny: Oh, I’m sorry."
"9","Leonard: Thank you."
"9","Penny: If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet."
"9","Sheldon: We blew up Feynman’s van."
"9","Penny: My dad killed my pig with his tractor."
"9","Leonard: I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon."

"9","Leonard: I still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You’re a young man."
"9","Sheldon: Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I’m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?"
"9","Leonard: It’s just where I need them. You know, she doesn’t have a lot of closet space."
"9","Sheldon: What’s wrong with your closet?"
"9","Penny: Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together."
"9","Sheldon: So that’s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?"
"9","Leonard: Come on, buddy."
"9","Sheldon: No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might’ve said yes."
"9","Penny: Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this."
"9","Sheldon: You know what they don’t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you for letting me come speak with you."
"9","Bernadette: Of course."
"9","Sheldon: As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement."
"9","Bernadette: Aw. I’m honoured."
"9","Sheldon: I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard’s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers."
"9","Bernadette: So, I’m your seventh choice."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting."
"9","Bernadette: How can I help you?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard’s moving in with Penny. It’s difficult not to feel abandoned."
"9","Bernadette: Well, why don’t you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new."
"9","Sheldon: Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt’s all the rage right now. I wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom."
"9","Stuart: Hey."
"9","Bernadette: Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?"
"9","Sheldon: Gandalf, but he’s a smoker."
"9","Bernadette: Stuart. He’s been living with us for a while now. I’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair."
"9","Stuart: Nope, couldn’t be happier."
"9","Bernadette: Well, Sheldon’s looking for a roommate."
"9","Stuart: Nope."
"9","Bernadette: He’ll think about it."
"9","Stuart: No I won’t."
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Raj: Have you seen this Archie comic? It’s actually Archie versus Predator."
"9","Howard: How could Archie defeat Predator?"
"9","Raj: I don’t know. Maybe Jughead’s a Terminator."
"9","Howard: Hey, Stuart."
"9","Stuart: Do you guys know any musicians?"
"9","Howard: Why?"
"9","Stuart: I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe."
"9","Howard: What kind of music are you thinking of?"
"9","Stuart: I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free."
"9","Raj: Hey, we’ve always talked about playing together."
"9","Howard: Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing."
"9","Raj: Oh, we could play filk music."
"9","Stuart: What’s that?"
"9","Raj: It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme."
"9","Stuart: I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn’t be expected to pay for."
"9","Raj: Dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name."
"9","Howard: You know, I’ve actually had one I’ve been sitting on for years."
"9","Raj: Really?"
"9","Howard: It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends."
"9","Raj: What is it?"
"9","Howard: Footprints on the Moon."
"9","Raj: I just got chills."
"9","Howard: So did I."
"9","Stuart: Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon: Just a few more signatures, and we’ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I’d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it."
"9","Penny: I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well."
"9","Sheldon: Well, it’s not like I’m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion."
"9","Leonard: Do I really have to do that now?"
"9","Sheldon: No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that’s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates."
"9","Penny: What’s the matter?"
"9","Leonard: It’s harder than I thought."
"9","Sheldon: Let me help you. L. E. O. N."
"9","Leonard: That helped."
"9","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"9","Raj: So I have an idea for a filk song. It’s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions."
"9","Howard: Is it cold in here, ’cause, oh, my."
"9","Raj: Okay, so it’s a, it’s a David and Goliath story. It’s about man against God. It’s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones."
"9","Howard: Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind."
"9","Raj: Okay, I don’t have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that’s no man, it’s a Norse god."
"9","Howard: Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma."
"9","Raj: That is, that is so good!"
"9","Howard: Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me."
"9","Raj: Okay, and here’s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
"9","Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
"9","Howard: Oh, man, that rocks."
"9","Raj: Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?"
"9","Howard: Yeah?"
"9","Raj: That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off."
"9","Sheldon: I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions."
"9","Bespectacled Man: Sure."
"9","Sheldon: It says here you’re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?"
"9","Bespectacled Man: Is that supposed to be a joke?"
"9","Sheldon: Looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem."
"9","Fade to another candidate."
"9","Sheldon: In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?"
"9","Sheldon: I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?"
"9","Sheldon: You’re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I’ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the frontrunner."
"9","Amy (on Skype): I’m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon."
"9","(on Skype)"
"9","Sheldon: But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back."
"9","Amy: I’m sure you’ll find somebody else."
"9","Sheldon: I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I’d say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?"
"9","Amy: I don’t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life."
"9","Sheldon: They didn’t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart."
"9","Amy: I don’t think that was the point of the movie."
"9","Sheldon: Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy."
"9","Amy: There you go."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Penny: So, what are you thinking for dinner?"
"9","Leonard: Well, it’s Thai food night."
"9","Penny: Well, honey, you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want."
"9","Leonard: You’re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?"
"9","Penny: How about Thai food?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, thank God."
"9","Penny: Hey, we’re going to dinner. You want to come?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I’ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I’m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard."
"9","Leonard: You heard him, no."
"9","Penny: Hang on. Wait, you actually think it’s 2003?"
"9","Sheldon: No, just because I’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean I’m delusional. And since it is 2003, I don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone."
"9","Scene: A Thai restaurant."
"9","Penny: Are you doing okay?"
"9","Leonard: I guess. I’m just, you know, worried about Sheldon."
"9","Penny: Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine."
"9","Leonard: I hope so."
"9","Penny: What else can you do? Move back in with him?"
"9","Leonard: No, of course not. I just feel bad."
"9","Penny: Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?"
"9","Leonard: I did like that he had the weather on it."
"9","Penny: Trust me, this is the right thing."
"9","Leonard: I know. And it’s not like we’re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe."
"9","Scene: A bar."
"9","Bernadette: I can’t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate."
"9","Amy: I can’t believe he ran my credit."
"9","Bernadette: Hey, if you’re open to living with someone great, I’ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart."
"9","Amy: You really should’ve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one."
"9","Bernadette: I’m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life."
"9","Amy: Hey, I know Sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair."
"9","Sheldon: Hello, 2003."
"9","Leonard: Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?"
"9","Sheldon: In my present, it’s in the future. In your present, it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot."
"9","Leonard: I know what you’re doing. You’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you, but it’s not happening."
"9","Sheldon: No, what I’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me."
"9","Leonard: Will you knock it off? We’re across the hall."
"9","Sheldon: As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand."
"9","Penny: They’re not saying that."
"9","Sheldon: They are in 2003."
"9","Penny: No, no, they’re really not."
"9","Raj (singing): Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?"
"9","(singing)"
"9","Emily: Wow."
"9","Raj: Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder."
"9","Emily: Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder."
"9","Raj: Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?"
"9","Emily: I think it’s very cute."
"9","Raj: Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables."
"9","Emily: Okay, fine, it’s not cute."
"9","Raj: Just be honest. You don’t like it."
"9","Emily: I didn’t say that. I, I just like music you can dance to."
"9","Raj: You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
"9","Raj: I’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it."
"9","Howard: Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think."
"9","Raj: You can do both, like Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. While you’re dancing you’re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?"
"9","Howard: Where’s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song."
"9","Raj: I still love it. I just think there’s room for improvement."
"9","Howard: You played it for Emily, didn’t you?"
"9","Raj: Yeah, so what?"
"9","Howard: You are such a wimp. She didn’t like it, now you don’t like it."
"9","Raj: No, no. I’m just evolving as a musician. You’re the one who’s stuck in the past."
"9","Howard: The past was lunch. You know what’s really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band."
"9","Raj: She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man."
"9","Howard: Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to sleep with you."
"9","Raj: That is so not true."
"9","Howard: Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?"
"9","Raj: That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury."
"9","Howard: I don’t need this. I’m quitting the band."
"9","Raj: Fine, I quit, too."
"9","Howard: Then get out of my house."
"9","Raj: With pleasure."
"9","Howard: Raj, wait."
"9","Raj: What took you so long?"
"9","Leonard: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it’s not."
"9","Sheldon: How can you say that? Amy’s gone, and you two are married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone, too."
"9","Penny: Okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen."
"9","Sheldon: No, I do. Eventually you’ll want more space, and you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding, where she’s marrying someone better than me."
"9","Penny: Okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here."
"9","Sheldon: But mostly here."
"9","Penny: Sure."
"9","Leonard: Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?"
"9","Penny: Well, it’s not forever. It’s just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he’s our dog."
"9","Sheldon: You can. I’m happy when you come home. And I’m scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we’re all sleeping here."
"9","Leonard: Fine."
"9","Sheldon: All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I’ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we’re good."
"9","Howard (singing): Indy’ whip snapped, Thor’s hammer missed."
"9",""
"9","Raj (singing): It was Avenger versus archeologist."
"9","Howard: Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora."
"9","Raj: Thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura."
"9","Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
"9","Stuart: Play something we can dance to."
"9","Series 09 Episode 05 – The Perspiration Implementation"
"9","Scene: Howard’s workshop."
"9","Leonard: Hey, ready for lunch?"
"9","Howard: Oh, one sec."
"9","Sheldon: Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?"
"9","Howard: No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising."
"9","Leonard: That’ll teach her to care about your health."
"9","Howard: Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young."
"9","Raj: When was the last actual exercise you got?"
"9","Howard: The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her."
"9","Sheldon: According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now."
"9","Raj: Are you?"
"9","Sheldon: Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow."
"9","Leonard: It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active."
"9","Howard: You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Leonard: Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football."
"9","Sheldon: Had me at flag, lost me at football."
"9","Penny: Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?"
"9","Leonard: What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?"
"9","Penny: Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble."
"9","Leonard: I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club."
"9","Sheldon: Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport."
"9","Leonard: It’s indoors, so no sunscreen."
"9","Sheldon: No throwing, no catching, no running."
"9","Leonard: No gym shorts that can be yanked down."
"9","Sheldon: Or worse, up."
"9","Leonard: Preach."
"9","Sheldon: And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense."
"9","Leonard: What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?"
"9","Sheldon: Ah, touché."
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Stuart: Thanks for coming by."
"9","Bernadette: Sure. So how can we help?"
"9","Stuart: Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can’t get ’em in here."
"9","Penny: All right, well, what have you tried so far?"
"9","Stuart: Uh, I’ve, I’ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area."
"9","Penny: Really? In a comic book store?"
"9","Stuart: Oh, don’t worry. I, I’ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?"
"9","Amy: Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog."
"9","Stuart: Well, you don’t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch."
"9","Scene: The gym."
"9","Raj: I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots."
"9","Leonard: I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid."
"9","Sheldon: Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have."
"9","Raj: We can still be swashers."
"9","Howard: Well said, Puss."
"9","Barry: Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn’t a joke. I hope you’re not here because you think it’s going to be wike Star Wars."
"9","Leonard: That’s not why we’re here."
"9","Raj: Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones."
"9","Howard: And maybe a little Princess Bride."
"9","Raj: Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer."
"9","Barry: Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you’re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now."
"9","Sheldon: We’re not afraid of physical activity."
"9","Howard: Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today."
"9","Barry: Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, dear."
"9","Barry: What’s wong, Cooper?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive."
"9","Howard: When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?"
"9","Sheldon: Right. Always right."
"9","Howard: He’s a righty."
"9","Barry: Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance."
"9","Howard: Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow."
"9","Barry: The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance."
"9","Leonard: This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup."
"9","Barry: Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me, Barry?"
"9","Barry: Yes."
"9","Sheldon: When can I stab one of my friends?"
"9","Barry: In fencing, we don’t call it a stab. We call it a touch."
"9","Sheldon: Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources."
"9","Barry: Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. (Phone rings) Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I’m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee."
"9","(Phone rings)"
"9","Amy: Have you thought about advertising directly to females?"
"9","Stuart: Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don’t be afraid."
"9","Penny: Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?"
"9","Stuart: Eh, the Internet’s so negative. I try to avoid it."
"9","Penny: All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me."
"9","Stuart: See? Negative."
"9","Barry: With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again."
"9","Raj: Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes."
"9","Sheldon: En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching."
"9","Howard: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
"9","Raj: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
"9","Howard: I thought you were Puss in Boots."
"9","Raj: Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
"9","Sheldon: I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping."
"9","Leonard: What?"
"9","Sheldon: You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove."
"9","Leonard: When was your honour insulted?"
"9","Sheldon: My last physical."
"9","Leonard: Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate."
"9","Raj: My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
"9","Howard: My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die."
"9","Sheldon: Ah, this is fun."
"9","Leonard: Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy."
"9","Barry: What’s going on with Amy?"
"9","Sheldon: Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me."
"9","Barry: Weawwy? Good to know."
"9","Sheldon: Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?"
"9","Leonard: Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her."
"9","Sheldon: Well, that’s unacceptable."
"9","Leonard: Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb."
"9","Leonard: Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point."
"9","Sheldon: You really think so?"
"9","Leonard: Of course. She deserves to be happy."
"9","Sheldon: How dare you."
"9","Scene: Later."
"9","Leonard: Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea."
"9","Sheldon: Barry, a word?"
"9","Leonard: And now the crazy version of what I just said."
"9","Sheldon: If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it."
"9","Barry: And how are you gonna do that?"
"9","Sheldon: By challenging you to a duel."
"9","Barry: You’ve had one wesson. I’ll destwoy you."
"9","Sheldon: That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over."
"9","Leonard: Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought."
"9","Stuart: All right, I’m not saying it’s true, but let’s, let’s consider for a moment that possibly I’m the problem."
"9","Penny: Yeah."
"9","Bernadette: You are."
"9","Amy: You can say it."
"9","Stuart: Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women."
"9","Penny: Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous."
"9","Stuart: Well, that’s ’cause I’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies."
"9","Amy: Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?"
"9","Stuart: It was a joke."
"9","Bernadette: Was it?"
"9","Stuart: No, I’m still doing it."
"9","Penny: Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?"
"9","Stuart: I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself."
"9","Bernadette: That really happened?"
"9","Stuart: I mean, I can’t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I’m alone, the more desperate I get."
"9","Amy: Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity."
"9","Stuart: Okay, we’re all feeling it. Yes, I’ll go out with you."
"9","Amy: Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense."
"9","Scene: A sports bar."
"9","Leonard: I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems."
"9","Leonard: If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory."
"9","Howard: Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl."
"9","Sheldon: That’s ridiculous."
"9","Raj: Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you."
"9","Sheldon: True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia."
"9","Leonard: Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?"
"9","Sheldon: There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend."
"9","Raj: Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work."
"9","Sheldon: You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks."
"9","Raj: How many sips of that beer did he have?"
"9","Leonard: Three."
"9","Howard: Oh, boy."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you."
"9","Woman: What?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s a Pokémon reference."
"9","Woman: I don’t know what that means."
"9","Sheldon: Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?"
"9","Older woman: I’m married, and I’m her grandmother."
"9","Sheldon: Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Bernadette: Stuart took that rejection like a pro."
"9","Penny: Well, he knew he was on the breast cam."
"9","Amy: I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over."
"9","Penny: And sometimes we marry them anyway."
"9","Amy (Phone text sound): Huh. Well, this is weird."
"9","(Phone text sound)"
"9","Penny: What?"
"9","Amy: Barry Kripke just asked me out."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day."
"9","Penny: I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows."
"9","Bernadette: What did he say?"
"9","Amy: Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime."
"9","Penny: Well, what are you gonna do?"
"9","Amy: I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast."
"9","Bernadette: What can it hurt?"
"9","Amy: Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon."
"9","Bernadette: You mean, not a scientist?"
"9","Penny: I think she means not a weirdo."
"9","Bernadette: Are you attracted to him?"
"9","Amy: I don’t know."
"9","Penny: All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?"
"9","Amy: Oh, I don’t have to imagine it."
"9","Scene: The stairwell."
"9","Sheldon: I smell funny. I taste salty."
"9","Leonard: You’re just sweaty from exercise."
"9","Sheldon: And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me."
"9","Leonard: I know it only takes one doctor’s finger."
"9","Amy: Hello."
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Leonard: We should let you guys talk."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: You don’t have to leave."
"9","Leonard: Look at me go."
"9","Amy: Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride."
"9","Bernadette: Walk."
"9","Amy: How have you been?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today."
"9","Amy: How’d that go?"
"9","Sheldon: It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out."
"9","Amy: Well, actually, he, he already did."
"9","Sheldon: Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man."
"9","Amy: I said no."
"9","Sheldon: Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no."
"9","Amy: I didn’t know you were interested in dating."
"9","Sheldon: I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on."
"9","Amy: Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good."
"9","Sheldon: Thanks. And I taste good too."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"9","Bernadette: Howie?"
"9","Howard: What’s up?"
"9","Bernadette: Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?"
"9","Series 09 Episode 06 – The Helium Insufficiency"
"9","Scene: Leonard’s lab."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, I’ve got terrible news."
"9","Leonard: What’s going on?"
"9","Sheldon: Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical."
"9","Leonard: Just tell me."
"9","Sheldon: A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment."
"9","Leonard: Oh, well, that kind of stinks."
"9","Sheldon: That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting."
"9","Leonard: What are we going to do?"
"9","Sheldon: Perform the experiment immediately."
"9","Leonard: I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month."
"9","Sheldon: A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow."
"9","Leonard: That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you. Aren’t you sweet."
"9","Leonard: Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve."
"9","Sheldon: Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?"
"9","Scene: Barry Kripke’s office."
"9","Leonard: Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?"
"9","Barry: Sowwy, there’s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study."
"9","Sheldon: But you won’t need much for that."
"9","Barry: Twue, but if it’s successful, I’m having a pawty with bawwoons."
"9","Leonard: Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?"
"9","Barry: Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?"
"9","Leonard: Yes."
"9","Sheldon: Not a chance."
"9","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"9","Sheldon: He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So, what do you say?"
"9","Barry: Hell no."
"9","Sheldon: He could’ve softened the blow."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Raj: Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?"
"9","Leonard: We’d have to go to every Party City in California."
"9","Howard: Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo."
"9","Raj: Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball."
"9","Howard: If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions."
"9","Leonard: Who is he?"
"9","Sheldon: Where does he work?"
"9","Leonard: How does he get the helium?"
"9","Sheldon: How many questions are too many questions?"
"9","Howard: Maybe he’s not for you."
"9","Sheldon: Four questions. There answer’s four."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Bernadette: Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart."
"9","Penny: Oh, good for him."
"9","Bernadette: I thought so, too."
"9","Penny: So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?"
"9","Bernadette: He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone."
"9","Penny: Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it."
"9","Bernadette: I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game."
"9","Penny: Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart."
"9","Stuart: What’s up?"
"9","Bernadette: Can you show us that dating app?"
"9","Stuart: Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life."
"9","Penny: Wow. So how many girls have you met?"
"9","Stuart: Two. I probably don’t need to mention there’s an entire number between that and zero."
"9","Penny: Well, so how does it work?"
"9","Stuart: Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don’t, thumbs down."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?"
"9","Stuart: First time it happens I will let you know."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Leonard: Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy."
"9","Sheldon: What’s he say?"
"9","Leonard: He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight."
"9","Sheldon: Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?"
"9","Leonard: The man restocking the cereal shelves."
"9","Sheldon: That’s right. And what did he do?"
"9","Leonard: He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch."
"9","Sheldon: It’s like it was yesterday."
"9","Leonard: Do you want liquid helium or not?"
"9","Sheldon: Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us."
"9","Leonard: Then I’m going to tell him we’re in."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical."
"9","Leonard: We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys."
"9","Sheldon: Was she helping him with his research?"
"9","Leonard: Sure. So, are we doing this?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, but where does he get the helium?"
"9","Leonard: Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?"
"9","Sheldon: Uh, but this is violating university code."
"9","Leonard: A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man."
"9","Sheldon: Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in."
"9","Leonard: Done."
"9","Sheldon: I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?"
"9","Leonard: Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better."
"9","Sheldon: Aren’t you just made of sugar."
"9","Amy: I’m not sure how I feel about this."
"9","Penny: Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it."
"9","Stuart: One of which would’ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set."
"9","Penny: Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute."
"9","Bernadette: Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?"
"9","Penny: And he’s sad about it."
"9","Howard: Hey."
"9","Raj: Hello."
"9","Penny: Hey."
"9","Bernadette: Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?"
"9","Howard: If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money."
"9","Raj: What are you guys up to?"
"9","Bernadette: We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there."
"9","Raj: Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not."
"9","Howard: What was wrong with that guy?"
"9","Raj: Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out."
"9","Howard: Hey, I want to try."
"9","Amy: Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?"
"9","Howard: Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?"
"9","Scene: A parking garage."
"9","Leonard: That must be him."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Man: What’s up?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…"
"9","Sheldon: I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh."
"9","Man: Great. You got the cash?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, yeah, uh, right here."
"9","Sheldon: Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?"
"9","Leonard: What ya doing, Skippy?"
"9","Sheldon: Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first."
"9","Man: Oh, how do I know you’re not gonna drive away without paying me?"
"9","Sheldon: Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas."
"9","Leonard: Look, you can trust us. We’re respected scientists."
"9","Sheldon: Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage."
"9","Man: Yeah, well, from my perspective, that’s how you two appear to me."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?"
"9","Leonard: My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front."
"9","Man: Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we’re at a, uh, stalemate."
"9","Sheldon: Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination."
"9","Man: Huh. All these years I’ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish."
"9","Leonard: I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?"
"9","Man: Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that."
"9","Sheldon: Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm."
"9","Man: Hmm, I don’t follow."
"9","Sheldon: Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities."
"9","Man: Is that a threat?"
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it."
"9","Man: Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I’ll report you, then I’ll pound your asses into the ground."
"9","Sheldon: Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?"
"9","Leonard: Afraid so, Skippy."
"9","Sheldon: I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night."
"9","Leonard: All right, let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody."
"9","Man: No, I don’t like this. I’m out."
"9","Leonard: No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year."
"9","Man: Really? What’s the hypothesis?"
"9","Sheldon: Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
"9","Man: Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on."
"9","Leonard: Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium."
"9","Sheldon: And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody."
"9","Leonard: Here’s the money. Can we do this?"
"9","Man: Okay. It’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden."
"9","Leonard: It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it."
"9","Man: Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there’s, uh, plenty we could do about it."
"9","Sheldon: Did you hear that, Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?"
"9","Penny: Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?"
"9","Raj: You know he won’t be looking at other girls."
"9","Howard: Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose."
"9","Penny: Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next."
"9","Bernadette: Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin."
"9","Penny: Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish."
"9","Howard: I love you, Amy. (Dolphin noises)"
"9","(Dolphin noises)"
"9","Amy: Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?"
"9","Raj: That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face."
"9","Penny: Look, it’s Stuart."
"9","Raj: You may want to leave the room."
"9","Sheldon: Right this way, Uncle Harvey."
"9","Leonard: Will you stop with that already?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m trying not to attract attention."
"9","Leonard: And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?"
"9","Sheldon: She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?"
"9","Leonard: Let’s just start the experiment."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught."
"9","Leonard: We’re not getting caught."
"9","Sheldon: Well, you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?"
"9","Leonard: The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up."
"9","Sheldon: Uh-oh."
"9","Leonard: What?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, did you see this sticker?"
"9","Leonard: What is it?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U."
"9","Leonard: It’s probably USC or UCLA."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime."
"9","Leonard: Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U."
"9","Sheldon: That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail."
"9","Leonard: Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules."
"9","Scene: A university corridor."
"9","Leonard: Ma’am."
"9","Penny: Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull."
"9","Raj: I have that same underwear."
"9","Penny: Chug."
"9","Penny: Amy, you’re getting a text."
"9","Amy: Oh, um, give me that."
"9","Raj: I had a great time last night."
"9","Amy: No, no, stop reading that."
"9","Howard: Who’s Dave?"
"9","Penny: You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?"
"9","Amy: No, it, it’s not like that."
"9","Bernadette: And I’d love to take you out again”?"
"9","All: Amy/What?/Can’t believe it/Oh, my God."
"9","Amy: Okay, it’s like that."
"9","Scene: The parking garage."
"9","Leonard: Thank you for coming back."
"9","Man: Yeah, well, normally I wouldn’t, but my daughter’s having a sleepover, and there’s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take."
"9","Sheldon: Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way."
"9","Man: Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?"
"9","Leonard: No, nothing. We just changed our mind."
"9","Sheldon: He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison."
"9","Man: Yeah, I hear you. Well, you’re good guys, so I’ll, uh, I’ll take the helium off your hands."
"9","Leonard: Thank you."
"9","Man: But you ain’t getting your money back."
"9","Sheldon: You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together."
"9","Man: Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business."
"9","Leonard: You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this."
"9","Man: No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee."
"9","Sheldon: I don’t understand."
"9","Leonard: He wants more money."
"9","Sheldon: Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me."
"9","Man: That’s exactly how much it is."
"9","Sheldon: Finally, something breaks our way."
"9","Penny: I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?"
"9","Amy: Because it’s new and weird and I’m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it."
"9","Stuart: A few people?"
"9","Bernadette: What?"
"9","Penny: Amy."
"9","Stuart: So, are we allowed to ask how it’s going?"
"9","Amy: It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee."
"9","Raj: What? I thought we were all… never mind."
"9","Bernadette: I, I thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people."
"9","Amy: Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little."
"9","Penny: Well, good for you."
"9","Amy: Thank you."
"9","Bernadette: And how many guys have you gone out with?"
"9","Stuart: Please be less than two."
"9","Amy: Three."
"9","Stuart: Damn it."
"9","Sheldon: Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison."
"9","Leonard: Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?"
"9","Sheldon: It scared me straight, Leonard."
"9","Barry: Hey, I’ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium."
"9","Leonard: Thank you, Barry."
"9","Barry: But you have to add my name to your paper."
"9","Sheldon: That’s preposterous."
"9","Barry: I don’t know, seems fair. You can’t do it without me."
"9","Leonard: Can you give us a minute?"
"9","Barry: Take your time. I’ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect."
"9","Sheldon: I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people."
"9","Leonard: Me neither, but what other choice do we have?"
"9","Leonard: I promise this is the last time."
"9","Leonard: It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties."
"9","Sheldon: How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?"
"9","Helium Man: They should’ve used among, right?"
"9","Sheldon: Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic."
"9","Helium Man: All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?"
"9","Sheldon: Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow."
"9","Helium Man: I am open to change."
"9","Series 09 Episode 07 – The Spock Resonance"
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Leonard: Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?"
"9","Raj: Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13."
"9","Penny: In school?"
"9","Raj: Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names."
"9","Penny: Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?"
"9","Leonard: You tell me, you woke up in bed with one."
"9","Sheldon: Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture."
"9","Leonard: Why is he writing to you?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it."
"9","Raj: Oh. Hey, high five."
"9","Sheldon: Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?"
"9","Penny: Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so."
"9","Sheldon: This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Bernadette: Hey. You got a minute?"
"9","Howard: Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now."
"9","Bernadette: Pause the game, Howard."
"9","Howard: Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?"
"9","Bernadette: We need to talk about redecorating this place."
"9","Howard: Oh, no, not this again."
"9","Bernadette: Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too."
"9","Howard: Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?"
"9","Bernadette: All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things."
"9","Howard: May I say something?"
"9","Bernadette: Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?"
"9","Howard: Never mind."
"9","Sheldon (on phone): Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I’m no longer in your life."
"9","(on phone)"
"9","Leonard: I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary."
"9","Penny: And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it."
"9","Sheldon (answering door): Hello."
"9","(answering door):"
"9","Wil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy."
"9","Adam: Nice to meet you."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum."
"9","Wil: I told you. This guy is gold."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"9","Bernadette: Whatcha doing?"
"9","Howard: Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died."
"9","Bernadette: Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house."
"9","Howard: I’m listening."
"9","Bernadette: Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes."
"9","Howard: That is reasonable. But what room?"
"9","Bernadette: How ’bout this one?"
"9","Howard: No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom."
"9","Bernadette: Then how ’bout the bathroom?"
"9","Howard: I want to change my answer."
"9","Bernadette: Fine. Then the dining room."
"9","Howard: I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…"
"9","Bernadette: Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples."
"9","Adam: All right, we’re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera’s not here."
"9","Sheldon: All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt."
"9","Leonard: How long have you known Adam?"
"9","Wil: A few years."
"9","Leonard: And what are you getting him back for?"
"9","Adam: Let’s start with your name and occupation."
"9","Sheldon: Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech."
"9","Adam: And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?"
"9","Sheldon: The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine."
"9","Adam: What was it about Spock that appealed to you?"
"9","Sheldon: I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television."
"9","Penny: Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better."
"9","Leonard: My brother was mean to me, too."
"9","Penny: Yeah, you probably had it coming."
"9","Adam: Do you have any Spock collectibles?"
"9","Sheldon: I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there."
"9","Penny: Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on."
"9","Adam: Can we see the napkin?"
"9","Sheldon: Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment."
"9","Leonard: When did we get a wall safe?"
"9","Sheldon: When there was no more room in the floor safe."
"9","Leonard: When did we get a floor safe?"
"9","Sheldon: When we got the security camera."
"9","Leonard: There’s a security camera?"
"9","Sheldon: Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012."
"9","Penny: Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah. You don’t have to tell me."
"9","Raj: So, your father-in-law is in there right now?"
"9","Howard: Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is."
"9","Raj: Oh, okay. Got it."
"9","Howard: Hey. What’s going on?"
"9","Raj: Hey."
"9","Bernadette: Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall."
"9","Raj: You sure? It’s a pretty great wall."
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: What’s so great about it?"
"9","Raj: I’m sorry. I did what I could."
"9","Bernadette: Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?"
"9","Howard: Your dad’s on your side."
"9","Bernadette: He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free."
"9","Raj: That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides."
"9","Howard: Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing."
"9","Raj: Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check."
"9","Howard: When is your visa up?"
"9","Sheldon: Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA."
"9","Wil: Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?"
"9","Sheldon: No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away."
"9","Penny: Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?"
"9","Sheldon: Wouldn’t you like to know?"
"9","Penny: I would."
"9","Sheldon: All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will."
"9","Leonard: You have a will?"
"9","Sheldon: Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil."
"9","Leonard: Will Wil want it?"
"9","Wil: Wil won’t."
"9","Penny: Oh, what’s that ring box?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy."
"9","Penny: What?"
"9","Leonard: You bought her a ring?"
"9","Sheldon: No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it."
"9","Wil: Sheldon, that’s awful."
"9","Sheldon: No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana."
"9","Penny: Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?"
"9","Sheldon: No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject."
"9","Leonard: Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you."
"9","Sheldon: No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best."
"9","Penny: I know. It just…"
"9","Sheldon (shouting): I said I’m fine! (Long pause) We’ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?"
"9","(shouting)"
"9","(Long pause)"
"9","Adam: Did you find that helpful?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe."
"9","Penny: I knew I could smell ’em."
"9","Adam: What about from when you were a kid?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch."
"9","Adam: Did it work?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click."
"9","Adam: That must have been very upsetting for you."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering."
"9","Penny: Oh pfft."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me?"
"9","Penny: I’m sorry. I’m not here."
"9","Sheldon: No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?"
"9","Penny: Um."
"9","Leonard: You did go pfft."
"9","Penny: All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human."
"9","Leonard: Just like you."
"9","Penny: I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else."
"9","Sheldon: Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time."
"9","Penny: Sweetie, you’re yelling."
"9","Sheldon: Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me."
"9","Wil: This documentary is gonna be awesome."
"9","Scene: The crawlspace under Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: You gonna be okay down here?"
"9","Howard: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell."
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: Yeah, that’s a rat skull."
"9","Howard: Oh."
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: Relax. There’s enough droppings down here without you making more."
"9","Howard: Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?"
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: Yeah. I think that’s the den."
"9","Howard: Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room."
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery."
"9","Howard: Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?"
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: ‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids."
"9","Howard: That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids."
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: Huh."
"9","Howard: I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…"
"9","Bernadette (above): Earthquake."
"9","(above)"
"9","Howard: Oh, my God, we’re gonna die."
"9","Bernadette: Aftershock."
"9","Penny: I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him."
"9","Leonard: I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it."
"9","Penny: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Leonard: Hey, buddy. How you doing?"
"9","Sheldon: Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, yeah."
"9","Penny: Definitely."
"9","Sheldon: Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau."
"9","Penny: Do you know what that means?"
"9","Leonard: No."
"9","Penny: Are you telling the truth?"
"9","Leonard: Nirsh."
"9","Sheldon: Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action."
"9","Penny: What are you gonna do?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran."
"9","Leonard: He didn’t meant that."
"9","Bernadette: So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed."
"9","Howard: That would be nice."
"9","Bernadette: I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him."
"9","Howard: But you were okay throwing me under the bus?"
"9","Bernadette: Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it."
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?"
"9","Mr Rostenkowski: This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten."
"9","Raj: It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have."
"9","Howard: Why are you still here?"
"9","Raj: Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper."
"9","Howard: All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different."
"9","Bernadette: Why?"
"9","Howard: Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there."
"9","Bernadette: Okay, I’ll think about it."
"9","Howard: And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?"
"9","Bernadette: It’s an actual I’ll think about it."
"9","Howard: I really believe I’d be a great dad."
"9","Bernadette: I know you would."
"9","Howard: Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?"
"9","Scene: The street. Sheldon sees Amy with another man. He leaves."
"9","Kirk (on screen): Dr. Dana feels he isn’t that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?"
"9","(on screen)"
"9","Spock (on screen): Because she feels. I don’t. All I know is logic."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?"
"9","Leonard: Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life."
"9","Sheldon: Those are very wise words."
"9","Leonard: Thank you."
"9","Sheldon: They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television."
"9","Series 09 Episode 08 – The Mystery Date Observation"
"9","After a “previously on” sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Penny: I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast."
"9","Leonard: Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home."
"9","Penny: Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?"
"9","Leonard: Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal."
"9","Penny: Oh, I don’t want credit for that."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning."
"9","Leonard: You’re in a good mood."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion."
"9","Penny: Oh. Good for you."
"9","Leonard: What brought this on?"
"9","Sheldon: I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."
"9","Penny: And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman."
"9","Sheldon: No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again."
"9","Leonard: Hey, I made French toast sticks."
"9","Sheldon: On oatmeal day?"
"9","Leonard: Ah, I also made oatmeal."
"9","Sheldon: Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like."
"9","Penny: Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you for coming by, gentlemen."
"9","Howard: No problem."
"9","Raj: So what’s up?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again."
"9","Howard: You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness."
"9","Raj: You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man."
"9","Howard: Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy."
"9","Raj: Hey, the jaw wants what it wants."
"9","Sheldon: Gentlemen."
"9","Raj: Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay."
"9","Howard: But what are you looking for?"
"9","Sheldon: All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight."
"9","Howard: Isn’t that a little unreasonable?"
"9","Sheldon: All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Penny: Come on, Amy, show us the dress."
"9","Amy: Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here."
"9","Penny: Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy."
"9","Amy: Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain."
"9","Penny: No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt."
"9","Amy: Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall."
"9","Penny: Ooh."
"9","Bernadette: Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man."
"9","Penny: Yeah, come on, tell us more."
"9","Amy: Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?"
"9","Bernadette: Did you kiss him yet?"
"9","Amy: Just a little peck on the lips."
"9","Penny: Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone."
"9","Amy: Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one."
"9","Penny: All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?"
"9","Bernadette: Tea and basketball?"
"9","Amy: To that new Italian place on Walnut."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, nice."
"9","Amy: I’m gonna go look for other shoes."
"9","Penny: Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard."
"9","Bernadette: Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?"
"9","Penny: We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there."
"9","Bernadette: I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and check the reservation."
"9","Penny: Damn, you’re sneaky."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable."
"9","Howard: I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there."
"9","Sheldon: Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person."
"9","Raj: And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?"
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes."
"9","Howard: If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?"
"9","Sheldon: Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil."
"9","Howard: You seriously think women would fight for you?"
"9","Sheldon: People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?"
"9","Howard: He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes."
"9","Raj: Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would."
"9","Howard: Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist."
"9","Sheldon: And I have the soulful eyes of a cow."
"9","Raj: I don’t know if I’d say you… oh."
"9","Howard: I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates."
"9","Raj: Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information."
"9","Howard: Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment."
"9","Raj: I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it."
"9","Howard: Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize."
"9","Scene: The stairwell."
"9","Leonard: I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie."
"9","Penny: Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date."
"9","Leonard: What? I don’t want to do that."
"9","Penny: What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?"
"9","Leonard: This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see."
"9","Penny: No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see."
"9","Leonard: So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?"
"9","Penny: You’re not curious who she’s out with?"
"9","Leonard: Not really."
"9","Penny: But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy."
"9","Sheldon: That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live."
"9","Howard: Congratulations."
"9","Raj: This is exciting."
"9","Sheldon: Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use."
"9","Howard: Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire."
"9","Sheldon: And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules."
"9","Raj: I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard."
"9","Howard: Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night."
"9","Sheldon: Golly, she sounds too good to be true."
"9","Scene: A restaurant."
"9","Tall British Dave: This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my divorce."
"9","Amy: Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?"
"9","Dave: Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe."
"9","Amy: Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry."
"9","Dave: No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel."
"9","(in the car outside)"
"9","Penny: Hey. So, where are they?"
"9","Bernadette: Across the street, in the left window."
"9","Penny: Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars."
"9","Bernadette: Right here."
"9","Leonard: You just happen to have those in the car?"
"9","Bernadette: Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends."
"9","Leonard: By stalking them?"
"9","Bernadette: No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment."
"9","Penny: Oh, there he is."
"9","Bernadette: He’s cute, right?"
"9","Penny: Yeah."
"9","Leonard: Can I see?"
"9","Penny: What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come."
"9","Leonard: I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun."
"9","Penny: Fine."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone."
"9","Penny: Your what?"
"9","Bernadette: Nothing. Not important."
"9","Dave: So you’ve never been married?"
"9","Amy: No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship."
"9","Dave: Oh. What happened with that?"
"9","Amy: That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be."
"9","Dave: Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?"
"9","Amy: No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech."
"9","Dave: I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What’s his focus?"
"9","Amy: Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you."
"9","Dave: Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?"
"9","Amy: I’m trying not to. Do you know him?"
"9","Dave: No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?"
"9","Penny: He really seems into her."
"9","Bernadette: I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is."
"9","Leonard: Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?"
"9","Bernadette: Why’d you bring him?"
"9","Penny: I had to; we’re married now."
"9","Bernadette: Ugh, I hear that."
"9","Dave: I’m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon."
"9","Amy: Sure, why not?"
"9","Dave: It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?"
"9","Amy: Um about an hour and half."
"9","Dave: Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?"
"9","Amy: Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one."
"9","Dave: Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he’s a genius, and I wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants."
"9","Amy: What was the rest of your question?"
"9","Dave: Do you think you could introduce me to him?"
"9","Amy: Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?"
"9","Dave: You’re right, it’s, it’s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I’d be too nervous. Oh, I don’t know what to do."
"9","Leonard: Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom."
"9","Raj: 37 minutes left until the deadline."
"9","Sheldon: Someone will show."
"9","Howard: And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment."
"9","Raj: Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives."
"9","Raj: Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract."
"9","Sheldon: Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that."
"9","Scene: The restaurant."
"9","Dave: You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford."
"9","Amy: I have a DVD of that lecture."
"9","Dave: Really? Wasn’t it great?"
"9","Amy: Not as a Valentine’s present, no."
"9","Dave: Well, the next time you watch it, I’m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there."
"9","Amy: That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?"
"9","Dave: Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot."
"9","Amy: No, you’re not."
"9","Dave: Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won’t mention."
"9","Amy: Thank you."
"9","Dave: That you said you might introduce me to, I’m free on Thursday."
"9","Bernadette: Hey, hey, they’re leaving."
"9","Penny: What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they’re coming right towards us."
"9","Bernadette: We got to get out of here."
"9","Penny: Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?"
"9","Bernadette: He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. (Reverses into car behind)"
"9","(Reverses into car behind)"
"9","Penny: Oh, no."
"9","Dave: She just hit my car."
"9","Amy: What are you guys doing here?"
"9","Bernadette: Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?"
"9","Leonard: What happened?"
"9","Dave: O-M-G. Aren’t you Leonard Hofstadter?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah."
"9","Dave: I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It’s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
"9","Amy: No. Pinch me."
"9","Dave: It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?"
"9","Leonard: I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind."
"9","Dave: Amy, I’m never washing this hand again."
"9","Leonard: You really should."
"9","Raj: Sixty seconds. This is not looking good."
"9","Sheldon: One minute is a long time."
"9","Howard: I’ve been telling women that for 20 years."
"9","Raj: Forty-five."
"9","Sheldon: 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes."
"9","Raj: Thirty seconds."
"9","Sheldon: Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?"
"9","Howard: What?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea."
"9","Howard: You thought she was great in X-Men."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence."
"9","Raj: Guys, fifteen seconds."
"9","Howard: Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment."
"9","Sheldon: Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence."
"9","Raj: Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad."
"9","Howard: Maybe we did make the test too difficult."
"9","Raj: I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because… (knock on door) we are the dreamers of dreams."
"9","(knock on door)"
"9","Howard: It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty."
"9","Raj: Answer it."
"9","Sheldon: All right. Can I help you?"
"9","Girl: Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes."
"9","Girl: Hi. I’m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I’ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before."
"9","Sheldon: Careful, it’s addictive."
"9","Vanessa: Chija”e’vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva."
"9","Sheldon: And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie."
"9","Vanessa: Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don’t need to tell you, there aren’t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world."
"9","Sheldon: I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing."
"9","Raj: How could you send her away?"
"9","Sheldon: She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals."
"9","Scene: Amy’s car."
"9","Dave: Uh, thanks for driving me home."
"9","Amy: No problem. I’m really sorry about your car."
"9","Dave: Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love to take you out again."
"9","Amy: Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out."
"9","Dave: Oh. Okay."
"9","Amy: I’m, I’m really sorry."
"9","Dave: No, it’s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me."
"9","Amy: There you go."
"9","Dave: If I ever do meet him, we’ll have that in common."
"9","Amy: Sure. Heh."
"9","Dave: And, he’s kissed you and I’ve kissed you, so if you think about it…"
"9","Amy: Okay, get out."
"9","Series 09 Episode 09 – The Platonic Permutation"
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Raj: Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?"
"9","Howard: No. How does it work?"
"9","Raj: You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?"
"9","Siri: The time is 6:37 p.m."
"9","Howard: So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
"9","Raj: Nice try. It only recognizes my voice."
"9","Howard: Oh. Cool. (In thick Indian accent) Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
"9","(In thick Indian accent)"
"9","Raj: I don’t sound like that."
"9","Siri: Here are some images of naked grandma butts."
"9","Sheldon: Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won’t be going alone, I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?"
"9","Leonard: Well, we’re having everyone over."
"9","Penny: Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day."
"9","Leonard: Otherwise we’d love to."
"9","Penny: But we can’t."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, poor us."
"9","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"9","Bernadette: And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless."
"9","Sheldon: Well, Howard, what about you?"
"9","Howard: Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too."
"9","Bernadette: You said that sounded like the worst thing ever."
"9","Howard: If you can’t support me when I’m lying, why are we married?"
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Amy (on skype): Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?"
"9","(on skype)"
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets."
"9","Amy: No one can go with you?"
"9","Sheldon: No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like."
"9","Amy: Oh. Okay. Thank you."
"9","Sheldon: And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends."
"9","Sheldon: You don’t think that will be awkward?"
"9","Amy: Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it’ll be fine."
"9","Sheldon: Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning."
"9","Amy: See you then."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short."
"9","Amy: Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?"
"9","Sheldon: And there goes my list."
"9","Scene: Outside the soup kitchen."
"9","Emily: So, how does this work?"
"9","Bernadette: The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours."
"9","Howard: Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long."
"9","Raj: Do you ever do anything for anyone else?"
"9","Howard: I happen to be a giving and generous lover."
"9","Emily: Are you and I close enough for me to say that’s creepy?"
"9","Bernadette: We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh."
"9","Soup Kitchen Manager: Uh, can I help you?"
"9","Bernadette: Hi. We’d like to volunteer."
"9","Soup Kitchen Manager: Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face."
"9","Howard: Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate."
"9","Emily: Are you and I close enough for me to say…"
"9","Bernadette: That he’s an ass? He beat you to it."
"9","Soup Kitchen Manager: I was wrong. A large group had to cancel."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, great. We’d love to help."
"9","Howard: Wipe that smug smile off your face."
"9","Bernadette: I can’t."
"9","Penny: Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife."
"9","Leonard: I know. I feel so grown up."
"9","Penny: Sweetie, you are grown up."
"9","Leonard: Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?"
"9","Penny: Yep. What’s the code?"
"9","Leonard: My birthday."
"9","Penny: It’s not working."
"9","Leonard: It’s just the four digits, month and day."
"9","Penny: Nope."
"9","Leonard: Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?"
"9","Penny: Uh."
"9","Leonard: You don’t know my birthday, do you?"
"9","Penny: Yes, I do."
"9","Leonard: Well, what is it?"
"9","Penny: May."
"9","Leonard: May what?"
"9","Penny: I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure."
"9","Leonard: You don’t know your own husband’s birthday."
"9","Penny: Well, you don’t know everything about me."
"9","Leonard: Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero."
"9","Penny: Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife."
"9","Scene: Amy’s car."
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Amy: Hi. Ready for the aquarium?"
"9","Sheldon: I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation."
"9","Amy: If that makes you more comfortable."
"9","Sheldon: If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"
"9","Amy: No. You?"
"9","Sheldon: No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?"
"9","Amy: I might go visit my aunt next week."
"9","Sheldon: Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?"
"9","Amy: No, the one in Bakersfield."
"9","Sheldon: Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?"
"9","Scene: The soup kitchen."
"9","Soup Kitchen Manager: We’re gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I’ll be around."
"9","Howard: So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?"
"9","Bernadette: What difference does it make?"
"9","Howard: I don’t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more."
"9","Raj: You’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!"
"9","Howard: It’s not like I’m expecting them to sing."
"9","Sheldon: and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78."
"9","Amy: Are we done discussing the weather?"
"9","Sheldon: I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use."
"9","Amy: Sheldon. We’ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet."
"9","Sheldon: All right. Well, what should we talk about?"
"9","Amy: I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind."
"9","Sheldon: Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?"
"9","Amy: Man, I walked right into that one."
"9","Leonard: Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog."
"9","Penny: Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?"
"9","Leonard: Baby."
"9","Penny: Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?"
"9","Leonard: Justin."
"9","Penny: Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?"
"9","Leonard: Nice try. NSYNC forever."
"9","Penny: Damn it."
"9","Leonard: Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…"
"9","Penny: Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?"
"9","Leonard: Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot."
"9","Penny: Interesting. I never told you that."
"9","Leonard: Sure you did."
"9","Penny: No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal."
"9","Leonard: What? I didn’t know you had a journal."
"9","Penny: I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying."
"9","Leonard: No, it doesn’t."
"9","Raj: You know, this reminds me of high school."
"9","Emily: You worked in a restaurant?"
"9","Raj: No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny."
"9","Howard: All right, I think I’m getting into a groove here. This isn’t so bad."
"9","Emly: Only five hours and 40 minutes to go."
"9","Howard: We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?"
"9","Raj: You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes."
"9","Howard: Just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid."
"9","Raj: No, seriously. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It’s about, it’s about simply being."
"9","Howard: Huh. Okay, I’ll try it."
"9","Soup Kitchen Manager: I need three people out front."
"9","Bernadette: I’ll do it."
"9","Raj: Me."
"9","Emily: Right here!"
"9","Howard: No fair, I was meditating."
"9","Leonard: Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident."
"9","Penny: How can reading my journal be an accident?"
"9","Leonard: I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up."
"9","Penny: Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?"
"9","Leonard: You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm."
"9","Penny: All right. Let’s just finish cooking."
"9","Leonard: Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote."
"9","Penny: Okay, really, I’m fine."
"9","Leonard: Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny."
"9","Penny: Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote."
"9","Leonard: Fine. Mmm, Penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”"
"9","Penny: Does it really say that?"
"9","Leonard: Why would I lie?"
"9","Penny: OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?"
"9","Leonard: Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah."
"9","Sheldon: I’m sensing things have gotten awkward."
"9","Amy: No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything."
"9","Sheldon: All right."
"9","Amy: So, you had some questions about me seeing other people."
"9","Sheldon: Just a few."
"9","Amy: Go ahead."
"9","Sheldon: How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry."
"9","Amy: Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment."
"9","Sheldon: Is that regular or honey nut?"
"9","Amy: I mixed them."
"9","Sheldon: You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?"
"9","Amy: Just one. Are you doing okay?"
"9","Sheldon: I am."
"9","Amy: Good. I want you to be happy."
"9","Sheldon: I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here."
"9","Man: Here you go."
"9","Howard: Thanks. You got to be kidding me."
"9","Man: Sorry?"
"9","Howard: Y, you’re Elon Musk."
"9","Elon: I am."
"9","Howard: Wh, what are you doing here?"
"9","Elon: I’m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy."
"9","Howard: Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I’m, I’m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech."
"9","Elon: Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?"
"9","Howard: Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer."
"9","Elon: And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick."
"9","Howard: Sorry. It’s just, you’re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me."
"9","Elon: Well, you’re here on Thanksgiving, so you’re probably a good person."
"9","Howard: Oh. I made my wife come down, too."
"9","Elon: You think you might ever get back out to space?"
"9","Howard: Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on."
"9","Elon: Well, we’re not quite there yet, but we’re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch."
"9","Howard: Thank you."
"9","Elon: Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?"
"9","Howard: A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do."
"9","Scene: The aquarium."
"9","Sheldon: You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad."
"9","Amy: You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats."
"9","Sheldon: They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake."
"9","Amy: Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?"
"9","Amy: Sure. What is it?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle."
"9","Amy: So it’s like Kiss, Marry, Kill."
"9","Sheldon: What is that?"
"9","Amy: It’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill."
"9","Sheldon: Well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them."
"9","Amy: Let’s just play."
"9","Sheldon: I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp."
"9","Amy: Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated."
"9","Sheldon: Very well done."
"9","Amy: Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?"
"9","Amy: But you can pal around with a hagfish?"
"9","Sheldon: Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish."
"9","Amy: Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute."
"9","Sheldon: I know. It makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down."
"9","Amy: I miss this."
"9","Sheldon: How can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?"
"9","Amy: I guess sometimes I’m silly."
"9","Penny: Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done."
"9","Leonard: Be right there. Hi, lover."
"9","Penny: What are you doing?"
"9","Leonard: I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook."
"9","Penny: I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it."
"9","Leonard: Don’t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?"
"9","Penny: Oh."
"9","Leonard: Huh? Some of this? And, since it’s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?"
"9","Bernadette: Happy Thanks… Yikes."
"9","Leonard: I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy."
"9","Sheldon: Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends."
"9","Penny: Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. (Phone rings) Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello."
"9","(Phone rings)"
"9","Amy: Hi, Sheldon. I’m just driving home from my mother’s."
"9","Sheldon: Did you have a nice time?"
"9","Amy: I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way."
"9","Amy: It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. I thought we were just friends."
"9","Amy: We are. But I was hoping, maybe…"
"9","Sheldon: Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend."
"9","Amy: Okay. I understand."
"9","Sheldon: Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob."
"9","Amy: Okay. Sure."
"9","Series 09 Episode 10 – The Earworm Reverberation"
"9","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"9","Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is."
"9","Scene: The apartment. 2 days earlier."
"9","Leonard: Since when do you hum songs?"
"9","Sheldon: What are you talking about?"
"9","Leonard: You were just humming."
"9","Sheldon: Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise."
"9","Leonard: How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?"
"9","Sheldon: Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?"
"9","Leonard: Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?"
"9","Sheldon (singing): Who lives in a pineapple. Nope."
"9","(singing)"
"9","Leonard: Whatever. Can we just get back to this?"
"9","Sheldon: I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put my finger on it. (Singing) My country, ’tis of thee. No."
"9","(Singing)"
"9","Leonard: It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you."
"9","Sheldon: Okay. (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No."
"9","Leonard: Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?"
"9","Sheldon (singing): I’m surprised you have to ask."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon (on phone): Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all."
"9","(on phone)"
"9","Leonard: Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service."
"9","Penny: Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me."
"9","Penny: I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself."
"9","Sheldon: I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity."
"9","Penny: Public nudity?"
"9","Leonard: Eh, that just means going barefoot."

"9","Dave (voice on phone): Hello?"
"9","(voice on phone)"
"9","Amy: Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy."
"9","Dave: Oh. How are you?"
"9","Amy: I’m fine. How are you?"
"9","Dave: Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date."
"9","Amy: Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend."
"9","Dave: So, to what do I owe the pleasure?"
"9","Amy: Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime."
"9","Dave: Yes, please."
"9","Amy: Great."
"9","Dave: Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule."
"9","Amy: How ’bout Saturday?"
"9","Dave: Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers’ market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works."
"9","Scene: Howard’s workshop."
"9","Raj: Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?"
"9","Howard: Really? Why?"
"9","Raj: They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization."
"9","Howard: Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?"
"9","Raj: Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…"
"9","Howard: Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?"
"9","Raj: It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up."
"9","Howard: That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo."
"9","Raj: But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan."
"9","Howard: All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together."
"9","Raj: So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this."
"9","Howard: We did raise the roof that night."
"9","Raj: Yeah, we totally did."
"9","Howard: Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?"
"9","Sheldon (singing): Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong."
"9","Leonard: Put on some headphones."
"9","Sheldon (singing): No they make my earlobes sweat."
"9","Penny: Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?"
"9","Sheldon: There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting."
"9","Penny: Okay, great. What is it?"
"9","Sheldon: I’ll show you. (Into phone camera) Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn’t listen. Oh, wait. (Singing) Everyody cut footloose. Nope."
"9","(Into phone camera)"
"9","Penny: I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose."
"9","Sheldon: This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway."
"9","Bernadette: So, you’re really going out with Dave again?"
"9","Amy: Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy."
"9","Bernadette: But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon."
"9","Amy: That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again."
"9","Bernadette: Okay. So where’s he taking you?"
"9","Amy: Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. That’s a big step."
"9","Amy: It is?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live."
"9","Amy: You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need."
"9","Bernadette: You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?"
"9","Amy: Why not?"
"9","Bernadette: ‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus."
"9","Raj: Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him."
"9","Howard: What should we write?"
"9","Raj: How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon."
"9","Howard: Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma."
"9","Raj: Well what do you want to write?"
"9","Howard: Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’."
"9","Raj: Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now."
"9","Howard: I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that."
"9","Raj: Okay. I posted it."
"9","Howard: So, who is this guy?"
"9","Raj: Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco."
"9","Howard: Cool name."
"9","Raj: Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too."
"9","Howard: Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment."
"9","Raj: He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him."
"9","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon is playing his tune on a keyboard in the background."
"9","Penny: Oh, my God, he won’t stop."
"9","Leonard: How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?"
"9","Penny: Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?"
"9","Leonard: Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once."
"9","Penny: Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?"
"9","Leonard: What do you want, a medal? It was your gum."
"9","Penny: Fine."
"9","Leonard: I love you."
"9","Penny: Who cares?"
"9","Sheldon (off): What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s mine. Why are you so strong?"
"9","(off)"
"9","Penny: Problem solved."
"9","Leonard: Oh, yeah, he got a tuba."
"9","Sheldon: Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much."
"9","Leonard: Hey, can we please get back to work?"
"9","Sheldon: This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world."
"9","Leonard: All right, just stop. This is ridiculous."
"9","Sheldon: Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list."
"9","Leonard: Thank you."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, no, he’s drinking it."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Howard: Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle."
"9","Raj: That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work."
"9","Bernadette: Who’s Trent?"
"9","Howard: Oh, he’s our fan."
"9","Bernadette: Fan of what?"
"9","Howard: Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band."
"9","Bernadette: You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?"
"9","Howard: And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave."
"9","Raj: Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks."
"9","Howard: Really? You want to go down there and meet him?"
"9","Bernadette: Are you stalking him? That’s creepy."
"9","Raj: It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it."
"9","Howard: After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle."
"9","Raj: From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement."
"9","Howard: So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy."
"9","Bernadette: Maybe I should marry Trent."
"9","Raj: Yeah, like she could get Trent."
"9","Dave: This is delicious."
"9","Amy: Thank you."
"9","Dave: Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal."
"9","Amy: When you were married, did your wife cook?"
"9","Dave: Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen."
"9","Amy: So, a little silver lining."
"9","Dave: I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?"
"9","Amy: Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know."
"9","Dave: I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care."
"9","Amy: Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere."
"9","Dave: Had to or got to? Sorry."
"9","Amy: My fault. I brought him up."
"9","Dave: Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?"
"9","Sheldon: Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?"
"9","Leonard: That’s a trick question, right?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness."
"9","Penny: Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems."
"9","Leonard: Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you."
"9","Sheldon: Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back."
"9","Penny: Maybe he just had bread in his pocket."
"9","Sheldon: The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride."
"9","(Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys)"
"9","Leonard: There goes our shot at him living on the roof."
"9","Scene: A coffee shop."
"9","Raj: So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?"
"9","Howard: No. Let him spot us."
"9","Raj: I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now."
"9","Howard: Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band."
"9","Raj: And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!"
"9","Howard: I can’t watch."
"9","Raj: It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done."
"9","Howard: Why is he looking at it?"
"9","Raj: Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?"
"9","Howard: Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah."
"9","Raj: Ooh!"
"9","Howard: Let’s just go."
"9","Trent: Hey, aren’t you the guys?"
"9","Howard: Nope."
"9","Raj: No, never heard of ’em!"
"9","Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is listening to Darlin’"
"9","Sheldon: I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head."
"9","Leonard: I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy."
"9","Penny: Do you even like the Beach Boys?"
"9","Sheldon: They have beach right in the name. What do you think?"
"9","Leonard: Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?"
"9","Sheldon: Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head."
"9","Penny: Why?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s about Amy."
"9","Penny: Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her."
"9","Sheldon: It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”"
"9","Penny: She did soften your life, didn’t she?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go."
"9","Leonard: Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?"
"9","Penny: Better. You’re the lint trap of my love."
"9","Leonard: Aw."
"9","Amy: That’s an interesting tie clip."
"9","Dave: Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it."
"9","Amy: No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh."
"9","Dave: Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control."
"9","Amy: No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous."
"9","Dave: Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land."
"9","Amy: You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?"
"9","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"9","Amy: That’s Sheldon."
"9","Dave: You’re kidding. How’s my hair?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time."
"9","Sheldon: I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind."
"9","Amy: What?"
"9","Dave: If I may, I believe what he’s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don’t mind me."
"9","Sheldon: I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date."
"9","Amy: No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?"
"9","Sheldon: Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend."
"9","Amy: I really want that, too."
"9","Sheldon: Good. Because I love you."
"9","Amy: I love you, too."
"9","Dave: Kiss her, you brilliant fool."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’ll let you get back to your date."
"9","Amy: Get back here."
"9","Dave: Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening."

"9","Caption: THE OPENING NIGHT EXCITATION"
"9","Caption: It is a period of great tension. Our heroes, Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Koothrappali know that tickets to the new Star Wars movie are about to be available for pre-sale."
"9","Caption: If they fail in their mission and can’t see it on opening night Sheldon has sworn that they will never hear the end of it for the rest of their lives…"
"9","Caption: They believe him."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Leonard: Guys, tickets already went on sale."
"9","Sheldon: What?"
"9","Howard: They’re not supposed to be available yet."
"9","Leonard: I don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale."
"9","Raj: Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?"
"9","Leonard: No, it’s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier."
"9","Sheldon: The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, me, too."
"9","Howard: Same here!"
"9","Raj: Guys, they’re gonna sell out."
"9","Howard: What are we gonna do?!"
"9","Sheldon: All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist."
"9","Howard: Got ’em."
"9","Sheldon: And I will continue to do so!"
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Penny: I’m really happy you and Amy are back together."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, thank you."
"9","Leonard: I’m also really happy, but I can’t pretend it’s for you. New Star Wars in three days."
"9","Sheldon: Hey, Thursday can’t get here soon enough. I’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee."
"9","Penny: Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday."
"9","Sheldon: And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed."
"9","Penny: You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday."
"9","Leonard: I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day."
"9","Sheldon: But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise, she’s even older. Who saw that coming?"
"9","Penny: Aw, that’s nice. Put that on her cake."
"9","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"9","Arthur: Oh, great. This again."
"9","Sheldon: Arthur, what brings you back?"
"9","Arthur: Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn’t a, a sex dream."
"9","Sheldon: In the past, you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma."
"9","Arthur: And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What’s, what’s troubling you?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie."
"9","Arthur: Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?"
"9","Sheldon: Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy."
"9","Arthur: And they, they, they don’t wear underwear."
"9","Sheldon: So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?"
"9","Arthur: Uh, do, do you love this girl?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me."
"9","Arthur: Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you."
"9","Sheldon: By seeing the movie she’d want me to see?"
"9","Arthur: Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her."
"9","Sheldon: You’re right."
"9","Arthur: Great."
"9","Sheldon: Where are you going?"
"9","Arthur: I don’t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants."
"9","Scene: Amy’s bedroom."
"9","Amy (answering phone): Sheldon, what’s wrong?"
"9","(answering phone)"
"9","Sheldon: I wanted to let you know I’ll be spending your birthday with you."
"9","Amy: Okay."
"9","Sheldon: See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you."
"9","Amy: Obi-what?"
"9","Sheldon: I’ll, I’ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night."
"9","Amy: Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s late. Got to go. Bye."
"9","Raj: Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday."
"9","Leonard: I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him."
"9","Howard: Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together. (all laugh)"
"9","(all laugh)"
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Leonard: Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?"
"9","Sheldon: No, I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy."
"9","Leonard: You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us."
"9","Sheldon (to Howard): This is my ticket to Star Wars…."
"9","(to Howard)"
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
"9","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"9","Bernadette: What happens if I say, come in?"
"9","Penny: Well, find out."
"9","Bernadette: Come in."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette."
"9","Penny: Come in."
"9","Sheldon: Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be."
"9","Bernadette: Just come in."
"9","Sheldon: For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I’ll stream it on Netflix."
"9","Penny: We’re sorry. What do you need?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, as you know, I’ll be celebrating Amy’s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift."
"9","Bernadette: Sure."
"9","Sheldon: Well, so far, I’ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic."
"9","Penny: Wow. You can really arrange that?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it’s your birthday at Bennigan’s, they make a fuss. I don’t see why the Philharmonic would be any different."
"9","Bernadette: How about something a little more realistic?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival."
"9","Penny: Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga."
"9","Bernadette: Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin."
"9","Sheldon: No, no, no, no. She’d be going alone. Well, if you think I’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep."
"9","Penny: Okay, well, what’s the third option?"
"9","Sheldon: That I have coitus with her."
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Leonard: What do you think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart?"
"9","Raj: I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?"
"9","Howard: It’s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup."
"9","Leonard: He’s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?"
"9","Stuart: My, uh, my doctor’s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?"
"9","Leonard: Well…"
"9","Wil Wheaton: Hey, you guys."
"9","Howard: Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?"
"9","Wil: Absolutely."
"9","Stuart: Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder."
"9","Penny: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s, let’s just recap our options. All right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing."
"9","Bernadette: Wild thang."
"9","Sheldon: Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left."
"9","Penny: Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, are you ready for this?"
"9","Sheldon: Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time."
"9","Penny: Sheldon, that’s so beautiful."
"9","Sheldon: Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals."
"9","Scene: The stairwell."
"9","Amy: Thanks for taking me out."
"9","Penny: Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?"
"9","Bernadette: So where do you want to go?"
"9","Amy: I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good."
"9","Penny: Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax."
"9","Amy: Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?"
"9","Penny: Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought."
"9","Amy: I think I’ll just stick to Mexican."
"9","Bernadette: Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them."
"9","Amy: Okay, what is going on?"
"9","Penny: Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow."
"9","Amy: What surprises?"
"9","Bernadette: We don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he’s ready to be physical."
"9","Amy: You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?"
"9","Penny: Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him."
"9","Amy: I, I can’t believe it. I, I don’t know what to say."
"9","Bernadette: Well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…"
"9","Amy: I do know what to say. Let’s get me waxed."
"9","Arthur: Why isn’t it ever Angie Dickinson’s bedroom?"
"9","Sheldon: You’re back."
"9","Arthur: It, it doesn’t seem like it’s up to me."
"9","Sheldon: I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I’ve never done that before."
"9","Arthur: Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot."
"9","Sheldon: So, can you help me?"
"9","Arthur: Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics."
"9","Arthur: Oh, good, good. ‘Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts."
"9","Sheldon: I think they say junk."
"9","Arthur: What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?"
"9","Sheldon: This is an important night for us, and I’m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything."
"9","Arthur: Sheldon, if, if you’re with the right person, it, it’ll be okay."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise."
"9","Arthur: Well, that’s, that’s very nice of you to say, but I think I’m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, sure. Well, you’re fun to look at."
"9","Raj: Tonight’s the night."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, the wait is finally over."
"9","Penny: I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it."
"9","Howard: Ready to go?"
"9","Raj: Let’s do this."
"9","Penny: Have fun, guys."
"9","Leonard: We will."
"9","Raj: I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up."
"9","Howard: I know."
"9","Leonard: We’re gonna have so much more fun than him."
"9","Bernadette: No, they’re not."
"9","Penny: Knowing them, they will."
"9","Scene: The cinema."
"9","Howard: T minus 15 minutes."
"9","Raj: Oh, did you hear from Wil?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah, he’s on his way. Time for bladder check."
"9","Raj: Check."
"9","Leonard: Check."
"9","Howard: Check. Wait. Screw it. I’m holding it."
"9","Raj: What is everyone booing at?"
"9","Wil: Hey, guys. What’s up?"
"9","Leonard: Um, hey, Wil. What you doin’?"
"9","Wil: I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team."
"9","Man: Star Trek stinks!"
"9","Wil: Yeah? Live long and suck it."
"9","Scene: Amy’s apartment."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl."
"9","Amy: Come in."
"9","Sheldon: Oh."
"9","Amy: Hi, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Hello. Sorry I’m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while."
"9","Amy: That’s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I’ll, I’m gonna go put these in water."
"9","Sheldon: Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music."
"9","Amy: Do you like it?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s kind of spooky."
"9","Amy: I can change it back."
"9","Sheldon: No, no, no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I’ll be fine."
"9","Amy: So, what’d you have in mind for tonight?"
"9","Sheldon: I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon."
"9","Amy: Um, that sounds nice, but I’m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift."
"9","Amy: You mean before you give it to me?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?"
"9","Amy: Of course."
"9","Sheldon: Why are we saying give it to you like that?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight."
"9","Sheldon: I see. Is that all right? I’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I’m gonna need verbal consent."
"9","Amy: Yes."
"9","Sheldon: You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet."
"9","Leonard: So, if you don’t like Star Wars, why are you here?"
"9","Wil: Oh, I’m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie’s bad, it’s gonna ruin their lives."
"9","Raj: Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me."
"9","Wil: See? That’s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn’t gonna change at all."
"9","Howard: He’s right."
"9","Leonard: Yeah. No matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again."
"9","Bernadette: Do you think Sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?"
"9","Penny: I don’t know. He said he’s ready."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin."
"9","Penny: Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself."
"9","Amy: Hi."
"9","Amy: So, um, should I get under the covers with you?"
"9","Sheldon: All right. Hello."
"9","Sheldon: Why are you shaking? Are you cold?"
"9","Amy: I’m just, um, really nervous."
"9","Sheldon: Why?"
"9","Amy: Well, I’ve been waiting for this for so long, I’ve just built it up in my head. I don’t know what to expect."
"9","Sheldon: Neither do I. But we can find out together."
"9","Leonard: I’m really nervous."
"9","Howard: I know. We’ve been waiting so long for this."
"9","Raj: And we’ve built it up in our heads so much."
"9","Wil: Guys, it’s just a movie."
"9","Leonard: That’s true."
"9","Raj: It is."
"9","Wil: Although, we all remember Jar Jar."
"9","Raj: Leonard, I, I’m scared again."
"9","Caption: A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away…."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would."
"9","Amy: Me, too."
"9","Sheldon: I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again."
"9","Amy: That works for me."
"9","Wil: I enjoyed that more than I thought I would."
"9","Raj: I don’t think I can walk right now."
"9","Arthur: Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?"
"9","Sheldon: Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don’t think I need any more advice."
"9","Arthur: I, I was just curious. How, how’d it go?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie."
"9","Arthur: But, uh, what, what about Amy?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn’t have the history with the franchise I do."
"9","Arthur: Okay. Good, good talk."
"9","Series 09 Episode 12 – The Sales Call Sublimation"
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon: I’m glad to see you made it safely. How’s your hotel?"
"9","Amy (on Skype): It’s not the best Best Western I’ve been to, but I’d say it’s the third best Best Western I’ve been to."
"9","(on Skype)"
"9","Sheldon: I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy."
"9","Amy: What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?"
"9","Sheldon: Mm, that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle."
"9","Amy: Okay, well, I should unpack."
"9","Sheldon: All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference."
"9","Amy: I will. I wish you were here."
"9","Sheldon: At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say."
"9","Amy: Okay, I’m glad you’re not here?"
"9","Sheldon: Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say."
"9","Amy: Good-bye, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means I’m available to be entertained, hmm. As today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?"
"9","Howard: Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands."
"9","Sheldon: That sounds awful. Raj?"
"9","Raj: Uh, I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me."
"9","Sheldon: That’s the one to beat. Leonard?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, if anything, I’m trying to get my Sheld-off."
"9","Sheldon: Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations."
"9","Raj: Well, I should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen."
"9","Sheldon: Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Penny: Hey."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Raj: Hello."
"9","Howard: Hi."
"9","Leonard: How was your day?"
"9","Penny: Oh, not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr. Gallo."
"9","Sheldon: A doctor? Well, I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes."
"9","Penny: I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to get in for months."
"9","Leonard: Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?"
"9","Penny: Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know."
"9","Howard: What kind of doctor is she?"
"9","Penny: Um, a psychiatrist. Why?"
"9","Howard: Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you’ll get to talk to her."
"9","Penny: Yeah, they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep."
"9","Raj: Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?"
"9","Penny: That’s interesting."
"9","Leonard: I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?"
"9","Raj: Low self-esteem."
"9","Howard: Social anxiety."
"9","Sheldon: Sexual insecurity."
"9","Leonard: None of that is true."
"9","Penny: Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on."
"9","Leonard: That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?"
"9","Penny: I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug."
"9","Leonard: What if I get caught?"
"9","Howard: Fear of failure."
"9","Raj: Lack of confidence."
"9","Sheldon: Kind of a wuss."
"9","Leonard: Fine, I’ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you."
"9","Penny: Thank you."
"9","Raj: Pushover."
"9","Howard: Spineless."
"9","Sheldon: Still hasn’t bought milk even though I told him two days ago."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"9","Howard: That was incredible."
"9","Bernadette: It was. I just wish Stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet."
"9","Howard: I know. It’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons."
"9","Stuart (knocking): You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?"
"9","(knocking): Y"
"9","Howard: What is it, Stuart?"
"9","Stuart: Can I come in?"
"9","Howard: Hang on. Should I send him away?"
"9","Bernadette: No, it’s okay."
"9","Stuart: Thanks, Bernie."
"9","Howard: What’s up?"
"9","Stuart: Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I’d make it easy on you guys and find my own place."
"9","Howard: Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight."
"9","Bernadette: So, when are you thinking of moving?"
"9","Stuart: Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?"
"9","Stuart: Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it."
"9","Bernadette: : You’re very welcome."
"9","Stuart: Hmm."
"9","Howard: What?"
"9","Stuart: Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you’re awake."
"9","Scene: The telescope room."
"9","Sheldon: What are you doing?"
"9","Raj: Uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced."
"9","Sheldon: Hmm. What are you doing now?"
"9","Raj: Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I see. How about now?"
"9","Raj: Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle."
"9","Raj: Fine, you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies."
"9","Sheldon: Yep, I’m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella."
"9","Raj: Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours."
"9","Sheldon: Found one."
"9","Raj: No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there."
"9","Sheldon: But, look, an optical transient."
"9","Raj: Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?"
"9","Sheldon: It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?"
"9","Raj: No."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light."
"9","Scene: Dr Gallo’s office."
"9","Leonard: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice."
"9","Dr Gallo: Ah, it’s my pleasure. I’m curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, she’s my mother. You know her?"
"9","Dr Gallo: No, not personally, but I have read all of her books."
"9","Leonard: Well, then you know her better than I do."
"9","Dr Gallo: Well, I’m not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all."
"9","Leonard: Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?"
"9","Dr Gallo: Well, I didn’t want to say it."
"9","Leonard: No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky."
"9","Dr Gallo: Sounds like you’re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her."
"9","Leonard: Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now."
"9","Dr Gallo: Mm. Good for you."
"9","Leonard: Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?"
"9","Dr Gallo: That’s heartbreaking."
"9","Leonard: Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Howard: You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want."
"9","Bernadette: Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is."
"9","Stuart: Boy, who would’ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I’d still be here two years later?"
"9","Howard: No one."
"9","Bernadette: Nobody thought that."
"9","Stuart: Well, that’s it."
"9","Bernadette: I guess so."
"9","Stuart: This is weird."
"9","Howard: Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya."
"9","Bernadette: Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is."
"9","Stuart: It’s okay. I know he loves me."
"9","Bernadette: Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in."
"9","Stuart: I will. And I really can’t thank you guys enough."
"9","Bernadette: Our pleasure."
"9","Stuart: Bye."
"9","Bernadette: Goodbye."
"9","Howard: He’s gone. Let’s start in the garage."
"9","Raj: Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found."
"9","Sheldon: Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation."
"9","Raj: It could be a trans-Neptunian object."
"9","Sheldon: Maybe it’s a new planet."
"9","Raj: Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet."
"9","Sheldon: Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I’ll be happy."
"9","Raj: Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…"
"9","Sheldon: Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist."
"9","Raj: A medium-sized asteroid."
"9","Sheldon: That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space."
"9","Raj: I kind of like chicken fingers."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor."
"9","Raj: Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery."
"9","Sheldon: I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it."
"9","Raj: You dream different than me."
"9","Sheldon: It is kind of cute."
"9","Raj: Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it."
"9","Sheldon: We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours."
"9","Leonard: Hi."
"9","Penny: Hey, how’d it go?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…"
"9","Penny: Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?"
"9","Leonard: Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct."
"9","Penny: You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder."
"9","Leonard: All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you."
"9","Penny: Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever."
"9","Leonard: So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?"
"9","Penny: I guess."
"9","Leonard: Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time."
"9","Scene: Stuarts former bedroom in Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Bernadette: Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?"
"9","Howard: No kidding. Oh, okay, I’m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?"
"9","Bernadette: Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?"
"9","Howard: Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave."
"9","Bernadette: Why can’t it be a woman cave?"
"9","Howard: As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want."
"9","Bernadette: I’m being serious."
"9","Howard: Well, what do you think we should do?"
"9","Bernadette: I don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair."
"9","Howard: Oh. He was so excited."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age."
"9","Howard: I’ll give it to him next time I see him."
"9","Bernadette: Have you heard from him since he left?"
"9","Howard: No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in."
"9","Bernadette: Hmm. Maybe he’s busy."
"9","Howard: Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?"
"9","Bernadette: No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?"
"9","Howard: Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries."
"9","Bernadette: And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple."
"9","Howard: That was pretty cute."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!"
"9","Raj: So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names."
"9","Sheldon: That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper."
"9","Raj: How is that both our names?"
"9","Sheldon: Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper."
"9","Raj: Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?"
"9","Sheldon: Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together."
"9","Leonard: Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself."
"9","Sheldon: Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now."
"9","Leonard: Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter."
"9","Raj: I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you."
"9","Sheldon: Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it."
"9","Raj: Wait, what happened to us?"
"9","Sheldon: Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid."
"9","Leonard: Well, what are you thinking of naming it?"
"9","Sheldon: I haven’t settled on anything yet."
"9","Raj: We haven’t settled on anything yet."
"9","Sheldon: All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there."
"9","Leonard: You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care."
"9","Raj: That is a great idea."
"9","Sheldon: It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever."
"9","Raj: So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?"
"9","Sheldon: I like it. Yeah, we’ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily."
"9","Raj: That’s just Amy."
"9","Sheldon: Exactly. See how well we work together?"
"9","Scene Dr Gallo’s office."
"9","Penny: And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying."
"9","Dr Gallo: Got it."
"9","Penny: Uh, do you have any questions?"
"9","Dr Gallo: Just one."
"9","Penny: Mm-hmm?"
"9","Dr Gallo: When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?"
"9","Penny: I just meant a question about the drug."
"9","Dr Gallo: Yeah, I know what you meant. Let’s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard."
"9","Penny: I don’t wanna."
"9","Dr Gallo: Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he’s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?"
"9","Penny: You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point."
"9","Amy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?"
"9","Sheldon: Good news. You’re an asteroid."
"9","Amy: Uh, please tell me what to say next."
"9","Sheldon: Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you."
"9","Amy: Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh."
"9","Amy: All of them?"
"9","Sheldon: Even the girls."
"9","Amy: Okay, I think I know what to say now."
"9","Penny: How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?"
"9","Dr Gallo: I went to college in the ’70s. It was a hairier time. I’m gonna say yes."
"9","Penny: You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable."
"9","Dr Gallo: Hmm."
"9","Penny: And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon."
"9","Dr Gallo: Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn’t sure if he was real."
"9","Penny: Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper."
"9","Dr Gallo: Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate."
"9","Penny: I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping."
"9","Dr Gallo: Oh, I’m glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety."
"9","Penny: Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage."
"9","Amy (on Skype): I miss you."
"9","Sheldon: I miss you as well."
"9","Howard: I can’t believe I miss Stuart."
"9","Penny: I guess I just miss when life was simpler."
"9","Scene: A street. Leonard is skipping ropes with some young girls."
"9","Girls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!"
"9","Leonard: Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers."
"9","Girls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!"

"9","Penny: Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?"
"9","Bernadette: Maybe he uses Kryptonite."
"9","Emily: Well, Batman’s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do."
"9","Penny: No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man."
"9","Leonard: What is happening?"
"9","Howard: I don’t know."
"9","Raj: But it’s beautiful."
"9","Penny: And now Ben Affleck is Batman?"
"9","Emily: Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love."
"9","Penny: Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night."
"9","Bernadette: We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet."
"9","Penny: Oh, I love me some Leo."
"9","Leonard: And it’s gone."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better."
"9","Leonard: Good for you."
"9","Sheldon: My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall."
"9","Howard: Glad to hear it."
"9","Sheldon: I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow."
"9","Raj: Yay."
"9","Sheldon: Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again."
"9","Penny: You really don’t know why?"
"9","Sheldon: No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof."
"9","Leonard: Let me refresh your memory."
"9","Flashback"
"9","Sheldon: Penny, rub Vicks on my chest."
"9","Penny: Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me."
"9","Bernadette: I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make."
"9","Sheldon: I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke."
"9","Howard: Hey, she came all the way here…"
"9","Bernadette: You’re gonna want to take these with food."
"9","Raj: Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you."
"9","Sheldon: She’s a dermatologist."
"9","Emily: I went to medical school."

"9","Leonard: All right, here you go."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, I’m dying."
"9","Leonard: You’re not dying. It’s just the flu."
"9","Sheldon: I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me."
"9","Back to the present."

"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom."
"9","Amy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon."
"9","(on Skype)"
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Amy: Are you feeling any better?"
"9","Sheldon: Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason."
"9","Amy: Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong."
"9","Sheldon: You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?"
"9","Amy: Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky."
"9","Sheldon: I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended."
"9","Sheldon: You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?"
"9","Amy: No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting."
"9","Sheldon: You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television."
"9","Amy: Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I’m gonna go take pictures. Bye."
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Raj: Hey, Stuart."
"9","Stuart: Hey. Where’s Sheldon? Still sick?"
"9","Leonard: No, he’s fine. We just needed a little break."
"9","Stuart: Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door."
"9","Howard: He was being a jerk to everyone. Don’t take it personally."
"9","Stuart: Oh, I’m on so many antidepressants, I couldn’t if I wanted to."
"9","Raj: I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon."
"9","Leonard: I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles."
"9","Howard: You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship."
"9","Raj: Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, I’m in."
"9","Howard: We should all take a trip or something."
"9","Leonard: Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go."
"9","Howard: Bernie would love that."
"9","Raj: Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there."
"9","Leonard: That sounds really fun."
"9","Raj: Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus."
"9","Leonard: No."
"9","Howard: No."
"9","Leonard: So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas."
"9","Penny: Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?"
"9","Leonard: Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay."
"9","Penny: Well, I’m in. When are we going?"
"9","Leonard: This weekend."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, where are we going?"
"9","Leonard: Well, Vegas, but…"
"9","Sheldon: Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you."
"9","Leonard: That’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited."
"9","Sheldon: Well, now, well, that’s hurtful."
"9","Penny: Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there."
"9","Sheldon: I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit."
"9","Leonard: Not this time."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz."
"9","Leonard: He’s coming, too."
"9","Sheldon: Well, then Raj and I will…"

"9","Sheldon: Very well. Stuart."

"9","Amy: I said what’s new, but sure."
"9","Sheldon: Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?"
"9","Amy: Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?"
"9","Sheldon: You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship."
"9","Amy: Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them."
"9","Sheldon: I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio."
"9","Amy: Who else’s side could you have been on?"
"9","Sheldon: I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them."
"9","Sheldon: Fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip."
"9","Amy: Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It’s called empathy. It’s something you could work on."
"9","Sheldon: I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him."
"9","Amy: Great. Now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person."
"9","Sheldon: Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat."
"9","Amy: Glad I could help."
"9","Sheldon: Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to."
"9","Amy: I feel so, so bad."
"9","Sheldon: Hey, we’re both great at this."
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it."
"9","Leonard: Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen, you spoil it in advance."
"9","Sheldon: Hey, if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry."
"9","Leonard: Thank you. I appreciate that."
"9","Sheldon: I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip."
"9","Leonard: Appreciate that, too."
"9","Sheldon: Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?"
"9","Leonard: You’re still not coming."
"9","Sheldon: What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong."
"9","Leonard: Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come."
"9","Sheldon: Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?"
"9","Leonard: Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come."
"9","Sheldon: Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour."
"9","Leonard: Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour."
"9","Sheldon: My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?"
"9","Scene: Howard and Berndette’s house."
"9","Sheldon: Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry."
"9","Howard: Wow. I’m impressed."
"9","Sheldon: No, no, no, wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute."
"9","Howard: Apology accepted."
"9","Bernadette: Forgiven, forgiven."
"9","Sheldon: All right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts."
"9","Howard: Sheldon Cooper apologized to me"
"9","Bernadette: And he made it all better."
"9","Scene: The apartment bathroom."
"9","Sheldon: All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior."
"9","Penny: Can this wait?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make."
"9","Penny: Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out."
"9","Sheldon: Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?"
"9","Penny: Leonard."
"9","Sheldon: You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry."
"9","Stuart: Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that."
"9","Sheldon: And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas."
"9","Stuart: What trip to Las Vegas?"
"9","Sheldon: The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus."
"9","Stuart: Of course, I wasn’t invited."
"9","Sheldon: That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?"
"9","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"9","Sheldon: Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology."
"9","Raj: Of course I do."
"9","Sheldon: And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that."
"9","Emily: Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…"
"9","Raj: Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology."
"9","Emily: Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again."
"9","Raj: Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it."
"9","Emily: Why are you defending him?"
"9","Sheldon: I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium."
"9","Emily: Well, I don’t accept your apology."
"9","Raj: What are you doing?"
"9","Emily: It’s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time."
"9","Raj: Fine, how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you’d stop."
"9","Emily: Oh, you want me to stop? No problem."
"9","Raj: No, come on, please don’t leave."
"9","Sheldon: Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…"
"9","Emily: Don’t worry, you’re good."
"9","Sheldon: I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more."
"9","Penny: So, was the fight really bad?"
"9","Sheldon: No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking."
"9","Leonard: You think they’ll still go on the trip?"
"9","Sheldon: All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…"
"9","Leonard: They’re not going on the trip."
"9","Penny: No."
"9","Raj: What is wrong with you?"
"9","Sheldon: Look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club."
"9","Raj: You went to Emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying."
"9","Sheldon: That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again."
"9","All: No."
"9","Penny: Is she okay?"
"9","Raj: Yeah, I calmed her down, but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going."
"9","Howard: Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option."
"9","Sheldon: Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves."
"9","Raj: That’s very mature of you."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth."
"9","Penny: And there’s your next T-shirt."
"9","Scene: The party bus."
"9","Howard: Ooh, check out the stripper pole."
"9","Bernadette: You know what that means."
"9","Leonard: That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?"
"9","Raj: You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah."
"9","Bernadette: This is so cool."
"9","Penny: Here’s some champagne."
"9","Leonard: Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…"
"9","Sheldon: Aha."
"9","Leonard: What are you doing?"
"9","Sheldon: My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet."
"9","Penny: You couldn’t give us just one weekend?"
"9","Stuart: I told him this was a bad idea."
"9","Leonard: What do we do, kick them off?"
"9","Penny: If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked."
"9","Sheldon: Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily."
"9","Raj: Oh, God."
"9","Sheldon: Emily, as I’m sure you know, I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali."
"9","Raj: You know, Sheldon…"
"9","Emily: Shh, let him finish."
"9","Sheldon: So, for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future, I’m sorry."
"9","Emily: Thank you."
"9","Sheldon: Good. Then I’ll be leaving now."
"9","Emily: Oh, it’s okay, Sheldon. Come with us."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, that’s very kind of you. But I’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. Let’s go, Stuart."
"9","Stuart: But I want to stay."
"9","Sheldon: Stuart, now."
"9","Emily: You know, I know he’s a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him."
"9","Penny: And now you see the problem."
"9","Leonard: Come on, you pain in the ass."
"9","Sheldon: That’s me. Bye, Stuart."
"9","Stuart: Wait. I’m a pain in the ass, too."
"9","Scene: Later on the party bus."
"9","Sheldon: Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?"
"9","Emily: At the moment? No, not really."
"9","Penny: Shake it, baby."
"9","Bernadette: Ooh, work that thing."
"9","Series 09 Episode 14 – The Meemaw Materialisation"
"9","Scene: The foyer."
"9","Sheldon: Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that’s the FBI."
"9","Leonard: If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb."
"9","Penny: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this."
"9","Penny: What is that?"
"9","Sheldon: Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder."
"9","Penny: Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person."
"9","Leonard: That someone has a name."
"9","Sheldon: Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth."
"9","Leonard: Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears."
"9","Penny: I park fine."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!"
"9","Leonard: Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The airport arrivals area."
"9","Sheldon: That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her."
"9","Leonard: Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?"
"9","Sheldon: And that’s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is."
"9","Leonard: Oh, that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle."
"9","Leonard: Same as when we lost you at the zoo."
"9","Sheldon: Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart."
"9","Leonard: Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider."
"9","Meemaw: Moon Pie."
"9","Sheldon: Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you."
"9","Meemaw: I’m so happy to see you, too."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw."
"9","Leonard: Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw."
"9","Meemaw: Thank you."
"9","Sheldon: No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four."
"9","Meemaw: Is that nice to say to your friend?"
"9","Sheldon: It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard."
"9","Leonard: Can you please live with us forever?"
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Howard: That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?"
"9","Raj: I’m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?"
"9","Howard: I’m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar."
"9","Raj: She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife."
"9","Girl: Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?"
"9","Raj: Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it."
"9","Girl: Which is probably why that movie sucks."
"9","Howard: Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned."
"9","Raj: I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?"
"9","Girl: I just think it gets more credit than it deserves."
"9","Howard: Oh, that’s what I said an hour ago."
"9","Girl: Wow. You’ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?"
"9","Howard: You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur."
"9","Raj: It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon: Are you comfortable?"
"9","Meemaw: Very. It’s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs."
"9","Sheldon: You were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw."
"9","Amy: Hi. Nice to meet you."
"9","Meemaw: Nice to meet you, too."
"9","Amy: How was your trip?"
"9","Meemaw: Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch."
"9","Amy: That’s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon’s spot. You know, I don’t even get to sit there."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her."
"9","Amy: Can I have a tissue?"
"9","Meemaw: Of course."
"9","Sheldon: Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man."
"9","Meemaw: He’s been saying that since he was little. I still don’t know what it means."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready."
"9","Meemaw: Oh, now don’t you go looking through my suitcase for presents."
"9","Sheldon: If I did, would I find any?"
"9","Meemaw: Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers."
"9","Sheldon: That’s a risk I’m willing to take."
"9","Amy: Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…"
"9","Meemaw: Okay, now let’s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up."
"9","Amy: S, s, si, size me up?"
"9","Meemaw: Sheldon’s mother may be okay with you, but I’m not so easy."
"9","Amy: Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me."
"9","Meemaw: Oh, you better hope so."
"9","Sheldon: A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw."
"9","Meemaw: Oh, you’re welcome, Moon Pie."
"9","Sheldon: Amy, why don’t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this."
"9","Raj: Oh, I see you’re reading Saga."
"9","Girl: Yeah, I hear it’s pretty good."
"9","Raj: It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover."
"9","Girl: I’ll take your word for it."
"9","Howard: You should. He’s really looked."
"9","Raj: I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard."
"9","Howard: Hi."
"9","Girl: Claire."
"9","Raj: Well, I’ve never seen you here before, Claire."
"9","Claire: It’s my first time. I’m looking for inspiration for this movie I’m writing."
"9","Howard: You’re a screenwriter?"
"9","Claire: Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car."
"9","Raj: Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist."
"9","Claire: You’re really a scientist?"
"9","Raj: Well, astrophysicist."
"9","Claire: That’s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It’s animated sci-fi for kids."
"9","Raj: Sure. I love animated movies."
"9","Howard: He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it."
"9","Raj: Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life."
"9","Claire: Here’s my number. Give me a call, we’ll get together."
"9","Raj: Yeah, great."
"9","Claire: See ya."
"9","Raj: Yeah, bye."
"9","Howard: What are you doing? You have a girlfriend."
"9","Raj: So?"
"9","Howard: So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?"
"9","Raj: I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful."
"9","Howard: Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?"
"9","Raj: I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend."
"9","Penny: Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?"
"9","Meemaw: Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey."
"9","Sheldon: Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass."
"9","Meemaw: Thank you, Moon Pie."
"9","Amy: I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?"
"9","Meemaw: ‘Cause he’s so nummy-nummy."
"9","Leonard and Penny: She could just eat him up."
"9","Sheldon: And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her."
"9","Meemaw: It’s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don’t."
"9","Amy: Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar."
"9","Sheldon: How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask."
"9","Amy: Well, now I know."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah."
"9","Meemaw: So, Penny, I understand you have a new job."
"9","Penny: Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep."
"9","Meemaw: Oh. It’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career."
"9","Amy: I have a relationship and a full-time career, too."
"9","Meemaw: That doesn’t bode well."
"9","Amy: Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work."
"9","Meemaw: Well, Leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard’s work is more of a hobby."
"9","Leonard: That’s my best friend."
"9","Amy: Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do."
"9","Meemaw: I appreciate your honesty, dear."
"9","Amy: Thank you."
"9","Meemaw: And here’s some more honesty. I don’t like you very much."
"9","Amy: Well, maybe I don’t like you either."
"9","Sheldon: Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s."
"9","Amy: I think I should leave."
"9","Sheldon: But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time."
"9","Amy: The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this."
"9","Meemaw: Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring."
"9","Amy: What ring?"
"9","Leonard: Maybe we should give them some privacy."
"9","Penny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you."
"9","Amy: You have an engagement ring?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes."
"9","Amy: Penny, did you know about this?"
"9","Penny: All right, let’s go."
"9","Amy: When did you get an engagement ring?"
"9","Sheldon: My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up."
"9","Meemaw: Well, thank goodness for that."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t think I could do that."
"9","Meemaw: Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger."
"9","Sheldon: I’m gonna opt out of that one, too."
"9","Amy: Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs."
"9","Sheldon: All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?"
"9","Meemaw: You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now."
"9","Amy: Don’t speak to him like he’s a child."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"9","Bernadette: Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her."
"9","Raj: Just to help her with her screenplay."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad."
"9","Howard: You weren’t there. He was really flirting."
"9","Raj: Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes."
"9","Bernadette: I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal."
"9","Howard: Really? So it’s okay if I fl…"
"9","Bernadette: Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?"
"9","Raj: Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?"
"9","Howard: No. Never."
"9","Bernadette: Absolutely."
"9","Howard: What?"
"9","Bernadette: Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this."
"9","Howard: Fine. I had reservations about you, too."
"9","Bernadette: No, you didn’t."
"9","Howard: No, I didn’t."
"9","Bernadette: Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out."
"9","Howard: Me, too. And I think you’re even more beautiful than this rose."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Penny: Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding."
"9","Leonard: Did it?"
"9","Penny: Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
"9","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"9","Penny: Come in."
"9","Leonard: Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?"
"9","Sheldon: No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately."
"9","Penny: Uh-oh."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?"
"9","Raj: All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship."
"9","Howard: Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily."
"9","Bernadette: Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers."
"9","Howard: And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke."
"9","Raj: I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got."
"9","Bernadette: You’re right. It could totally happen."
"9","Claire (voice): Hello?"
"9","(voice)"
"9","Raj: Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store."
"9","Claire: Hey, what’s up? Figure out what time you’re free?"
"9","Raj: Actually, that’s why I’m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend."
"9","Claire: Okay. Good for you."
"9","Raj: Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out."
"9","Claire: I didn’t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay."
"9","Raj: Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?"
"9","Claire: Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend."
"9","Raj: Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe."
"9","Claire: Sure, we had a vibe."
"9","Raj: I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?"
"9","Bernadette: You still have a girlfriend."
"9","Raj: Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay."
"9","Claire: Hang on. We’re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything."
"9","Raj: Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding."
"9","Claire: Look, it’s just coffee. I’ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no."
"9","Raj: Okay. That hurts a little, but okay."
"9","Claire: Great. I’ll text you."
"9","Raj: Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy."
"9","Bernadette: Are you gonna tell Emily?"
"9","Raj: Yeah, of course. We have no secrets."
"9","Howard: When are you gonna tell Emily?"
"9","Raj: He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him."
"9","Amy: Look, I know you think I’m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I’m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with."
"9","Meemaw: I know more than you think I do."
"9","Amy: Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?"
"9","Meemaw: Young lady, if you think I don’t know what it’s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you’re wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband."
"9","Amy: Really?"
"9","Meemaw: There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen."
"9","Amy: Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?"
"9","Meemaw: Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don’t want to see that happen again."
"9","Penny: Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you."
"9","Sheldon: No, I wouldn’t."
"9","Leonard: Just get in here."
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Penny: Go ahead."
"9","Sheldon: Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you."
"9","Amy: Oh, Sheldon, thank you."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."
"9","Meemaw: I did."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress."
"9","Leonard: He never disappoints, does he?"
"9","Amy: I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?"
"9","Sheldon: Well…"
"9","Penny: Say yes."
"9","Meemaw: Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won’t stand in your way."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you."
"9","Amy: So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?"
"9","Meemaw: I suppose."
"9","Sheldon: I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets."
"9","Raj: Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work."
"9","Claire: This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn’t too scary for children."
"9","Fantasy seqeunce."
"9","Raj: And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met."
"9","Claire: Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?"
"9","Raj: I will."

"9","Leonard: Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no."
"9","Howard: Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean."
"9","Sheldon: Not a clue. Raj?"
"9","Raj: Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily."
"9","Leonard: You don’t sound very excited about it."
"9","Raj: Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other."
"9","Howard: Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?"
"9","Raj: You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?"
"9","Howard: You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah, just get it over with."
"9","Raj: Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?"
"9","Howard: No."
"9","Leonard: Not really."
"9","Sheldon: You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Penny: So, you really gonna break up with her?"
"9","Raj: Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?"
"9","Penny: Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?"
"9","Leonard: I stopped counting at four."
"9","Penny: All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears."
"9","Raj: Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out."
"9","Leonard: She meant Emily."
"9","Penny: No, I, I really didn’t."
"9","Scene: Emily’s apartment."
"9","Emily: You’re seriously breaking up with me?"
"9","Raj: Yeah."
"9","Emily: And you thought right before Valentine’s Day was a good time to do it?"
"9","Raj: You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days."
"9","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"9","Raj (on phone): Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?"
"9","(on phone)"
"9","Claire: Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend."
"9","Raj: But I just broke up with my girlfriend."
"9","Claire: Right before Valentine’s Day? What an ass."
"9","Raj: Please take me back. Our love was meant to be."
"9","Raj: I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day."
"9","Leonard: Well, you were right, tears."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Amy: Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes."
"9","Sheldon: I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day."
"9","Amy: People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight."
"9","Amy: What do you mean?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title."
"9","Amy: Oh. That is so sweet."
"9","Sheldon: So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags."

"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Howard: I’m gonna check the temp on the tub."
"9","Bernadette: Don’t make it too hot."
"9","Howard: Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in."
"9","Bernadette: Look at that, you shaved it all."
"9","Howard: You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?"
"9","Bernadette: Ew, really? Get it out."
"9","Howard: How?"
"9","Bernadette: Uh, wish we had a skimmer."
"9","Howard: Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen."
"9","Bernadette: I don’t know how to turn off the jets."
"9","Howard: Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer."
"9","Scene: A restaurant."
"9","Leonard: Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour."
"9","Penny: An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation."
"9","Leonard: I know."
"9","Penny: So what did you say?"
"9","Leonard: Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass."
"9","Penny: All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?"
"9","Leonard: Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?"
"9","Penny: Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?"
"9","Leonard: A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper."
"9","Penny: Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?"
"9","Leonard: I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?"
"9","Maitre d’: I’m afraid so."
"9","Leonard: Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?"
"9","Maitre d’: Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?"
"9","Man: I did."
"9","Leonard: Oh, I took care of it."
"9","Amy: Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live."
"9","Sheldon: Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…"
"9","Amy: And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…"
"9","Together: Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun With Flags."
"9","Amy: Consider tonight’s episode a Valentine’s Day gift for you, our viewers."
"9","Sheldon: It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else."
"9","Amy: Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions."
"9","Sheldon: Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend."
"9","Amy: No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?"
"9","Raj (voice): What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?"
"9","(voice)"
"9","Amy: Rajesh?"
"9","Raj: Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?"
"9","Amy: I, I think it starts with good communication."
"9","Sheldon: You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller."
"9","Howard: I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much."
"9","Bernadette: I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive."
"9","Howard: Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?"
"9","Bernadette: No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it."
"9","Howard: Well, how do we do that?"
"9","Bernadette: Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel."
"9","Howard: Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check."
"9","Bernadette: Anything else?"
"9","Howard: To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah."
"9","Scene: The restaurant."
"9","Penny: This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’."
"9","Leonard: What are you gonna say?"
"9","Penny: I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him."
"9","Leonard: I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that."
"9","Penny: I’m still sleeping with you tonight."
"9","Leonard: See if you can get a table by the window."
"9","Penny: Hi there. What’s your name?"
"9","Maitre d’: Glen."
"9","Penny: Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?"
"9","Maitre d’: Well, you know, Valentine’s Day."
"9","Penny: Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…"
"9","Maitre d’: With all due respect, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do."
"9","Penny: You don’t have to call me ma’am."
"9","Maitre d’: Okay."
"9","Penny: I mean, we’re basically the same age."
"9","Penny: How old are you?"
"9","Maitre d’: I’m 21. How old are you?"
"9","Penny: Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here."
"9","Leonard: What? Why?"
"9","Penny: Because I’m young. Let’s go."
"9","Amy: Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone."
"9","Raj (voice): You really think so?"
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you."
"9","Amy: Your friend is hurting."
"9","Raj: No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much."
"9","Sheldon: I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba."
"9","Amy: Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags."
"9","Barry (voice): Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too."
"9","Raj: Kripke? Is that you?"
"9","Barry: Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties."
"9","Sheldon: Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related."
"9","Barry: Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?"
"9","Sheldon: I don’t see why not."
"9","Bernadette: He’s eating. That’s a good sign."
"9","Howard: You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again."
"9","Bernadette: He’s pretty cute."
"9","Howard: He is. Should we name him?"
"9","Bernadette: It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?"
"9","Howard: Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me."
"9","Bernadette: Are you okay?"
"9","Howard: No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?"
"9","Howard: Poor judgement, obviously."
"9","Bernadette: He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine."
"9","Howard: How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal."
"9","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"9","Leonard: It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?"
"9","Penny: It is freaking amazing."
"9","Leonard: Well, glad you’re feeling better."
"9","Penny: I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before."
"9","Leonard: Is that a big deal?"
"9","Penny: Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?"
"9","Leonard: Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…"
"9","Penny: Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?"
"9","Leonard: Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot."
"9","Penny: Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over."
"9","Leonard: No, they’re not."
"9","Penny: You’re closer to 40 than you are 30."
"9","Leonard: Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight."
"9","Penny: Won’t make us any younger."
"9","Leonard: Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had."
"9","Penny: Okay, like what?"
"9","Leonard: I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking."
"9","Amy: Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship."
"9","Sheldon: Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree."
"9","Raj: But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?"
"9","Amy: Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away."
"9","Sheldon: And actually, it was three different men."
"9","Barry: Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?"
"9","Amy: Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke."
"9","Barry: No, actuawwy, I’m stiw here."
"9","Amy: Now?"
"9","Barry: Yup."
"9","Amy: Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke."
"9","Raj: Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again."
"9","Sheldon: Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems."
"9","Amy: I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…"
"9","Raj: Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents."
"9","Amy: …spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags."
"9","Barry: Hey, I think I got cut off."
"9","Amy: Hello, Kripke."
"9","Barry: I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?"
"9","Leonard: Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing."
"9","Leonard: Are you actually gonna dance?"
"9","Leonard: Of course."
"9","Penny: Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?"
"9","Leonard: No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business."
"9","Penny: Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff."
"9","Leonard: That sounds fun. When’s it start?"
"9","Penny: Midnight."
"9","Leonard: Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it."
"9","Penny: Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out."
"9","Leonard: Oh, thank God."
"9","Penny: Yes."
"9","Howard: It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, terrific."
"9","Howard: It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me."
"9","Bernadette: If you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested."
"9","Howard: Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, cut off his head? That’s where his little nose is."
"9","Howard: He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe."
"9","Bernadette: Howie, this is just your hypochondria."
"9","Howard: No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria."
"9","Bernadette: We’ll find another time to tell him I’m pregnant."
"9","Raj (voice): I mean, this is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much."
"9","Amy: It really can."
"9","Sheldon: All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with."
"9","Raj: I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now."
"9","Amy: No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you’re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard."
"9","Sheldon: Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us."
"9","Barry: Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius."
"9","Amy: I’m just gonna push all the buttons."
"9","Sheldon: Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it."
"9","Amy: Really?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever."
"9","Amy: So do I."
"9","Sheldon: When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…"
"9","Leonard and Penny: Happy Valentine’s Day!"
"9","Leonard: We are young and fun."
"9","Sheldon: I stand corrected. Fun."
"9","Sheldon: Congratulations on a successful live show."
"9","Amy: And a lovely Valentine’s Day."
"9","Penny: Cleaning up is not young and fun."
"9","Leonard: It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this."
"9","Sheldon: Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?"
"9","Amy: Interesting, and when would you use the singular?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go."
"9","Series 09 Episode 16 – The Positive Negative Reaction"
"9","Following a “previously on” sequence."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"9","Howard: Morning."
"9","Bernadette: Morning."
"9","Howard: We? What is this?"
"9","Bernadette: I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back."
"9","Howard: Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more."
"9","Bernadette: What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?"
"9","Howard: Are you serious?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah."
"9","Howard: Are you sure?"
"9","Bernadette: Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…"
"9","Howard: Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents? We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall."
"9","Bernadette: I know, it’s crazy."
"9","Howard: It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out."
"9","Howard: But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid."
"9","Bernadette: I don’t know, Howie."
"9","Howard: Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket."
"9","Bernadette: Calm down, it’s gonna be okay."
"9","Howard: How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Leonard: Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?"
"9","Raj: Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays."
"9","Sheldon: Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Raj: Hey, bud."
"9","Leonard: Ready to play when you are."
"9","Howard: Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something."
"9","Raj: If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you’re the first one."
"9","Leonard: What’s going on?"
"9","Howard: I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father."
"9","Leonard: What? Congratulations."
"9","Raj: That’s so amazing."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, no."
"9","Leonard: Why oh, no?"
"9","Sheldon: Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?"
"9","Leonard: Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?"
"9","Leonard: You’re the other baby."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"
"9","Leonard: Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?"
"9","Sheldon: I guess we’ll call this a draw."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s patio."
"9","Bernadette: So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…"
"9","Penny (reading text): Leonard says you’re pregnant."
"9","(reading text)"
"9","Amy: What?"
"9","Penny: Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?"
"9","Bernadette: I’m pregnant."
"9","Penny: Oh, my God, I can’t believe it."
"9","Amy: This is so exciting."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, it’s all real exciting."
"9","Penny: Are, are you not happy about this?"
"9","Bernadette: I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat."
"9","Penny: No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever."
"9","Bernadette: Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones."
"9","Penny: Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny."
"9","Amy: I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to."
"9","Penny: Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all."
"9","Bernadette: You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down."
"9","Howard: I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own vegetables."
"9","Leonard: Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting."
"9","Howard: And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?"
"9","Sheldon: Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much."
"9","Raj: Well, he could bring the baby here."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink."
"9","Howard: Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?"
"9","Raj: I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars."
"9","Howard: A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now."
"9","Raj: I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance."
"9","Howard: This isn’t a joke."
"9","Raj: I wasn’t joking."
"9","Leonard: It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out."
"9","Raj: Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it."
"9","Howard: You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now."
"9","Leonard: Hey, you know what we should do?"
"9","Sheldon: All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?"
"9","Leonard: Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea."
"9","Amy: Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this."
"9","Penny: Yeah, yeah, we should go out."
"9","Bernadette: Where?"
"9","Penny: Uh, I don’t know, a bar?"
"9","Bernadette: Can’t drink."
"9","Penny: We can, but all right."
"9","Amy: Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?"
"9","Bernadette: Doctor said I can’t have sushi."
"9","Penny: Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub."
"9","Bernadette: Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub."
"9","Amy: Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t laugh either?"
"9","Scene: A bar."
"9","Raj: I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…"
"9","Leonard: And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile."
"9","All: Cheers."
"9","Howard: Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants."
"9","Sheldon: And can keep a small portion of their heads dry."
"9","Howard: If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money."
"9","Leonard: There’s no reason you can’t."
"9","Howard: That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model."
"9","Leonard: That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it."
"9","Sheldon: Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice."
"9","Leonard: Uh, these are strong, you should slow down."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah."
"9","Scene: The same, later."
"9","Howard: Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas."
"9","Leonard: How is that a new invention?"
"9","Howard: I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them."
"9","Raj: It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad."
"9","Sheldon: This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?"
"9","Leonard: The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You."
"9","Sheldon: That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?"
"9","Raj: Uh, it’s in the corner."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?"
"9","Raj: I hope the bathroom is clearly marked."
"9","Leonard: Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway."
"9","Howard: Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people."
"9","Raj: They have that. It’s called Uber."
"9","Howard: Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah. Why?"
"9","Howard: Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?"
"9","Leonard: Wow. I’ve never thought about that."
"9","Howard: And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence."
"9","Raj: Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City."
"9","Leonard: You may have actually just come up with something."
"9","Howard: You think so?"
"9","Leonard: I really do."
"9","Sheldon: You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it."
"9","Amy: Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby."
"9","Penny: Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes."
"9","Bernadette: I kind of already do that for Howie."
"9","Penny: And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor."
"9","Amy: Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?"
"9","Bernadette: Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless."
"9","Penny: Oh, tell us."
"9","Amy: Yeah, tell us."
"9","Bernadette: No, I’m embarrassed."
"9","Penny: Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it."
"9","Amy: Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it."
"9","Bernadette: Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous."
"9","Amy: Oh, that sounds juicy."
"9","Bernadette: Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…"
"9","Penny: Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?"
"9","Bernadette: Kind of on Sheldon’s bed."
"9","Penny: No."
"9","Bernadette: I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here."
"9","Amy: How could you do that?"
"9","Bernadette: I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another."
"9","Amy: I do know what that’s like. I really do."
"9","Scene: The bar."
"9","Leonard: I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this."
"9","Howard: I’m not finding anything either."
"9","Raj: It’s a good sign."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, wait, I found something."
"9","Howard: Damn. What is it?"
"9","Sheldon: This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared."
"9","Leonard: Can you focus on what we’re talking about?"
"9","Sheldon: All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible."
"9","Raj: Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us."
"9","Sheldon: And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?"
"9","Leonard: I’d enjoy that."
"9","Sheldon: Nah, she’s a good kid."
"9","Howard: If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems."
"9","Raj: Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up."
"9","Leonard: I’m telling you, you got this."
"9","Howard: Maybe you’re right."
"9","Sheldon: Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be."
"9","Howard: Thank you, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s hot tub."
"9","Bernadette: You guys can go in if you want."
"9","Penny: No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in."
"9","Amy: Then why are we drinking?"
"9","Penny: Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right? (Checking text) Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them."
"9","(Checking text)"
"9","Bernadette: That sounds fun."
"9","Amy: Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me."
"9","Penny: What’s it say?"
"9","Amy: Would you like to sing karaoke with us."
"9","Bernadette: How is that a drunk text?"
"9","Amy: He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted."
"9","Raj (rapping): Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move."
"9","(rapping)"
"9","Leonard (singing): You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
"9","(singing)"
"9","Raj: Just bust a move,"
"9","Leonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
"9","Penny: Hey, guys. Congratulations."
"9","Howard: Thank you."
"9","Amy: Hi. How are you doing?"
"9","Sheldon: Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it."
"9","Howard: I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?"
"9","Bernadette: Sure."
"9","Penny: So, you gonna get up there later?"
"9","Sheldon: A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am."
"9","Howard: I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I’m done being scared."
"9","Bernadette: It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too."
"9","Howard: Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also really excited. I mean it."
"9","Bernadette: Me, too."
"9","Howard: I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger."
"9","Penny (singing): Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’."
"9","Amy (singing): We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?"
"9","Penny (singing): Say there’s another and look right in my eyes."
"9","Amy (singing): My first love broke my heart for the first time."
"9","Together: And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you’d always be mine."
"9","Howard (singing): Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’."
"9","Raj (singing): Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
"9","Leonard (singing): Ah, push it."
"9","Bernadette: I appreciate this, but you really…"
"9","Leonard (singing): Push it real good."
"9","Sheldon (singing): Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring."
"9","Howard: I’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. (Singing) Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me."
"9","(Singing)"
"9","Sheldon: You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?"
"9","Howard: Thank you, Pasadena. Good night."
"9","Penny: That was such a fun night."
"9","Leonard: Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic."
"9","Penny: Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box."
"9","Leonard: Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it."
"9","Penny: Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette."
"9","Leonard: Me, too. So, you ever think about it?"
"9","Penny: Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?"
"9","Leonard: I think we’d make amazing parents."
"9","Sheldon: Will you guys keep it down?"
"9","Penny: On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity."
"9","Series 09 Episode 17 – The Celebration Experimentation"
"9","Scene: The stairwell"
"9","Amy: So Sheldon, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk about but I know it’s kind of a touchy subject."
"9","Leonard: Way to narrow it down to everything."
"9","Sheldon: What is it?"
"9","Amy: Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have."
"9","Amy: Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?"
"9","Penny: W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?"
"9","Leonard: Well, where’s that information been this whole time?"
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Penny: Well, where is he?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon?"
"9","Leonard: I’ll check his room."
"9","Sheldon: Surprise."
"9","Penny: Oh, my God."
"9","Sheldon: Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you."
"9","Amy: I’m sorry I brought it up."
"9","Penny: Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?"
"9","Sheldon: Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink."
"9","Amy: But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you."
"9","Leonard: One day. Right."
"9","Amy: Can you please just tell me why?"
"9","Sheldon: Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me."
"9","Amy: I’m sorry."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends."
"9","Penny: Oh, poor thing."
"9","Sheldon: When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window."
"9","Amy: You realize none of those things would happen now?"
"9","Sheldon: I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?"
"9","Amy: Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour."
"9","Penny: You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come."
"9","Leonard: And we live here, so we have no choice."
"9","Penny: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time."
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Howard: You have any idea what you’re getting Sheldon for his birthday?"
"9","Raj: He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil."
"9","Leonard: Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party."
"9","Howard: That’s funny. Let’s do that."
"9","Leonard: Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up."
"9","Raj: You mean, some guy in a lame suit?"
"9","Leonard: Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?"
"9","Stuart: Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he’d get paid. And I wouldn’t tell him."
"9","Leonard: Can I get his contact info?"
"9","Stuart: Sure, uh, but just so you know, he’s kind of a diva."
"9","Leonard: He is?"
"9","Stuart: Oh, yeah. Won’t take the bus. He won’t pack his own lunch. Won’t let you spend the night on his couch."
"9","Amy: Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?"
"9","Sheldon: Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car."
"9","Penny: All right, what about music?"
"9","Sheldon: I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing."
"9","Penny: No music it is."
"9","Bernadette: What kind of cake do you like?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me."
"9","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"9","Raj: Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."
"9","Raj: You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie."
"9","Howard: Don’t say that to him."
"9","Raj: What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something. Like, I love me some Clooney."
"9","Leonard: Don’t say that to anyone."
"9","Penny: Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart."
"9","Stuart: Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don’t always feel like I’m part of the group."
"9","Penny: Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?"
"9","Barry: Hewwo, I hope I’m not too earwy."
"9","Bernadette: No, no, no. Come on in."
"9","Barry: And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?"
"9","Bernadette: Doing great."
"9","Stuart: You, you’re pregnant?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah."
"9","Stuart: Sounds like something a member of the group might know."
"9","Penny: Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later."
"9","Leonard: Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?"
"9","Adam West: Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale’s overrated."
"9","Raj: Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role."
"9","Adam: Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney."
"9","Howard: Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman."
"9","Adam: I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar’s bungalow."
"9","Leonard: I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale."
"9","Adam: There’s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West."
"9","Howard: Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?"
"9","Leonard: Sure."
"9","Raj: Yeah, of course."
"9","Adam: What’s an Affleck?"
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Sheldon: Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?"
"9","Amy: Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated."
"9","Sheldon: But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?"
"9","Amy: Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Thank you."
"9","Amy: Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit."
"9","Sheldon: But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party."
"9","Leonard: So, Mother, I’m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday."
"9","Beverley: Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th."
"9","Leonard: Oh. You had a party for your 60th?"
"9","Beverley: Oh, I wouldn’t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother."
"9","Penny: You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her."
"9","Beverley: And I never did thank you for that, dear."
"9","Amy: Oh. Penny says everyone’s there. Are you ready?"
"9","Sheldon: I am. Oh. Wait."
"9","Amy: Are you all right?"
"9","Sheldon: No, I just, I got a little light-headed."
"9","Amy: Oh, do you need a minute?"
"9","Sheldon: No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this."
"9","All: Happy birthday!"
"9","Leonard: Speech! Speech!"
"9","Raj: Come on, Sheldon, say something."
"9","Sheldon: Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason."
"9","Leonard: Batman finally came to your party."
"9","Adam: Happy birthday, Sherman."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me."
"9","Adam: I still get paid, don’t I?"
"9","Scene: A little later."
"9","Leonard: Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him."
"9","Amy: Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?"
"9","Leonard: No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time."
"9","Amy: Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on."
"9","Leonard: Again, no offence, but so have I."
"9","Amy: Well, he’s seen me without pants on."
"9","Leonard: Again, no…"
"9","Penny: Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come in?"
"9","(Knocking)"
"9","Sheldon: How do you know I’m not using the facilities?"
"9","Penny: Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what’s going on?"
"9","Sheldon: I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much."
"9","Penny: I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever."
"9","Sheldon: I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it."
"9","Penny: Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it."
"9","Sheldon: I don’t think I can go back out there."
"9","Penny: That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too."
"9","Sheldon: Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it."
"9","Penny: My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you."
"9","Sheldon: Well, everyone will think I’m weird."
"9","Penny: Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re all still here because they care about you so much."
"9","Barry (knocking): Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard’s mother."
"9","(knocking):"
"9","Scene: Later."
"9","Leslie Winkle: Leonard."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Leslie: It’s been a while."
"9","Leonard: Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed."
"9","Leslie: Has it?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married."
"9","Leslie: Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you’d be living with Sheldon forever."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, well, don’t be a stranger."
"9","Penny: Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?"
"9","Barry: What are you wooking at me for? I’m a saint. But a sinner in the sack."
"9","Sheldon: Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand."
"9","Amy: If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born."
"9","General cheers."
"9","Sheldon: Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me."
"9","Howard: Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…"
"9","Sheldon: Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz."
"9","Howard: Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend."
"9","Sheldon: Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go."
"9","Wil: Sheldon, I know that we’ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday."
"9","Sheldon: That’s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s famous and you’re not."
"9","Beverley: Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can’t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear."
"9","Barry: Someone caw Animal Contwol. There’s a cougar on the woose."
"9","Beverley: Barry, stop."
"9","Leonard: Seriously, Barry, stop."
"9","Raj: And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."
"9","Sheldon: And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk."
"9","Leslie: Uh, in the past, I would’ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I’m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it’s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it."
"9","Leslie: Happy birthday, dumbass."
"9","Adam: Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I’m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…"
"9","Bernadette: I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect."
"9","Howard: What? You gotta be kidding me?"
"9","Leonard: Sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you."
"9","Leonard: Happy birthday, buddy."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you. That, that was wonderful."
"9","Penny: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak."
"9","Stuart: Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I’ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone…"
"9","Amy: Hey, everybody, listen up."
"9","Penny: You nailed it."
"9","Amy: We’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday."
"9","Stephen Hawking (on Skype): Hello, Sheldon."
"9","(on Skype)"
"9","Sheldon: Professor Hawking."
"9","Stephen: Happy birthday to you."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, you’re singing. Well, I’m sorry."
"9","Stephen: Happy birthday, dear Sheldon."
"9","Leonard: Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together."
"9","Stephen: I was crushing it, but all right."
"9","Penny: Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug."
"9","Sheldon: You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating."
"9","Leonard: Ready when you are, Professor Hawking."
"9","Stephen: And a one, and a two…"
"9","All: Happy birthday to you,"
"9","Happy birthday to you,"
"9","Happy birthday, dear Sheldon,"
"9","Happy birthday to you."
"9","Adam: So, who’s taking me home?"
"9","Series 09 Episode 18 – The Application Deterioration"
"9","Following a “previously on” sequence."
"9","Scene: Outside the University legal office."
"9","Howard: Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?"
"9","Sheldon: I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression."
"9","Howard: Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?"
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, well, you’re an engineer. End of joke, burn."
"9","Attorney: Come on in, fellas."
"9","Howard: See, he’s not wearing a tie."
"9","Leonard: Well, he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending."
"9","Attorney: So, I’ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we’ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope."
"9","Sheldon: That’s great."
"9","Howard: Excellent."
"9","Leonard: So what happens next?"
"9","Attorney: Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap."
"9","Howard: Oh, I don’t think there will be."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, we did our own search."
"9","Attorney: That’s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough."
"9","Sheldon: Get a load of this guy."
"9","Howard: Can you imagine if we make money with this?"
"9","Leonard: If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy."
"9","Howard: That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose."
"9","Attorney: Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent."
"9","Howard: Seventy-five percent?"
"9","Sheldon: That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?"
"9","Attorney: It’s university policy."
"9","Sheldon: I know when I’m beat."
"9","Leonard: Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?"
"9","Attorney: Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?"
"9","Leonard: Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda."
"9","Attorney: And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I’m afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you’re not entitled to an ownership share."
"9","Howard: Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?"
"9","Attorney: Well, sometimes they give you a plaque."
"9","Sheldon: Well, that’s not fair. We should all get plaques."
"9","Leonard: Sorry, but we can’t sign this."
"9","Howard: Come on, let’s go."
"9","Leonard: Thank you for your time."
"9","Sheldon: Couple of questions about the plaque."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Amy: So, have you been having any morning sickness?"
"9","Bernadette: A little. And it doesn’t help that I’ve got this heightened sense of smell."
"9","Penny: Is that a pregnancy thing?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass."
"9","Penny: But now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with."
"9","Raj: Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do."
"9","Penny: Oh, sure. Let me see it."
"9","Amy: See what?"
"9","Raj: I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note."
"9","Penny: Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily."
"9","Bernadette: That’s nice."
"9","Penny: Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?"
"9","Raj: I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?"
"9","Amy: Why wouldn’t you open it?"
"9","Raj: Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk."
"9","Bernadette: You don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?"
"9","Penny: I know one way to find out. Sniff this."
"9","Amy: She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound."
"9","Bernadette: Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it’s metal."
"9","Penny: Come on, just open it."
"9","Raj: You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box."
"9","Penny: Well, never hurts to have a spare."
"9","Bernadette: What is that?"
"9","Raj: Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars."
"9","Amy: What a nice gift for an astrophysicist."
"9","Raj: I know, she’s so thoughtful."
"9","Penny: See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do."
"9","Raj: You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her."
"9","Amy: You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Leonard: Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?"
"9","Howard: We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with."
"9","Sheldon: Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists."
"9","Leonard: Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all."
"9","Howard: Either way, I get nothing."
"9","Leonard: Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you."
"9","Sheldon: To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs."
"9","Howard: I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?"
"9","Leonard: Of course, we can split any profits three ways."
"9","Sheldon: I’m fine with that."
"9","Howard: Okay, great."
"9","Sheldon: It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order."
"9","Leonard: Sure, we could write something up."
"9","Sheldon: But which one of us should be the party who…"
"9","Howard: You can do it, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: So stipulated."
"9","Leonard: Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird."
"9","Bernadette: I wonder how much she spent on this."
"9","Amy: Ooh, let’s find out."
"9","Raj: It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts."
"9","Penny: Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?"
"9","Raj: Seriously, guys, I don’t want to know."
"9","Amy: Oh, my."
"9","Raj: Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me."
"9","Amy: These things go for five hundred dollars and up."
"9","Bernadette: Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered."
"9","Penny: Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?"
"9","Raj: Maybe you’re right."
"9","Bernadette: Or she’s telling the truth and just being nice."
"9","Raj: Maybe you’re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. (Phone rings) Oh, guys, it’s Emily. What should I do?"
"9","(Phone rings)"
"9","Penny: Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear."
"9","Raj: Hello?"
"9","Emily (voice): Hey, it’s Emily. Is this a good time?"
"9","(voice)"
"9","Raj: Yeah, yeah. Sure. What’s up?"
"9","Emily: Was it okay I left that gift? I’m really hoping we can be friends."
"9","Raj: Maybe, maybe."
"9","Emily: Um, you think you’d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?"
"9","Raj: I’m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this."
"9","Emily: I just, I miss hanging out with you. It’s not like I lost a friend, it’s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you’d want to come over?"
"9","Raj: I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea."
"9","Emily: Okay. I’m just, I’m having a really hard time, but that’s not your problem, that’s mine. I, I won’t bother you again, but please know that you’ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You’re a good guy."
"9","Raj: Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys."
"9","Penny: I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of you."
"9","Raj: Well, anyway, I’ll leave you to your girls’ night."
"9","Amy: Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?"
"9","Raj: No, I kind of feel like being alone right now."
"9","Bernadette: Well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here."
"9","Raj: Thank you."
"9","Penny: Say hi to Emily for us."
"9","Raj: Will do."
"9","Howard: This contract looks good to me."
"9","Sheldon: I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica."
"9","Leonard: I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes."
"9","Bernadette: I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?"
"9","Howard: Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract."
"9","Bernadette: What is it?"
"9","Howard: Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally."
"9","Penny: Sheldon, did you draft the contract?"
"9","Sheldon: You bet I did."
"9","Penny: Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight."
"9","Bernadette: So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?"
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now."
"9","Bernadette: I know, but…"
"9","Howard: Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out."
"9","Bernadette: Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea."
"9","Amy: Well, to be fair, Howard’s idea was based on Sheldon’s math."
"9","Leonard: Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard’s invention, Sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now."
"9","Penny: What?"
"9","Howard: Honey, this is fine."
"9","Bernadette: If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead."
"9","Howard: Can I talk to you in the hall?"
"9","Bernadette: Sure."
"9","Howard: Excuse us."
"9","Sheldon: Hey, Leonard."
"9","Leonard: What?"
"9","Sheldon: If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd."
"9","Leonard: Good one."
"9","Sheldon: Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker."
"9","Howard: What are you doing?"
"9","Bernadette: I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through."
"9","Howard: What’s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward."
"9","Bernadette: Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper."
"9","Howard: All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself."
"9","Bernadette: I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do."
"9","Howard: Here we go with the ironclad logic again."
"9","Bernadette: You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?"
"9","Howard: Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that’s cheating."
"9","Scene: Raj’s car."
"9","Raj (answering phone): Hello?"
"9","(answering phone)"
"9","Claire: Hey, Raj. It’s Claire. How are you?"
"9","Raj: Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really."
"9","Claire: Really?"
"9","Raj: I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?"
"9","Claire: Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn’t work out."
"9","Raj: Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words."
"9","Claire: So if you were still interested."
"9","Raj: Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?"
"9","Claire: Uh, I’m almost off work. What are you doing now?"
"9","Raj: Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything."
"9","Claire: Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn’t have her best friend to talk to any more?"
"9","Raj: That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?"
"9","Claire: I’m a girl. It’s, like, page one out of the playbook."
"9","Raj: Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?"
"9","Leonard: They’ve been out there a while."
"9","Amy: I hope everything’s okay."
"9","Sheldon: I wonder what they’re talking about."
"9","Penny: If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
"9","Howard: Hey."
"9","Sheldon: Hello."
"9","Leonard: You guys all right?"
"9","Howard: Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership."
"9","Sheldon: Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming."
"9","Howard: Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It’s, it’s with how you treat me."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own."
"9","Bernadette: Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?"
"9","Sheldon: No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that."
"9","Howard: See? This is what happens every time we work together."
"9","Penny: You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?"
"9","Leonard: What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?"
"9","Penny: No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard."
"9","Bernadette: How would you enforce it?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
"9","Amy: And his obsessive-compulsive disorder."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow’s on my spot."
"9","Leonard: Howard, what do you think?"
"9","Howard: I’m on board."
"9","Sheldon: I’ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it’s addendum time."
"9","Emily (voice): Hello?"
"9","Raj: Hey, Emily, listen, I’ve been thinking, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over."
"9","Emily: Oh. Okay. I understand."
"9","Raj: No, no. Please don’t cry."
"9","Emily: Okay, I’ll stop."
"9","fade"
"9","Claire: Hello?"
"9","Raj: Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…"
"9","Claire: Fine. Do what you want, but she’s playing you."
"9","Raj: I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset."
"9","Claire: You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I’m having such a rough day."
"9","Raj: Emily, listen, I’m sorry, but I can’t come by."
"9","Emily: Why not?"
"9","Raj: I think we both know if I come over, we’re gonna get back together and…"
"9","Emily: I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?"
"9","Raj: Call you right back."
"9","Sheldon: The, the revisions I made start on page four."
"9","Penny: Wow. That is a lot of whereupons."
"9","Amy: You should see the Valentine’s Day card he gave me."
"9","Howard: Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad."
"9","Leonard: Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too."
"9","Sheldon: Do you still like cilantro?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: You’re tying my hands here."
"9","Howard: All right, let’s sign this."
"9","Penny: Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon, what did you do?"
"9","Howard: I should’ve known."
"9","Bernadette: 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that’s so nice."
"9","Leonard: That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap."
"9","Howard: That’s very generous, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I’ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I’ve been of your contributions."
"9","Howard: I appreciate that."
"9","Sheldon: And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer."
"9","Amy: Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: What? I didn’t sign it yet."
"9","Raj: I hear what you’re saying, but I’ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt."
"9","Claire: All right, it’s your life. But you know how this is gonna end."
"9","Raj: As a matter of fact, I do. I’m gonna comfort her, because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to."
"9","Scene: Emily’s bed."
"9","Raj: Good talk."

"9","Amy (on Skype): I didn’t understand your e-mail."
"9","(on Skype)"
"9","Sheldon: Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up."
"9","Amy: I didn’t understand your e-mail."
"9","Sheldon: Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working."
"9","Amy: Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"
"9","Sheldon: So, is that a yes?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that one’s out-of-date."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, but I like this computer."
"9","Amy: The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
"9","Sheldon: I’m sorry, I didn’t get that."
"9","Sheldon: The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing."
"9","Amy: Get a new computer."
"9","Sheldon: What?"
"9","Sheldon: What? (Answering phone) Hello?"
"9","(Answering phone)"
"9","Amy (on phone) Get a new computer."

"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Howard’s workshop."
"9","Leonard: This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?"
"9","Howard: Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room."
"9","Leonard: If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set."
"9","Penny: Hey, guys."
"9","Leonard: Hey. What are you doing here?"
"9","Bernadette: We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend."
"9","Penny: Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em."
"9","Leonard: Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make."
"9","Penny: So, how’s it goin’?"
"9","Leonard: Good. Slow."
"9","Howard: There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker."
"9","Penny: Is there anything we can do to help?"
"9","Leonard: You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could."
"9","Penny: Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then."
"9","Bernadette: Can we really help?"
"9","Howard: While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape."
"9","Leonard: I’ll show you how to do one."
"9","Penny: Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny."
"9","Amy: I got here as quickly as I could."
"9","Sheldon: You’re too late."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, this is silly."
"9","Sheldon: You got emotional when that lab monkey died."
"9","Amy: That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language."
"9","Sheldon: Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day."
"9","Amy: Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer."
"9","Sheldon: How could you do that?"
"9","Amy: Do what?"
"9","Sheldon: Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I lost enough today?"
"9","Amy: Well, the guy at the store said this one is great."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?"
"9","Amy: Yes."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?"
"9","Sheldon: Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?"
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, well, he does know his stuff."
"9","Leonard: After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal."
"9","Penny: Like this?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah, perfect."
"9","Penny: Oh."
"9","Leonard: And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard."
"9","Howard: I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards."
"9","Leonard: We had a full spool yesterday."
"9","Howard: What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder."
"9","Bernadette: Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It’s like a beer commercial."
"9","Leonard: Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store."
"9","Penny: How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?"
"9","Leonard: Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…"
"9","Penny: Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story."
"9","Howard: You want to come with us?"
"9","Bernadette: I’m kind of getting into the groove here."
"9","Penny: Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change."
"9","Leonard: Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can."
"9","Penny: Okay, so what is solder?"
"9","Sheldon: I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?"
"9","Amy: Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W."
"9","Sheldon: You wouldn’t."
"9","Amy: Whatch me."
"9","Sheldon: Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast."
"9","Amy: I thought you might like it."
"9","Sheldon: Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs."
"9","Amy: Or you could just look into my eyes."
"9","Sheldon: But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs."
"9","Amy: Well, you know, as long as you’re happy."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. I am."
"9","Amy: And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you."
"9","Amy: Oh, but he said you can get store credit."
"9","Sheldon: Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit."
"9","Amy: But why wouldn’t…"
"9","Sheldon: Can we please change the subject?"
"9","Amy: Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain."
"9","Amy: Sheldon, just tell me."
"9","Sheldon: It might be easier to show you."
"9","Amy: Okay."
"9","Sheldon: We’d have to take your car."
"9","Amy: All right."
"9","Sheldon: And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement."
"9","Amy: Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?"
"9","Scene: A street."
"9","Leonard: Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype."
"9","Howard: Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?"
"9","Leonard: I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection."
"9","Man: Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?"
"9","Leonard: Oh. Sorry, we can’t."
"9","Howard: Well, hang on. What movie is it?"
"9","Man: Oh, I can’t tell you. But it does star Will Smith."
"9","Howard: Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out."
"9","Leonard: What about the girls?"
"9","Howard: Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?"
"9","Leonard: Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original."
"9","Penny: I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system."
"9","Bernadette: It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three."
"9","Raj: Hey. Where are the guys?"
"9","Penny: Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things."
"9","Bernadette: Since when do you work on weekends?"
"9","Raj: I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off."
"9","Penny: You were home alone and had no one to play with?"
"9","Raj: Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?"
"9","Bernadette: Not with Lightning McQueen here."
"9","Penny: I think we’re good."
"9","Raj: Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So, see ya."
"9","Bernadette: I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?"
"9","Raj (from outside): Yes."
"9","(from outside)"
"9","Scene: Amy’s car."
"9","Amy: Will you please tell me where we’re going?"
"9","Sheldon: Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis."
"9","Amy: I’m driving the car. I need to know."
"9","Sheldon: Right."
"9","Amy: So where are we going?"
"9","Sheldon: No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know."
"9","Scene: The cinema."
"9","Leonard: What are we gonna tell the girls?"
"9","Howard: It’s not a problem."
"9","Leonard: I mean without lying."
"9","Howard: And now you’ve made it a problem."
"9","Leonard: Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad."
"9","Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text): Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat."
"9","(at Howard’s workshop, reading text)"
"9","Leonard: They bought it."
"9","Howard: But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back."
"9","Leonard: Oh, you’re good at this."
"9","Howard: Well, I lie a lot."
"9","Man: Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You’re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad."
"9","Leonard: Hey, you were right."
"9","Howard: Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people."
"9","Man: Uh, we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy."
"9","Leonard: Who are you texting?"
"9","Howard: Raj. He really wants to see this movie."
"9","Leonard: He’ll never make it in time."
"9","Howard: I know. I want to make him feel bad."
"9","Leonard: Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend."
"9","Raj (at the workshop): Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?"
"9","(at the workshop)"
"9","Penny: Why?"
"9","Raj: I need to rub my genitals on their prototype."
"9","Bernadette: What’s going on?"
"9","Raj: Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look."
"9","Penny: Un-freakin’ believable."
"9","Bernadette: Son of a bitch."
"9","Raj: Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted."
"9","Penny: No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it."
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves."
"9","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"9","Raj: Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it."
"9","Scene: A storage facility."
"9","Amy: Why do you have a storage unit?"
"9","Sheldon: Just wait."
"9","Amy: How long have you had it?"
"9","Amy: Do you want me to hold that computer?"
"9","Sheldon: Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame."
"9","Amy: I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?"
"9","Sheldon: It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it."
"9","Amy: All of it?"
"9","Sheldon: I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags."
"9","Amy: Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute."
"9","Penny: All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?"
"9","Raj: I know. You guys should totally be making out with me."
"9","Penny: Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?"
"9","Raj: No, ma’am."
"9","Bernadette: Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out."
"9","Penny: Yeah, that’s pretty good."
"9","Raj: I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either."
"9","Scene: The storage unit."
"9","Sheldon: In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment."
"9","Amy: You have sporting equipment?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent."
"9","Amy: Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?"
"9","Sheldon: I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head."
"9","Amy: So, why do you feel you need to save these things?"
"9","Sheldon: I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…"
"9","Amy: Okay. I get it. I get it."
"9","Sheldon: It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me."
"9","Amy: I don’t."
"9","Sheldon: Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me."
"9","Amy: Why?"
"9","Sheldon: Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?"
"9","Amy: It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too."
"9","Sheldon: Like what?"
"9","Amy: Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?"
"9","Sheldon: I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years."
"9","Amy: It’s not a contest."
"9","Penny: Okay, here they come."
"9","Bernadette: Go hide."
"9","Raj: Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Howard: Hi."
"9","Penny: Hey, what’s this?"
"9","Leonard: Listen, we did a stupid thing."
"9","Howard: We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you."
"9","Leonard: So, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner."
"9","Howard: Yeah. Anywhere you want."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. Well, thank you for being honest."
"9","Penny: Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype."
"9","Raj (inside cupboard): Don’t forgive them. Stay mad at them."
"9","(inside cupboard)"
"9","Howard: What is he doing in there?"
"9","Raj: Busting you."
"9","Bernadette: It’s okay. They apologized."
"9","Penny: Yeah, it’s fine."
"9","Raj: Well this is kind of anti-climactic."
"9","Howard: You know what wasn’t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this."
"9","Raj: No spoilers. No spoilers."
"9","Penny: And he’s back in the closet."
"9","Howard: Ready for dinner?"
"9","Penny: Yeah."
"9","Bernadette: Should we invite Raj?"
"9","Raj (in cupboard): Yes."
"9","(in cupboard)"
"9","Amy: So, no one else knows about this?"
"9","Sheldon: Only you."
"9","Amy: Thank you for trusting me."
"9","Sheldon: What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?"
"9","Amy: That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for you."
"9","Sheldon: Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin."
"9","Amy: Baby steps, I guess."
"9","Sheldon: I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball."
"9","Amy: Oh. Okay."
"9","Sheldon: I will always have the dent to remember it by."
"9","Amy: You did it. Do you feel okay?"
"9","Sheldon: Actually, yes. I do."
"9","Amy: Well, I’m proud of you."
"9","Sheldon: Thanks."
"9","Sheldon: I’m glad I told you about the storage unit."
"9","Amy: Well, I feel closer to you now."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime."
"9","Amy: What did you have in mind?"
"9","Scene: The same, shortly afterwards."
"9","Sheldon: You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable."
"9","Amy (on Skype): I really had to go home for this?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room."
"9","Amy: And yet, I’m not."
"9","Sheldon: But I feel like I could reach out and touch you."
"9","Amy: And yet, you can’t."
"9","Sheldon: I know."
"9","Series 09 Episode 20 – The Big Bear Precipitation"
"9","Scene: The apartment (initially inside a virtual reality device)"
"9","Sheldon: It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!"
"9","Leonard: Whatcha doing?"
"9","Sheldon: I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face."
"9","Penny: What am I smelling?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest."
"9","Penny: That’s not what the forest smells like."
"9","Sheldon: Well, how would I know?"
"9","Leonard: Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it."
"9","Sheldon: Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness."
"9","Leonard: Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there."
"9","Sheldon: Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return."
"9","Penny: Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?"
"9","Sheldon: You may need this more than I do."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Amy: Here’s your tea."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log."
"9","Amy: You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?"
"9","Sheldon: Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…"
"9","Penny: You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me."
"9","Leonard: Because he’s hitting on you?"
"9","Penny: She."
"9","Leonard: Oh, good."
"9","Penny: But I could get her."
"9","Amy: We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me."
"9","Leonard: You and I could still go and have a nice weekend."
"9","Penny: Sure."
"9","Amy: Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them."
"9","Sheldon: I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars."
"9","Penny: I’ll see if it’s available."
"9","Amy: You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you."
"9","Sheldon: Are you trying to manipulate me?"
"9","Amy: Yes."
"9","Sheldon: Well done, it worked, we’re going."
"9","Amy: Yay."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Bernadette: Come on, Raj, give me a bag."
"9","Raj: No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow."
"9","Howard: Hey, where you been?"
"9","Bernadette: Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store."
"9","Howard: Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?"
"9","Bernadette: Yes and yes."
"9","Howard: I didn’t know you needed help running errands today."
"9","Bernadette: I didn’t, but Raj volunteered."
"9","Howard: Really?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me."
"9","Howard: Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet."
"9","Raj: Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think."
"9","Howard: And it just got weird."
"9","Penny: Hey. Amy’s downstairs."
"9","Leonard: Okay, one sec."
"9","Penny: Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?"
"9","Leonard: I bought a baseball cap."
"9","Penny: I can see that. What team did you get?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter."
"9","Penny: Well, we’ll be in the woods."
"9","Sheldon: I’m ready to go."
"9","Leonard: Anything you’d like to say to him?"
"9","Penny: Nice hat, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Thanks."
"9","Leonard: Why are you so mean to me?"
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen. Screams are emanating from Bernadette’s tablet."
"9","Howard: What the hell are you watching?"
"9","Bernadette: Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river."
"9","Howard: Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?"
"9","Bernadette: I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience."
"9","Howard: All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?"
"9","Bernadette: Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat."
"9","Howard: Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?"
"9","Bernadette: Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here."
"9","Howard: So he can be part of the experience?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah."
"9","Howard: I’m surprised he let us conceive without him."
"9","Bernadette: It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up."
"9","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"9","Penny: It’s so cute and rustic up here."
"9","Leonard: I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg."
"9","Sheldon: Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time."
"9","Amy: Have you ever been off the grid before?"
"9","Sheldon: Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on."
"9","Leonard: I was afraid he was gonna eat me."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment."
"9","Howard: Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him."
"9","Bernadette: Leave it alone. He means well."
"9","Howard: So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?"
"9","Bernadette: No, not really."
"9","Howard: And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?"
"9","Bernadette: He’s just trying to be supportive."
"9","Howard: Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?"
"9","Bernadette: No."
"9","Raj: Hello."
"9","Bernadette: You saw him carrying that."
"9","Howard: Astronauts saw him carrying that."
"9","Scene: The cabin."
"9","Penny: This place is great."
"9","Leonard: So nice of that doctor to just let you use it."
"9","Penny: Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought."
"9","Sheldon: Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?"
"9","Amy: Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?"
"9","Amy: On the other hand, safety first."
"9","Scene: The same, later."
"9","Amy: Wow, it’s really coming down."
"9","Penny: This sucks."
"9","Leonard: And there goes our hike."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm."
"9","Penny: You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us."
"9","Leonard: Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?"
"9","Penny: No."
"9","Leonard: You’ll wish it would kill you."
"9","Amy: So what do we do now?"
"9","Leonard: They have some board games."
"9","Sheldon: Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on."
"9","Penny: Hey, let’s light a fire."
"9","Amy: Ooh, that sounds cozy."
"9","Leonard: I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before."
"9","Sheldon: Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out."
"9","Leonard: I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow."
"9","Sheldon: That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion."
"9","Leonard: Right. So all we need is to…"
"9","Penny: Got it."
"9","Leonard: A scientist made that."
"9","Howard: Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby."
"9","Raj: Please, my pleasure."
"9","Bernadette: And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this."
"9","Howard: But we have to set some boundaries."
"9","Raj: I don’t understand."
"9","Howard: The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us."
"9","Howard: Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off."
"9","Howard: Thanks for understanding."
"9","Raj: Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way."
"9","Howard: You need some help?"
"9","Raj: No, I got it."
"9","Bernadette: Raj, Raj, wait."
"9","Raj: Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity."
"9","Penny: Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game."
"9","Penny: Not the drinking game, a drinking game."
"9","Leonard: To be fair, good at both."
"9","Amy: What’s the game?"
"9","Penny: All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink."
"9","Leonard: I’ve never played that before."
"9","Sheldon: Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?"
"9","Penny: Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…"
"9","Amy: She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while."
"9","Penny: Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back."
"9","Leonard: Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested."
"9","Sheldon: So I drink."
"9","Amy: No, it’s only if you’ve done it."
"9","Sheldon: Got it."
"9","Amy: I can’t believe you’ve been arrested."
"9","Sheldon: I can’t believe Penny hasn’t."
"9","Penny: Sheldon, what did you do?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked."
"9","Leonard: Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac."
"9","Amy: I’m surprised you would do that."
"9","Sheldon: No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing."
"9","Penny: What, he arrested you for that?"
"9","Sheldon: No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer."
"9","Penny: And then you got arrested."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, and how."
"9","Howard: I feel like I just made a horrible mistake."
"9","Howard: But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little."
"9","Howard: What? Are you gonna cry?"
"9","Howard: Is it baby hormones or actually sad?"
"9","Bernadette: I can’t tell anymore."
"9","Howard: I’ll go get him."
"9","Bernadette: And bring back the bear."
"9","Leonard: This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble."
"9","Penny: How?"
"9","Leonard: Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink."
"9","Penny: Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals."
"9","Leonard: Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks."
"9","Amy: Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed."
"9","Sheldon: Amy."
"9","Amy: You know the rules. Drink."
"9","Penny: Yeah, go ahead."
"9","Leonard: That’s right."
"9","Sheldon: All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won."
"9","Penny: I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?"
"9","Leonard: I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside."
"9","Penny: We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything."
"9","Leonard: What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m calling it. I won."
"9","Raj: I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds."
"9","Howard: No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here."
"9","Bernadette: I hear that."
"9","Raj: Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?"
"9","Howard: Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat."
"9","Raj: Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?"
"9","Bernadette: Of course."
"9","Raj: Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?"
"9","Howard: Hey, look at that. It’s weird again."
"9","Leonard: Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me."
"9","Penny: How long have you had this secret account?"
"9","Leonard: A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies."
"9","Penny: Well, how much you got in there?"
"9","Leonard: Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here."
"9","Penny: My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?"
"9","Leonard: No, I do, and that’s why I hid it."
"9","Penny: What good is it if you don’t use it?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret."
"9","Penny: Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too."
"9","Leonard: Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome."
"9","Penny: I hate my job."
"9","Leonard: Really? Why?"
"9","Penny: Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while."
"9","Leonard: Why didn’t you tell me?"
"9","Penny: Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success."
"9","Leonard: That’s not true."
"9","Penny: Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?"
"9","Leonard: If that’s what you want to do, yes."
"9","Penny: Well, it’s not what I want to do."
"9","Leonard: Oh, yes."
"9","Penny: Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through."
"9","Leonard: Well, that is the grown-up thing."
"9","Penny: I guess."
"9","Leonard: I love you."
"9","Penny: I love you, too."
"9","Leonard: You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining."
"9","Penny: Well, guess I gotta drink."
"9","Howard: All right, here we go."
"9","Bernadette: I’m not hearing anything."
"9","Howard: Well, give me a second."
"9","Raj: Are you sure you can do this?"
"9","Howard: Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?"
"9","Raj: I buried it there, so we could go home."
"9","Bernadette: Wait, that’s it."
"9","Raj: Wow."
"9","Bernadette: Isn’t that the best?"
"9","Raj: You guys made a person."
"9","Howard: We did."
"9","Raj: And I like to think I helped."
"9","Howard: You didn’t."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date."
"9","Amy: Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean."
"9","Amy: Never have I ever honked if I liked anything."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee."
"9","Amy: Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first."
"9","Sheldon: Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator."
"9","Amy: Well, we all have a past."
"9","Series 09 Episode 21 – The Viewing Party Combustion"
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Sheldon: I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?"
"9","Leonard: No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat."
"9","Raj: But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?"
"9","Howard: But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man."
"9","Sheldon: Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?"
"9","Leonard: But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?"
"9","Raj: Well, that’s just Batman."
"9","Leonard: No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man."
"9","Howard: So does that answer your question?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I haven’t asked it yet."
"9","Raj (checking text on phone): Oh, that’s Claire. Got to run."
"9","(checking text on phone)"
"9","Leonard: I thought you were back with Emily."
"9","Raj: Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them."
"9","Leonard: You mean like through their window from behind a bush?"
"9","Raj: No, I’m actually dating two women. Later."
"9","Leonard: Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?"
"9","Howard: I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up."
"9","Leonard: Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?"
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Sheldon: What, why did you get a party sub?"
"9","Leonard: People are coming over, it looked fun."
"9","Sheldon: Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party."
"9","Leonard: Your attendance implies it’s not."
"9","Sheldon: I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting."
"9","Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months."
"9","Sheldon: Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow."
"9","Leonard: Oh, you know what? I’m not going."
"9","Sheldon: Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance."
"9","Leonard: This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure."
"9","Sheldon: You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins."
"9","Leonard: You’re the only one who eats them."
"9","Sheldon: And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?"
"9","Leonard: I’m not going, you can’t make me."
"9","Sheldon: Well, we’ll just see about that."
"9","Penny: What is the problem?"
"9","Sheldon: He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow."
"9","Penny: Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?"
"9","Leonard: You have fun. I will not be attending."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to."
"9","Leonard: Thank you."
"9","Sheldon: Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel."
"9","Leonard: You’re being ridiculous."
"9","Sheldon: There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing."
"9","Leonard: Can you please talk to him?"
"9","Penny: Well, why are you fighting him on this?"
"9","Leonard: Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party."
"9","Penny: Well, I will still come to your meeting."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day."
"9","Leonard: Why are you taking his side?"
"9","Penny: Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal."
"9","Sheldon: You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house."
"9","Raj: Man, I’m worn out."
"9","Howard: I know. Imagine if we were actually moving."
"9","Raj: No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting."
"9","Howard: You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it."
"9","Raj: But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love."
"9","Howard: I guess I am lucky."
"9","Raj: You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?"
"9","Bernadette: Hey, Raj."
"9","Raj: Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?"
"9","Bernadette: Good. A little tired."
"9","Raj: I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women."
"9","Howard: You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?"
"9","Bernadette: You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book."
"9","Raj: Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like."
"9","Sheldon: Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?"
"9","Penny: Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off."
"9","Penny: Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting."
"9","Leonard: Leave me alone."
"9","Penny: If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went."
"9","Leonard: Not funny."
"9","Penny: You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, of course, because I’m the only adult around here."
"9","Penny: Really? The only adult?"
"9","Leonard: Yeah, that’s right."
"9","Sheldon: Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster."
"9","Penny: All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night."
"9","Leonard: And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed."
"9","Sheldon: All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting."
"9","Leonard: I don’t want to."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting."
"9","Leonard: Stop saying meeting."
"9","Sheldon: Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting."
"9","Amy: I brought my famous spinach dip."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting."
"9","Scene: Howard’s car."
"9","Howard: I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are."
"9","Raj: Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog."
"9","Howard: There you go again."
"9","Raj: I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?"
"9","Howard: Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag."
"9","Raj: How could you say that?"
"9","Howard: Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."
"9","Raj: I never said that."
"9","Howard: Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?"
"9","Raj: Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her."
"9","Amy: What’s going on with him?"
"9","Penny: Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting."
"9","Sheldon: Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more."
"9","Penny: Don’t worry, he’ll come around."
"9","Amy: Well, I get why he’s annoyed."
"9","Sheldon: Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like."
"9","Leonard: You love The Simpsons."
"9","Sheldon: I love Lisa Simpson."
"9","Amy: Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings."
"9","Sheldon: Wait. You were pretending?"
"9","Amy: Sorry."
"9","Sheldon: No. I don’t believe you. I could tell."
"9","Amy: Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."
"9","Sheldon: Hmm, what do you think?"
"9","Penny: You don’t know?"
"9","Scene: The stairwell."
"9","Raj: Hey, did I say something to upset you?"
"9","Howard: No, I’m fine."
"9","Raj: Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom."
"9","Howard: Just drop it."
"9","Raj: Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me."
"9","Howard: Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?"
"9","Raj: It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with."
"9","Penny: Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here."
"9","Sheldon: Gladly."
"9","Leonard: Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character."
"9","Sheldon: It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann."
"9","Howard: Wait, what is going on?"
"9","Penny: Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here."
"9","Amy: Do you guys want to watch with us?"
"9","Howard: As long as I don’t have to watch with him."
"9","Raj: Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here."
"9","Howard: Why do you get to pick?"
"9","Raj: Okay, then you go there."
"9","Howard: Don’t tell me where to go."
"9","Leonard: Howard, just come in here."
"9","Penny: Yeah, come on, Raj."
"9","Raj: Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?"
"9","Sheldon: She did."
"9","Howard: And I’m gonna eat it all."
"9","Howard: So what the hell happened?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense."
"9","Howard: Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too."
"9","Amy: You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability."
"9","Howard: Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period."
"9","Leonard: If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly. (Knock on door) Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize."
"9","(Knock on door)"
"9","Stuart: Hey, Leonard."
"9","Leonard: Stuart."
"9","Stuart: Uh, is this not a dress-up party?"
"9","Leonard: No."
"9","Stuart: Was it ever a dress-up party?"
"9","Stuart: Howard, didn’t you tell me it was a dress-up party?"
"9","Howard: Yeah."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment. Knock on door."
"9","Stuart: I was told this is where to go if I’m mad at Howard."
"9","Penny: May I take your cloak?"
"9","Stuart: Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard."
"9","Stuart: So what happened with you and Howard?"
"9","Raj: Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous."
"9","Stuart: I’m jealous. Closest I’ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman."
"9","Leonard: I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy."
"9","Howard: Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on."
"9","Leonard: Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me."
"9","Amy: Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less."
"9","Leonard: Sorry?"
"9","Amy: Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are."
"9","Leonard: Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close."
"9","Amy: Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?"
"9","Leonard: Penny, but…"
"9","Amy: Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?"
"9","Leonard: I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out."
"9","Amy: Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?"
"9","Leonard: Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?"
"9","Howard: I don’t know. I like the pain of others."
"9","Leonard: Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali."
"9","Howard: No, she doesn’t."
"9","Leonard: She defends him all the time."
"9","Howard: She does not."
"9","Amy: Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?"
"9","Howard: Well, she did. And human resources."
"9","Leonard: Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?"
"9","Howard: Son of a bitch."
"9","Leonard: You’re, you’re right, it feels good."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Raj: All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?"
"9","Stuart: Two women, huh?"
"9","Sheldon (at knock on door): Oh, perhaps it’s Amy coming to her senses."
"9","(at knock on door)"
"9","Penny: What’s up?"
"9","Leonard: You know, you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement."
"9","Penny: Where’d you get that from?"
"9","Leonard: From Amy."
"9","Penny: Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?"
"9","Amy: Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do."
"9","Penny: I don’t always defend Sheldon."
"9","Leonard: Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him."
"9","Penny: What about your weird relationship with him?"
"9","Leonard: That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV."
"9","Howard: Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?"
"9","Leonard: I don’t think so. Why?"
"9","Howard: Well just a feeling."
"9","Scene: A hospital waiting room."
"9","Leonard: It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it."
"9","Sheldon: Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death."
"9","Amy: Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster."
"9","Bernadette: He’s gonna be okay."
"9","Sheldon: Now it’s a fun fact."
"9","Stuart: Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective."
"9","Bernadette: Why are you dressed like that?"
"9","Stuart: Oh, uh, Howard thought it’d be funny to tell me it was a costume party."
"9","Bernadette: That wasn’t nice."
"9","Stuart: No, but he almost died, so we’re cool."
"9","Raj: You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones."
"9","Amy: How?"
"9","Raj: Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned."
"9","Penny: Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident."
"9","Raj: Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding."
"9","Sheldon: Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store."
"9","Raj: Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch, and they don’t have sex."
"9","Penny: There you go."
"9","Leonard: That’s true."
"9","Sheldon: Fair enough."
"9","Howard: Hey."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Bernadette: You all right?"
"9","Howard: I’m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks."
"9","Leonard: Let’s get out of here."
"9","Amy: That was scary."
"9","Sheldon: Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right."
"9","Scene: The street."
"9","Raj (shouting from upstairs window): Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?"
"9","(shouting from upstairs window)"
"9","Stuart: How come your head has your face on it?"
"9","Sheldon: They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety."
"9","Stuart: Don’t you guys have anything better to do?"
"9","Leonard: Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope."
"9","Stuart: That’s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid… aaargh!"
"9","Scene: Leonard’s bedroom."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard."
"9","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"9","Leonard: What?"
"9","Sheldon: I never got to ask my question about Batman."
"9","Leonard: What is it?"
"9","Sheldon: If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?"
"9","Penny: Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?"
"9","Sheldon: I’ll be back."
"9","Series 09 Episode 22 – The Fermentation Bifurcation"
"9","Scene: The apartment"
"9","Penny: Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work."
"9","Leonard: That sounds fun."
"9","Penny: Mm-hmm."
"9","Leonard: How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?"
"9","Howard: ‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies."
"9","Sheldon: Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery."
"9","Amy: But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize."
"9","Sheldon: I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember."
"9","Penny: All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go."
"9","Raj: I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir."
"9","Leonard: I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken."
"9","Amy: Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go."
"9","Sheldon: Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box."
"9","Amy: Well, I’m going. You couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now."
"9","Sheldon: I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man."
"9","Amy: And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall."
"9","Penny: The little choo-choo for toddlers?"
"9","Amy: And now you know why I needed the massage."
"9","Howard: Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on."
"9","Bernadette: It’s okay, you should go."
"9","Howard: You sure?"
"9","Bernadette: Of course."
"9","Penny: Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on."
"9","Sheldon: Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me."
"9","Bernadette: Me? How? Why?"
"9","Sheldon: Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup."
"9","Bernadette: Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to."
"9","Leonard: The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out."
"9","Bernadette: I guess we could give it a try."
"9","Sheldon: Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly."
"9","Howard: I bet you’d like a drink right now."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: Howard’s workshop"
"9","Raj: Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?"
"9","Leonard: Sure. I’d like to meet her."
"9","Raj: Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, but I won’t be there."
"9","Raj: Funny how that worked out."
"9","Leonard: Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?"
"9","Raj: No, I’m still dating her."
"9","Leonard: Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?"
"9","Raj: They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions."
"9","Sheldon: You know, it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia."
"9","Leonard: Who’s Frank and Alicia?"
"9","Sheldon: You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?"
"9","Howard: Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready."
"9","Sheldon: I am going to record this for posterity."
"9","Leonard: All right, here goes nothing."
"9","Sheldon: Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?"
"9","Leonard: Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing."
"9","Sheldon: Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post."
"9","Raj: It’s, it’s beautiful."
"9","Howard: Actually, it’s making me dizzy."
"9","Leonard: Good, it’s not just me."
"9","Scene: Raj’s apartment."
"9","Claire (on phone): Hello."
"9","(on phone)"
"9","Raj: Hey, Claire."
"9","Claire: Hey, what’s up?"
"9","Raj: Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting."
"9","Claire: Sure, I guess. If you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step."
"9","Raj: Why would it be too big a step?"
"9","Claire: I don’t know. I just don’t want things to get weird."
"9","Raj: Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart."
"9","Claire: Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don’t like me? What if they like me and I don’t like them?"
"9","Raj: Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Penny: Hey, you ready to go?"
"9","Leonard: Hang on."
"9","Penny: What are you doing?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for."
"9","Penny: You actually smell the wine?"
"9","Leonard: I mostly just smell my nasal spray."
"9","Penny: Are your sinuses acting up?"
"9","Leonard: Since my preschool got a bunny."
"9","Penny: Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves."
"9","Penny: Oh, good for you."
"9","Sheldon: Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby."
"9","Penny: No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection."
"9","Leonard: Okay, have fun."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury."
"9","Leonard: We’re leaving now!"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes."
"9","Penny: Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye."
"9","Sheldon: Boy, do I love restrictions."
"9","Scene: The wine tasting."
"9","Howard: Hey. Where is everybody?"
"9","Amy: Oh, we’re the first ones here."
"9","Howard: Oh. Cool."
"9","Amy: Yeah. Cool."
"9","Howard: You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out."
"9","Amy: Oh, I do. It was three years ago."
"9","Howard: Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are."
"9","Amy: So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out."
"9","Howard: I know. What are they gonna talk about?"
"9","Amy: I don’t know. I really don’t know."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Howard: Oh, good."
"9","Amy: Oh, thank God."
"9","Penny: You guys been here long?"
"9","Howard: No, two minutes."
"9","Amy: But yes."
"9","Howard: Where’s Claire?"
"9","Raj: Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual."
"9","Leonard: Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?"
"9","Raj: Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma."
"9","Amy: Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?"
"9","Penny: Oh, yeah."
"9","Amy: Are you gonna say hi to him?"
"9","Penny: Uh, I don’t know."
"9","Raj: Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener."
"9","Bernadette: I brought sparkling cider."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it."
"9","Bernadette: So what do you want to do tonight?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast."
"9","Bernadette: There’s more than one?"
"9","Sheldon: You’ve heard of French toast?"
"9","Bernadette: Yeah."
"9","Sheldon: Cinnamon toast?"
"9","Sheldon: Melba toast?"
"9","Sheldon: You get where I’m going here?"
"9","Amy: I’m getting an earthy note."
"9","Penny: Ah, there’s definitely some oak."
"9","Raj: Also, uh, cherries?"
"9","Leonard: I smell nothing."
"9","Howard: Really? Nothing?"
"9","Leonard: Just a whole lot of Afrin."
"9","Zack: Penny?"
"9","Penny: Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack."
"9","Howard: Yeah, hey, buddy."
"9","Amy: Hello."
"9","Raj: Hey."
"9","Zack: Hey, did you two get married?"
"9","Penny: We did."
"9","Leonard: Yeah, mm-hmm."
"9","Zack: To each other?"
"9","Penny: Yes."
"9","Zack: Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two."
"9","Leonard: Thanks."
"9","Zack: So how’s the science world? What are you guys up to?"
"9","Howard: We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented."
"9","Leonard: But we won’t bore you with the details."
"9","Zack: Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson."
"9","Amy: Mike deGrasse Tyson?"
"9","Howard: Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist."
"9","Zack: So what’s your invention?"
"9","Howard: Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems."
"9","Leonard: What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely."
"9","Zack: Angular momentum. I was wondering about that."
"9","Howard: You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever."
"9","Zack: Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?"
"9","Howard: Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons."
"9","Leonard: And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system."
"9","Zack: Is it better than the one they use now?"
"9","Howard: A lot."
"9","Leonard: Way better."
"9","Zack: Huh. You sure you guys are smart?"
"9","Sheldon: H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220."
"9","Bernadette: I’m sorry, I have to ask."
"9","Sheldon: When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it."
"9","Bernadette: What is it about trains that you like so much?"
"9","Sheldon: What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t."
"9","Bernadette: That’s lovely, Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic."
"9","Leonard: I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this."
"9","Howard: Me, too."
"9","Leonard: Why didn’t you say something?"
"9","Howard: Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic."
"9","Raj: You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes."
"9","Amy: It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons."
"9","Penny: E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light."
"9","Amy: How do you know that?"
"9","Penny: Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer."
"9","Claire: Hey, Raj."
"9","Raj: Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it."
"9","Leonard: Would you like a glass of wine?"
"9","Raj: I said no questions."
"9","Sheldon: And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons."
"9","Bernadette: Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right."
"9","Sheldon: You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you."
"9","Bernadette: Okay, but just for a little bit."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop."
"9","Bernadette: All right."
"9","Sheldon: Ready?"
"9","Bernadette: You bet."
"9","Sheldon: Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall."
"9","Bernadette: Oh. I like the idea of being tall."
"9","Sheldon: I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs."
"9","Bernadette: This is getting fun. What’s next?"
"9","Sheldon: You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months."
"9","Sheldon: What do you do?"
"9","Bernadette: I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin."
"9","Sheldon: He wants to see I.D."
"9","Amy: So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you."
"9","Claire: Really? Like what?"
"9","Amy: Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them."
"9","Zack: Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice."
"9","Raj: Zack, this is my friend Claire."
"9","Zack: You’re hot. You seeing anybody?"
"9","Raj: Uh, she’s seeing me."
"9","Zack: Why’d you say she’s your friend?"
"9","Raj: We’re just keeping it casual."
"9","Zack: Why is he being casual with you? You seem great."
"9","Claire: I don’t know. Ask him."
"9","Zack: Why are you being casual with her? She seems great."
"9","Scene: The toilets."
"9","Leonard: Maybe we should take a step back."
"9","Howard: Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more."
"9","Leonard: No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system."
"9","Howard: But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money."
"9","Leonard: What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?"
"9","Howard: Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world."
"9","Leonard: How?"
"9","Howard: Because no one from the future has come back to kill us."
"9","Leonard: Very funny."
"9","Howard: You got something better?"
"9","Leonard: Well, not really."
"9","Howard: Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?"
"9","Leonard: Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away."
"9","Sheldon: The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?"
"9","Bernadette: Does it have eyes?"
"9","Sheldon: Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling."
"9","Bernadette: I stab it in the middle eye."
"9","Sheldon: Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah."
"9","Bernadette: Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn."
"9","Sheldon: Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end."
"9","Bernadette: Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast."
"9","Bernadette: Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I’m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight."
"9","Sheldon: I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius."
"9","Bernadette: Well, thanks again."
"9","Sheldon: You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting."
"9","Bernadette: I might just take you up on that."
"9","Sheldon: Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot."
"9","Raj: Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire."
"9","Zack: What are you talking about?"
"9","Raj: I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me."
"9","Zack: Oh, man, I didn’t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA."
"9","Raj: Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is."
"9","Zack: Anything for you, my little foreign friend."
"9","Claire: So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?"
"9","Penny: Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do."
"9","Leonard: I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault."
"9","Howard: Yeah. He still has an AOL address."
"9","Zack: I see what you’re saying. She’s not so great."
"9","Raj: Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco."
"9","Zack: Polo."
"9","Raj: So, uh, what are you guys talking about?"
"9","Claire: Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating."
"9","Raj: Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that."
"9","Penny: We didn’t."
"9","Amy: You just did."
"9","Zack: Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart."
"9","Leonard: Morning."
"9","Sheldon: Morning."
"9","Leonard: Ugh. Too much wine."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog."
"9","Leonard: Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?"
"9","Sheldon: Of course."
"9","Leonard: Does it bother you?"
"9","Sheldon: No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective."
"9","Leonard: Who are these people?"
"9","Sheldon: Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink."
"9","Series 09 Episode 23 – The Line Substitution Solution"
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Penny: Helium."
"9","Sheldon: Yes."
"9","Penny: Yes."
"9","Sheldon: Taylor Swift."
"9","Penny: Yes. Pi."
"9","Sheldon: Yes. Kardashian."
"9","Penny: More specific."
"9","Sheldon: Khloe?"
"9","Sheldon: See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe."
"9","Penny: Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?"
"9","Leonard: What are you guys doing?"
"9","Sheldon: Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases."
"9","Leonard: Oh, let me try."
"9","Penny: Okay."
"9","Leonard: Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop."
"9","Sheldon: I’m sorry, who is Mike Drop?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?"
"9","Penny: Sure."
"9","Leonard: Thanks."
"9","Penny: No problem."
"9","Leonard: Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?"
"9","Sheldon: Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?"
"9","Leonard: Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life."
"9","Sheldon: She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone."
"9","Penny: You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?"
"9","Leonard: Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond."
"9","Penny: Or a way for you to avoid her?"
"9","Leonard: I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever."
"9","Penny: Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up."
"9","Leonard: Seriously?"
"9","Penny: Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d like for us to have a good relationship."
"9","Leonard: That is very mature of you, so I’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah."
"9","Sheldon: All right, back to learning."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy."
"9","Penny: Or as I know him?"
"9","Sheldon: Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars."
"9","Penny: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The comic book store."
"9","Raj: Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers."
"9","Leonard: When’s the screening?"
"9","Raj: Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line."
"9","Howard: Let’s do it."
"9","Leonard: Penny’s busy with my mother, so I’m in."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go."
"9","Leonard: You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?"
"9","Howard: In fact, that’s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?"
"9","Raj: Uh, I’d say by three."
"9","Sheldon: You’re really going without me?"
"9","Leonard: It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you."
"9","Sheldon: You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting."
"9","Leonard: People do it all the time."
"9","Sheldon: You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
"9","Howard: If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines."
"9","Stuart: People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life."
"9","Howard: Some of these guys make over $20 an hour."
"9","Stuart: And now I feel worse again."
"9","Scene: Penny’s car."
"9","Beverly: I’m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He’s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?"
"9","Penny: Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?"
"9","Beverly: Dear, I’m a psychiatrist. You don’t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me."
"9","Penny: Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs."
"9","Beverly: Very well. What’s the last book you read?"
"9","Penny: Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?"
"9","Beverly: Penny, it’s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?"
"9","Penny: Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?"
"9","Beverly: And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?"
"9","Penny: Uncomfortable."
"9","Beverly: That was a joke, dear."
"9","Penny: Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?"
"9","Beverly: So just the two of us?"
"9","Penny: Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine."
"9","Scene: Amy’s car."
"9","Stuart: Hey."
"9","Amy: What are you doing here? You’re not Sheldon."
"9","Stuart: I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you."
"9","Amy: Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?"
"9","Stuart: No, it’s not like that. There’s a long line he’d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way."
"9","Amy: We’re not going shopping together."
"9","Stuart: You sure? I’m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick."
"9","Amy: Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?"
"9","Stuart: Look, lady, I just work here."
"9","Scene: The cinema line."
"9","Howard: We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?"
"9","Sheldon: Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?"
"9","Raj: Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do."
"9","Leonard: Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets."
"9","Sheldon: Stuart, what are you doing here?"
"9","Stuart: Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?"
"9","Sheldon: I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?"
"9","Stuart: Oh, I’m not upset with you, but Amy’s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it."
"9","Sheldon: Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play."
"9","Stuart: You’re darn right it’s fair play, you selfish jerk."
"9","Scene: Penny’s apartment."
"9","Amy: You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?"
"9","Beverly: Maybe he couldn’t get a word in edgewise."
"9","Amy: I’m sorry, I’ve been going on and on."
"9","Beverly: Oh, it’s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying."
"9","Amy: I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test."
"9","Beverly: Well, I do admire your resolve. You’re an extraordinary woman."
"9","Amy: Thank you."
"9","Penny: You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?"
"9","Bernadette: Amy’s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You’re with her son, who she doesn’t."
"9","Amy: Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?"
"9","Beverly: Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon."
"9","Amy: Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg."
"9","Penny: You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges."
"9","Beverly: Yes. Well, what can you do?"
"9","Amy (knock on door): Maybe it’s Sheldon, here to say he’s sorry."
"9","(knock on door)"
"9","Stuart: Sheldon says he’s sorry."
"9","Amy: Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door."
"9","Stuart: I would have done it for three."
"9","Raj: Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair."
"9","Howard: Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing."
"9","Raj: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy."
"9","Sheldon: Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?"
"9","Stuart: Uh, no, she’s still pretty mad."
"9","Sheldon: Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?"
"9","Stuart: I said, Sheldon says he’s sorry."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick."
"9","Leonard: You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?"
"9","Sheldon: I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I’ll lose my spot."
"9","Stuart: I’m happy to hold your place till you get back."
"9","Sheldon: You would do that?"
"9","Stuart: Consider it my way of getting more of your money."
"9","Sheldon: You’re a good man."
"9","Bernadette: So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?"
"9","Beverly: Oh, I didn’t realize you two work together."
"9","Bernadette: Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team."
"9","Beverly: Oh, what are you currently developing?"
"9","Bernadette: Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs."
"9","Beverly: That’s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety."
"9","Amy: Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk."
"9","Beverly: It was."
"9","Bernadette: Well, let’s get back to Penny. Hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?"
"9","Penny: Um, it has seat warmers."
"9","Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy."
"9","(Knock, knock, knock)"
"9","Amy: Come in."
"9","Sheldon: Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh."
"9","Amy: Fine."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, thanks, you’re a peach. Beverly, we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth."
"9","Penny: How long have I had spinach in my teeth?"
"9","Beverly: Since the airport, dear."
"9","Howard: You look like you come with a kickstand."
"9","Raj: You can’t make me feel bad."
"9","Howard: Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?"
"9","Leonard: So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?"
"9","Sheldon: I’m back."
"9","Leonard: Hey, how’d it go?"
"9","Sheldon: It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties."
"9","Stuart: Anyone else need anything before I go?"
"9","Howard: I’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj."
"9","Stuart: That’s mean."
"9","Howard: Five."
"9","Stuart: You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass."
"9","Howard: Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know."
"9","Man: Hey, guys."
"9","Woman: You made it."
"9","Sheldon: Did you see that? He just cut the line."
"9","Leonard: He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine."
"9","Sheldon: No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette."
"9","Howard: We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way."
"9","Sheldon: What if every person in front of us let someone cut?"
"9","Leonard: We’d still get in."
"9","Sheldon: What if each of those people let someone cut?"
"9","Leonard: Still get in."
"9","Sheldon: But then each of those people let someone cut?"
"9","Leonard: We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me."
"9","Leonard: Oh, please don’t."
"9","Sheldon: Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line."
"9","Man: Oh, uh, I’m with my friends. It’s cool."
"9","Sheldon: Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here."
"9","Leonard: No."
"9","Sheldon: You need to go to the back of the line."
"9","Man: Uh, who made you line monitor?"
"9","Sheldon: Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great."
"9","Man: Is this guy for real?"
"9","Leonard: Boy, I wish I could say no."
"9","Beverly: That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize."
"9","Amy: Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way."
"9","Beverly: Your relationship with him is fascinating. I’m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you."
"9","Amy: Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut."
"9","Beverly: Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?"
"9","Bernadette: Do I think he’d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom."
"9","Beverly: Wonderful. I’ll give you my contact information."
"9","Bernadette: Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too."
"9","Beverly: About what?"
"9","Penny: Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I’m getting nowhere."
"9","Beverly: Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?"
"9","Penny: What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to my face."
"9","Beverly: My intention was never to insult you."
"9","Penny: You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?"
"9","Beverly: Well, it’s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place."
"9","Penny: Okay, good example."
"9","Sheldon: What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?"
"9","Man: The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description."
"9","Sheldon: They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?"
"9","Man: As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV."
"9","Raj: He’s got him there. The D even stands for department."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?"
"9","Man: Told you."
"9","Sheldon: Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you."
"9","Howard: I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair."
"9","Sheldon: You know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks."
"9","Leonard: Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here."
"9","Sheldon: Now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…"
"9","Woman: Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself."
"9","Sheldon: I most certainly did not."
"9","Woman: I saw you."
"9","Man: If you’re feeling dizzy, it’s because the tables have turned."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in."
"9","Leonard: Buddy, let it go."
"9","Sheldon: No, I can’t. This isn’t right."
"9","Leonard: You did everything you could."
"9","Sheldon: No, I could’ve done more."
"9","Leonard: Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask."
"9","Penny: To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all."
"9","Beverly: I’m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore."
"9","Amy: I know how you feel. She didn’t invite any of us."
"9","Penny: It was spur of the moment."
"9","Bernadette: But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet."
"9","Beverly: I could’ve watched it on the Internet?"
"9","Penny: Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?"
"9","Beverly: No, I would’ve said you’re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would’ve been nice."
"9","Penny: You really think we made a mistake?"
"9","Beverly: At the time I did. But I’ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong."
"9","Penny: Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested."
"9","Beverly: I would find that perfectly acceptable."
"9","Penny: She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom."
"9","Bernadette: Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while."
"9","Howard (through bathroom door): I’m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that’s a good question, Jim. Don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question."

"9","Series 09 Episode 24 – The Convergence Convergence"
"9","Scene: Leonard and Penny’s bedroom."
"9","Leonard: Hey."
"9","Penny: Hi, how was the screening?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad."
"9","Penny: Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month."
"9","Leonard: How’d it go with my mother?"
"9","Penny: Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place."
"9","Leonard: Wow. Well done."
"9","Penny: Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug."
"9","Leonard: Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her."
"9","Penny: No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time."
"9","Leonard: Wait, we’re gonna get married again?"
"9","Penny: Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family."
"9","Leonard: Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug."
"9","Penny: Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one."
"9","Leonard: Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her."
"9","Penny: Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?"
"9","Leonard: I just said why, we don’t like her."
"9","Penny: Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families."
"9","Leonard: Is your brother out of prison?"
"9","Penny: Thanks to overcrowding, yeah."
"9","Leonard: I’d love it if my dad could come."
"9","Penny: Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce."
"9","Leonard: Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half."
"9","Penny: Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you."
"9","Credits sequence."
"9","Scene: The apartment."
"9","Penny: Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it."
"9","Amy: So there’s no maid of honour?"
"9","Penny: No."
"9","Amy: Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?"
"9","Penny: I don’t see how I could."
"9","Amy: Then I graciously accept."
"9","Bernadette: Who’s going to officiate?"
"9","Penny: I was kind of hoping you would."
"9","Amy: Wait, now I’m just some lousy maid of honour?"
"9","Sheldon: Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding."
"9","Penny: Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?"
"9","Sheldon: Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik."
"9","Bernadette: Who’s Erno Rubik?"
"9","Sheldon: Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube."
"9","Penny: Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?"
"9","Sheldon: Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man."
"9","Bernadette: Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother."
"9","Penny: Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship."
"9","Scene: Leonard’s car."
"9","Beverly: How dare you invite your father without consulting me."
"9","Leonard: Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding."
"9","Beverly: You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair."
"9","Leonard: I know, and there’s no excuse for that."
"9","Beverly: He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn’t shown him any physical affection for years."
"9","Leonard: I was wrong, there’s three excuses for that."
"9","Scene: Howard’s workshop."
"9","Howard: Oh, my God. It’s working."
"9","Raj: You sure?"
"9","Howard: Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation."
"9","Raj: You’re right. You realize what this means?"
"9","Howard: Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system."
"9","Raj: Congratulations."
"9","Howard: Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force."
"9","Raj: Open it."
"9","Howard: Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That’s weird."
"9","Raj: Is there a window around here we don’t know about?"
"9","Howard: I’m sure it’s just a coincidence."
"9","Raj: Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America."
"9","Scene: Amy’s car."
"9","Mary Cooper: Thank you for picking me up."
"9","Sheldon: Oh, you’re welcome."
"9","Mary: I was speaking to your young lady."
"9","Amy: My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper."
"9","Mary: Oh, please call me Mary."
"9","Amy: Okay, Mary."
"9","Sheldon: You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper."
"9","Mary: Sheldon, don’t be silly."
"9","Sheldon: Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better."
"9","Mary: It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me."
"9","Sheldon: Well, actually, I…"
"9","Amy: It sure was."
"9","Mary: I’ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years."
"9","Sheldon: Excuse me, I take care of him."
"9","Mary: Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?"
"9","Amy: Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny’s family is coming tomorrow."
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here."
"9","Mary: Oh, Beverly. How nice."
"9","Amy: You’ve met her, right?"
"9","Mary: Yes, I have."
"9","Sheldon: Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire."
"9","Mary: Either way, let’s stop and get some garlic."
"9","Beverly: So, Mary, how have you been?"
"9","Mary: Well, thank you so much for asking. I’ve been well, and you?"
"9","Beverly: Very good."
"9","Mary: Good."
"9","Sheldon: I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great."
"9","Mary: Sheldon tells me your husband’s coming."
"9","Beverly: My ex-husband."
"9","Mary: Oh, I’m so sorry."
"9","Beverly: Don’t be."
"9","Mary: All right."
"9","Penny: Whew, chilly."
"9","Amy: I think I can see my breath."
"9","Beverly: We can hear you."
"9","Penny: Sorry."
"9","Amy: Sorry."
"9","Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen."
"9","Howard: I can’t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four."
"9","Bernadette: Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting."
"9","Howard: Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho."
"9","Raj: Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention."
"9","Howard: Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over."
"9","Bernadette: You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?"
"9","Howard: I’m sorry, you find this funny?"
"9","Raj: No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible."
"9","Scene: The foyer."
"9","Leonard: Oh, we have to use the stairs."
"9","Alfred Hofstadter: When are they gonna fix your elevator?"
"9","Leonard: Uh, I don’t, any day now."
"9","Alfred: Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I’ll have a heart attack and not have to see her."
"9","Leonard: Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I’m really glad you’re here."
"9","Alfred: Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine."
"9","Leonard: Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you."
"9","Alfred: Ah, she’s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard."
"9","Leonard: Thanks, Dad."
"9","Alfred: How the hell did you do that?"
"9","Sheldon: Isn’t this nice?"
"9","Leonard: Hey, we’re here."
"9","Penny: Alfred. Thank you for coming!"
"9","Alfred: Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations."
"9","Penny: Thank you."
"9","Leonard: Dad, you remember Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: Dr. Hofstadter."
"9","Alfred: Dr. Cooper."
"9","Leonard: This is Sheldon’s mother, Mary."
"9","Alfred: How do you do?"
"9","Mary: Nice to meet you."
"9","Leonard: And his girlfriend, Amy."
"9","Alfred: A pleasure."
"9","Amy: Hi."
"9","Leonard: And, of course, Mom."
"9","Alfred: Hello, my hateful shrew."
"9","Beverly: Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard."
"9","Sheldon: All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension."
"9","Leonard: All right, you two, don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?"
"9","Alfred: Of course. I’m sorry."
"9","Beverly: Oh, look at that, you can apologize."
"9","Leonard: Mom."
"9","Beverly: I’m sorry."
"9","Mary: You know, the Bible says forgiveness…"
"9","Sheldon: Mom."
"9","Mary: I’m sorry."
"9","Penny: Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town."
"9","Sheldon: It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp."
"9","Amy: Sheldon."
"9","Sheldon: I’m not sorry. That’s true."
"9","Howard: I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?"
"9","Raj: You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist."
"9","Bernadette: Guys, come on. We’re meeting everyone for dinner."
"9","Howard: One sec. I’m just afraid if I respond, then they’ll know I got it."
"9","Raj: Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America."
"9","Bernadette: Are you done with this nonsense?"
"9","Howard: It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works."
"9","Raj: Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American."
"9","Howard: You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us."
"9","Raj: I also love the enemies of America."
"9","Beverly: Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard’s father doesn’t discourage you from the commitment you’ve made to one another."
"9","Penny: No, of course not."
"9","Beverly: Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two."
"9","Leonard: Mom, please save something for the toast."
"9","Mary: So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?"
"9","Alfred: Oh, I’m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures."
"9","Mary: My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood."
"9","Sheldon: Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking."
"9","Amy: Play with your phone."
"9","Alfred: Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology."
"9","Mary: I don’t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that’s very interesting."
"9","Alfred: Oh. I, I didn’t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it."
"9","Mary: Really?"
"9","Alfred: Yes. Yes, I’m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt."
"9","Mary: Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice."
"9","Scene: Howard’s car."
"9","Raj: Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help."
"9","Howard: Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place."
"9","Raj: What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side."
"9","Howard: I’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam."
"9","Bernadette: Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you."
"9","Raj: I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me."
"9","Penny: You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?"
"9","Beverly: Yeah."
"9","Leonard: Is that Howard in front of us?"
"9","Penny: Oh, maybe. Get closer."
"9","Howard’s car."
"9","Howard: Oh, God. I think someone’s following us."
"9","Bernadette: You’re being ridiculous."
"9","Howard: I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail."
"9","Raj: Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us."
"9","Leonard’s car."
"9","Penny: Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way."
"9","Leonard: I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident."
"9","Penny: Oh, so follow him."
"9","Raj: Oh, no."
"9","Howard: I told you."
"9","Bernadette: It’s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you."
"9","Penny: Well, go faster. You’re losing him."
"9","Leonard: What is his hurry?"
"9","Penny: You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s you."
"9","Howard: He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?"
"9","Raj: I, I think he wants us to pull over."
"9","Bernadette: Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone."
"9","Howard: Hang on."
"9","Scene: The restaurant."
"9","Alfred: So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?"
"9","Mary: No, just focused on work and the church."
"9","Alfred: Ah. And what do you do?"
"9","Mary: I work at the church."
"9","Alfred: Well, they’re lucky to have you."
"9","Mary: Well, thank you."
"9","Alfred: You’re welcome."
"9","Amy: Do you realize what’s happening here?"
"9","Sheldon: Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal."
"9","Penny: Hey."
"9","Amy: What took you guys so long?"
"9","Leonard: Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street."
"9","Penny: So, what did we miss?"
"9","Alfred: Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little."
"9","Mary: Leonard, your father is just charming."
"9","Beverly: He’s also broke. Did he mention that?"
"9","Leonard: Okay, Mom, you sit over there."
"9","Penny: Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them."
"9","Sheldon: If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread."
"9","Bernadette (on phone): Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don’t you go ahead and eat. We’re gonna be a while."
"9","(on phone)"
"9","Howard: I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me."
"9","Alfred: Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other."
"9","Mary: Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon’s father."
"9","Sheldon: That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man."
"9","Amy: I’d be lost without you."
"9","Leonard: Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be."
"9","Sheldon: See, that’s funny because…"
"9","Amy: Back to your phone."
"9","Leonard: Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes."
"9","Penny: Oh, thanks for asking until I did."
"9","Amy: Hear, hear."
"9","Leonard: Cheers."
"9","Alfred: I, uh, I would also like to make a toast."
"9","Penny: Aw."
"9","Alfred: Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you."
"9","Beverly: What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
"9","Alfred: Why don’t you take a pill?"
"9","Beverly: Like you did before sex?"
"9","Alfred: What I really needed was a blindfold."
"9","Mary: All right, everyone, calm down. Let’s all remember what it says in the Bible: He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty."
"9","Beverly: Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?"
"9","Mary: When God writes one, I will."
"9","Penny: Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that."
"9","Alfred: Leonard, if you don’t mind, I, I think I’m a little tired. I’m gonna call it a night."
"9","Leonard: Sure, Dad."
"9","Mary: I’m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning."
"9","Alfred: Would you like to share a cab?"
"9","Mary: That would be fine."
"9","Alfred: Where are you staying?"
"9","Mary: I’m at the Westin."
"9","Alfred: Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?"
"9","Mary: I think that you could."
"9","Leonard: What is happening there?"
"9","Sheldon: I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread."
"9","Sheldon: She’s still not answering."
"9","Leonard: My father’s not texting me back."
"9","Penny: ‘Cause they both turned their phones off."
"9","Sheldon: I don’t like this at all."
"9","Leonard: I don’t like it either."
"9","Penny: Really? ‘Cause I love it."
